And he would be proved right. In 1980, after a decades-long public health campaign that included widespread vaccination, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/smallpox" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;smallpox had been eradicated&lt;/a&gt;. It remains the only infectious disease where this has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A sleugh of other vaccines have been developed against other diseases, from influenza to human papillomavirus infections that cause certain cancers and the Sars-COV-2 virus behind Covid-19. In the past 50 years, an estimated &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00850-X/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;154 million lives have been saved by vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, according to one recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Yet, opposition to vaccines – or hesitancy about accepting them – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/1/31" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;is widespread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jgrlxx37do" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt; in many parts of the world, even percolating into the uppermost branches of governments responsible for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q41qm9pvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;improving public health&lt;/a&gt;. This week, US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr was quizzed by the Senate Finance Committee over his vaccine policies, resulting in fiery exchanges. On the same day, the surgeon general of Florida also announced plans to &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62q41qm9pvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;end vaccine mandates in the state&lt;/a&gt;.

Why do they face protests from relatively small, but vocal, segments of the public? And how have these arguments evolved? This is a look at the long, and strange history of the anti-vax movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Back in the early 1800s, a series of controlled experiments by Jenner and other doctors quickly showed inoculation to be extremely effective, granting immunity against smallpox in well over 95% of those vaccinated. Public health authorities worldwide took action to roll it out. In the UK, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination_Act" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a series of Vaccination Acts&lt;/a&gt;, passed in 1840, 1853 and 1871, made immunisation for children first free, then compulsory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 09:01:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOYlpHZkJTV0V4bFNwVWNTNXMxdXJ1UzhZd09sNTVVX0RUaUlJb0pVWjBWaDNLT1ZNRjJMUGRXVVJhYnhXVE5XejRaSnVTSk9tZzRRR3h0dXplTlpvLVpONVRIZXVpbFdPZVpybmk4aGpxeTdrUUZ2SXpJU0hYcWc1RkZUTGNWSVpuUGo0d29IZHRMeXRUVGNn</guid></item><item><title>在亚马逊上购买Halle Berry的亲密和健康产品- TMZ</title><link>https://www.tmz.com/2025/09/07/halle-berry-respin-intimacy-products/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;header class="article__header"&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Family cancer syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hereditary (or family) cancer syndrome is a rare disorder in which family members have a higher-than-average risk of developing certain types of cancer. The disorder is caused by inherited genetic variants in cancer-related genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One sign a family may be affected is if multiple members get diagnosed with the same kind of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier explained that, during a routine visit, physicians will typically take a family history of cancer dating back at least three generations. If there is any history of early-onset cancers, the doctor will usually suggest genetic counseling and testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no outrunning genetics, experts say there are ways to lead a healthier life and reduce your risk of developing cancer yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key to prevention is a combination of healthy lifestyle and staying proactive with checkups, said Dr Cedrek McFadden, a surgeon and associate professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts reveal six ways you can reduce your risk of developing genetic cancers that run in your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A multitude of research has linked physical activity to lower cancer risk, including cancers of the breasts and colon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No matter the type of cancer in your family, Dr McFadden and Dr Messier both suggest regular exercise to reduce your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said people should aim to get 150 minutes of exercise a week - or about 20 to 30 minutes per day, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But don’t let perfect be the enemy of good,' Dr McFadden said. 'Even a brisk 20-minute walk most days adds up. Just move; your body will thank you for it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Helen Messier told the Daily Mail diet can be a key way to reduce cancer risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said if lung cancer, specifically, runs in your family, exercise is key as 'healthy lungs love movement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier added: 'Exercise controls insulin, soothes inflammation, helps balance hormones and maintains weight - all fundamental cancer-prevention mechanisms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A multitude of research has linked physical activity to lower cancer risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2022 study in Cancer Cell International found physical activity may reduce the risk of colon cancer, which impacts about 107,000 people per year, by 23 percent when comparing people who exercise the most to those who exercise the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study published in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology suggested physical activity could prevent nearly 15 percent of colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For breast cancer, which will see about 320,000 new cases this year, a 2016 analysis published in the European Journal of Cancer found the most physically active women had a 12 to 21 percent lower risk than those who were least physically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2020 study in the British Journal of Cancer found women who reported the most exercise per week had a 23 percent decreased risk of breast cancer compared to those who exercised the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Diet &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier said a clean and healthy diet can be crucial for reducing all types of cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said if colon cancer runs in your family, avoiding processed meats like bacon, sausage and deli products can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A diet high in fiber, fruits, vegetables and whole grains has also been found to lower colon cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McFadden echoed those sentiments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'If [a parent] had colon cancer, it's worth cutting back on processed meats... and even limiting red meat in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I tell my patients to lean into a fiber-rich diet... Your gut bacteria thrive on that, and over time, that supports a healthier colon.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, both experts said no food is a magic bullet, but the Mediterranean diet 'gets a lot of praise for a reason'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It includes 'lots of plant-based foods, healthy fats like olive oil, lean proteins and fewer processed snacks or sugary drinks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors agree that, 'Basically, if it grew from the ground, it’s probably good for you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier also &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12471615/DR-MICHAEL-MOSLEY-eating-olive-oil-nuts-fish-Living-like-Med-good.html"&gt;said a 'Mediterranean-type diet abundant in the plants is the gold standard - packed with vegetables, legumes, whole grains, healthy fats such as olive oil and lean proteins like fish.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Minimize ultra-processed foods, sugars and alcohol. Foods high in phytonutrients, such as berries, cruciferous vegetables, turmeric and green tea also may be protective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight are also two factors to consider when trying to cut your familial cancer risk, Dr Messier said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map from the Environmental Protection Agency. It shows radon levels across the country, which reveal 25% of Americans live in areas where levels are considered unsafe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Avoid toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier told the Mail that even if you have never smoked, a close family member who was a smoker and was eventually diagnosed with lung cancer could still put you at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lung cancer is estimated to affect about 227,000 people in 2025, with 124,000 deaths. People exposed to secondhand smoke have a 20 to 30 percent increased risk of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both doctors advise quitting smoking, avoiding secondhand smoke and steering clear of all tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also urge people to avoid other toxins - particularly radon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier and Dr McFadden recommend testing your home for radon, a radioactive gas that has no color, smell or taste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gas - which comes from the natural decay of uranium, a radioactive element found in nearly all soils - is present in both indoor and outdoor air and there is no known safe level of exposure to the substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14305279/map-radioactive-gas-hotspots-linked-cancer.html"&gt;radon exposure is the second most common cause of lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the US after smoking, leading to about 21,000 deaths each year, according to the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Angelina Jolie (pictured) had her breasts, ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after testing positive for a gene that increases breast and ovarian cancer risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, died of colon cancer at 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Genetic testing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Charles Oyesile, a medical research physician, told the Daily Mail people with a family history of cancer should consult with an oncologist and genetics counselor to assess their individualized risk given their family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing can help determine the best course of action - whether that is undergoing genetic testing to see if you are a carrier of any cancer-related genes, or starting cancer screenings at an earlier age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While genetic tests won't prevent cancer, they can tell you if you are at a heightened risk, which could help you make certain life choices - such as exercising more, quitting smoking, following a cleaner diet or undergoing certain preventative procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the BRCA genes, a blood test can identify genetic variants in the APC gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This tumor suppressor gene is crucial for preventing the development of colon cancer. Mutations in the APC gene can lead to familial adenomatous polyposis, an inheritable condition that causes polyps in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, in turn, raises the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McFadden said, 'In some cases, a genetic test can tell us which screenings you actually need and when. Don’t guess - ask your doctor. We’d much rather have that conversation now than after something shows up later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Prophylactic surgery&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having prophylactic surgery to remove organs that increase your risk of cancer is one way to fend off a familial pattern of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, if genetic testing shows you carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, you may opt for a prophylactic double mastectomy (removal of the breasts) or oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) - procedures Angelina Jolie had when she found out she was a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jolie underwent genetic testing because her mother battled cancer for nearly a decade and died at 56. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she tested positive for the BRCA1 gene, doctors estimated Jolie had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She chose to have both breasts removed and get implants in 2013. Her chances of developing breast cancer dropped to 5 percent, she &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;in a piece for The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years later, she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to prevent ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other types of preventive surgeries include a colectomy - where part or all of the colon is removed to prevent colorectal cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Preventative screenings &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Screenings also won't prevent cancer, but they can help detect the disease in earlier stages - and an early-stage diagnosis means the cancer may be easier to treat and could have a higher survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your grandmother, mother or sister was diagnosed with breast cancer, Dr Messier suggests talking to your doctor about beginning screenings like mammograms earlier than the generally recommended starting age of 40 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr McFadden said a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer may be warranted earlier than recommended - typically 45 years old - if a sibling was diagnosed with the cancer before the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's where personalized screening plans come in,' he said, 'and they can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Screenings are] not one-size-fits-all. If it’s colon cancer, you might start colonoscopy earlier. If it’s breast or prostate cancer, we might begin mammograms or PSA testing sooner.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Family cancer syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hereditary (or family) cancer syndrome is a rare disorder in which family members have a higher-than-average risk of developing certain types of cancer. The disorder is caused by inherited genetic variants in cancer-related genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One sign a family may be affected is if multiple members get diagnosed with the same kind of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier explained that, during a routine visit, physicians will typically take a family history of cancer dating back at least three generations. If there is any history of early-onset cancers, the doctor will usually suggest genetic counseling and testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no outrunning genetics, experts say there are ways to lead a healthier life and reduce your risk of developing cancer yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key to prevention is a combination of healthy lifestyle and staying proactive with checkups, said Dr Cedrek McFadden, a surgeon and associate professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts reveal six ways you can reduce your risk of developing genetic cancers that run in your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A multitude of research has linked physical activity to lower cancer risk, including cancers of the breasts and colon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No matter the type of cancer in your family, Dr McFadden and Dr Messier both suggest regular exercise to reduce your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said people should aim to get 150 minutes of exercise a week - or about 20 to 30 minutes per day, five days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But don’t let perfect be the enemy of good,' Dr McFadden said. 'Even a brisk 20-minute walk most days adds up. Just move; your body will thank you for it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Helen Messier told the Daily Mail diet can be a key way to reduce cancer risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also said if lung cancer, specifically, runs in your family, exercise is key as 'healthy lungs love movement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Messier added: 'Exercise controls insulin, soothes inflammation, helps balance hormones and maintains weight - all fundamental cancer-prevention mechanisms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A multitude of research has linked physical activity to lower cancer risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2022 study in Cancer Cell International found physical activity may reduce the risk of colon cancer, which impacts about 107,000 people per year, by 23 percent when comparing people who exercise the most to those who exercise the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study published in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology suggested physical activity could prevent nearly 15 percent of colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For breast cancer, which will see about 320,000 new cases this year, a 2016 analysis published in the European Journal of Cancer found the most physically active women had a 12 to 21 percent lower risk than those who were least physically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2020 study in the British Journal of Cancer found women who reported the most exercise per week had a 23 percent decreased risk of breast cancer compared to those who exercised the least.&lt;/p&gt;

If it’s breast or prostate cancer, we might begin mammograms or PSA testing sooner.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It said no &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials are actively conducting contact tracing to notify those who may have been exposed to the individual. The health department said there were no exposures in Grand County schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are asking anyone who experiences the following symptoms of measles (which normally appear after 7-14 days), especially those who are unvaccinated or were exposed to a known case, to contact their health care provider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that starts on the face and spreads downward&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent the illness is receiving the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is "safe and highly effective, providing lifelong protection for most individuals," the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, two school-aged children in Washington County tested positive for measles, according to the Southwest Utah Public Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children's schools were notified of potential exposure and all unvaccinated children and adults who believe they had been exposed to the disease were encouraged to stay home for 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 02:29:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPbXNuUDVHb3VSM1ZySTBPMTR6LURUTHZfOGw5Y1B4UDdQTElkbUhsTEJqWU54QXZ1anl1WUxaY0lHOWEyLTVsaER1NXBjV2VHMWZGdUNQSzZCMWp3S1FxZEtOTE1CRjdaMGl0OWhGcnNKeDNDQWI5YVhWNjNXNUpnUzdXT29kVmlpSjJRa0hnbHVZdGlZQ3JSMnZDbHo</guid></item><item><title>致命的“接吻虫”蔓延到美国各地；哪些州受到影响，以及如何保护自己免受南美锥虫病的侵害？ -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/deadly-kissing-bugs-spreading-across-us-which-states-are-affected-and-how-to-protect-yourself-from-chagas-disease/articleshow/123742147.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heads up, the bugs are here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a tiny but mighty threat silently crawling into our lives: the kissing bugs. These blood-sucking insects are spreading across the United States of America, and carrying a sneaky parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, the culprit behind Chagas disease. Often overlooked, this disease can lead to serious cardiac and intestinal troubles down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC now reports kissing bugs in 32 states, and human cases have popped up in several, including California and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kissing bugs and Chagas: What’s going on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is caused by the parasite T. cruzi, typically transmitted when an infected kissing bug bites and then defecates near the entrance site. If you accidentally rub feces into the bite, eyes, or mouth, the parasite can sneak in. Symptoms in the early (acute) stage are often mild or unnoticeable; think fever, fatigue, headache, or eyelid swelling (the hallmark “Romaña’s sign”). But many cases go undiagnosed until the chronic phase, years later, when a frightening 20–30% can develop serious heart problems like heart failure or arrhythmias, or digestive issues. Antiparasitic treatments exist, but they’re most effective early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which US states are affected?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs (scientists call them triatomine insects) have now been reported across 32 states, with human cases confirmed in eight, including California, Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, most sightings happen in the Sierra Nevada foothills, Los Angeles, and San Diego deserts, where wild mammals (opossums, raccoons, rats) thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Key pointers:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;32 states have documented kissing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human infections confirmed in at least eight states: California, Texas, Arizona, Louisiana, Tennessee, Missouri, Mississippi, and Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;California: Especially bugs in Southern California are carrying T. cruzi, with infections noted in Los Angeles and San Diego counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas: The state has become a hotspot, with 50 locally acquired human cases (2013-2023), dogs in certain kennels showing up to 31% infection rates, and kissing bugs testing positive in 30-50% of samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southern states in general: Due to abundant wildlife and suitable ecological conditions, these states are seeing more kissing bug activity. Wildlife like raccoons, opossums, armadillos, and others help sustain the parasite cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does Chagas disease spread?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A kissing bug bites, often around the face, and then drops infected feces near the wound. If you scratch or touch it, the dangerous parasite Trypanosoma cruzi enters your body. It can also spread via contaminated blood, organ transplants, or mother-to-baby transmission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms to watch out for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chagas has two phases:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Acute phase:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Often mild or unnoticed.

They have a pointed, cone-shaped head and long, thin legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fortify your home:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seal cracks and crevices around doors, windows, and walls. Install sturdy screens and keep outdoor lighting to a minimum at night. Keep pet sleeping areas clean; bugs often get in via dirty or pet-filled spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Handle bugs safely:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Never touch kissing bugs with your bare hands. Instead, trap them carefully using gloves and a container, and then contact local health or pest control authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Monitor symptoms and get tested:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you experience unexplained fever, fatigue, swollen eyelids, or other unusual signs, especially if bitten by a bug, see a doctor and ask about Chagas. Blood tests can confirm infection; early antiparasitic treatment (like benznidazole or nifurtimox) can clear the parasite if caught early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Protect pets and loved ones:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pregnant women or those receiving blood transfusions should be extra cautious, as Chagas disease can be transmitted congenitally or through contaminated blood/organs. Additionally, dogs are common victims, especially in kennels, and can even become reservoirs, passing the parasite back into the bug population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Coronavirus outbreak: How to protect yourself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 01:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAJBVV95cUxQSXQtZS1sbk9UX29qZm43WDlRV3RybU5QWGRvTTk2X0U4N3lWcTlMSVNTZnExOEVYbjNBaGZ5MnpHMlhHT0ZkOHh2Zl9ld2xpcVhQNTBVZUR6Z2V4RFZVSGkwaEtVTmR6bUJxM2pfdlN2ZnNSWXI3b2FpYm0wdUNzeHRSUU45M2lSOE1oM3ZLOS1JZGZfMDlzSTlCMnpJVlFVWWxFV1ZhSXlpdXRsc0Q2YWo3RmhabXJoMnhaOVNVT0JLbjVjMHlYMU1Tb1UyOHJZUmtKdURZNWJidERvdlJpOWF0YlRrSzBueEgtTV81Z3RrNGxScHpHNmhPWjBhS09ZUnFaSnZvVlZnWGNJS2N1b3E2S2hTbUNVZzhqMkR1bWhnbVh3ZjE2c3RHdzYyX29LX3REZFViUG4</guid></item><item><title>含糖饮料改变肠道DNA ，但Technion研究发现效果可以逆转-研究-耶路撒冷邮报</title><link>https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/nutrition/article-866545</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="menu-title" role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM POST EN ESPANOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="arrow "&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path stroke="#CB133E" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" d="m5.335 13.333 5.333-5.334-5.333-5.333"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Jerusalem Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:23:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE5SS0U2MjVqUUhQaVEzR3Fhb3lnZTFhaVRpWElXRDBVSlFXajVKR0VVTTJEanlPVHZHaHlUWXdDdlVvc2lIVi1VQVdsM2pKNVdtSElTYzE3aXVOdTN5UGVYekxCZDI3R3gzVGVNODhwZ21haE1L</guid></item><item><title>卡通：骨刺科- Daily Kos</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/6/2341987/-Cartoon-Department-of-bone-spurs</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__details"&gt;

Another Reddit post showed a similar digital billboard being towed across the water, also just off the Florida coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's not just beaches, either. Whether you're stuck in traffic, pumping gas, or just going to school, you could now potentially be inundated with advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last year, money spent on advertising in the United States increased 5.6% over 2023 to an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethannkaminkow/2024/04/21/as-ad-spend-rises-marketing-budgets-switch-to-commerce/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$360 billion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;$360 billion&lt;/a&gt; — and that doesn't even include political advertising. All that comes with a high cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Advertising pushes an overall culture of consumerism, where people strive to get the best and latest products.

						&lt;p&gt;An active case of tuberculosis was found at a Wake County high school, just several weeks into the new schoolyear, according to a Wake County spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County, in an email, told WRAL that they were notified that a person with active tuberculosis was present at Leesville High School sometime last week. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The county is working with the Wake County Public School System to identify anyone who may have been in close contact with the person. Those people will be contacted directly with instructions for tuberculosis testing. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;We are working to find out how many people might have been affected by this case. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease that affects the lungs or other parts of the body, such as the brain, kidneys or spine. It is spread through the air when someone with TB coughs, sneezes, sings or speaks, according to county's website. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;TB is not spread by shaking hands, kissing, sharing glasses, plates, utensils, clothing, sheets or furniture. While TB can be spread when someone coughs or sneezes, it cannot be spread throughout the air outside. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;TB symptoms may include: &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;With some states thinking about removing vaccine mandates, Maryland will protect access to vaccines for all of its residents with flu season approaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland residents can go to their providers and pharmacies to get their vaccinations, and get advice on what types of vaccines to get to protect themselves from viruses and illnesses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC recommends to those 6 years and older to get the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comes in the midst of the &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/health-fitness/2025/08/fda-approves-updated-pfizer-covid-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Food and Drug Administration approving updated COVID-19 shots&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, which is limited for some kids and adults with one high-risk health condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The federal government’s rapid changes and unnecessary swirl around vaccine policy is harmful for Marylanders and all Americans, and could result in disastrous public health outcomes,” Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said &lt;a href="https://governor.maryland.gov/news/press/pages/Maryland-Protects-Access-to-Vaccines-for-All-Marylanders.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore added that the state is prepared to deal with the challenges of federal vaccine guidance with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. trying to advance anti-vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He signed a law in 2024 that would allow pharmacists to give those 3 years and over COVID-19 and flu vaccine without a prescription, a release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The health, safety and well-being of Marylanders and their loved ones are our North Star, and we will do everything in our power to ensure they have access to life-saving medicines like vaccines,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts is following Maryland’s playbook in protecting &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/states-move-to-protect-vaccines-in-the-face-of-attempts-to-remove-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vaccine access for its residents&lt;/a&gt;, despite Florida being on the verge of being the &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/florida-will-work-to-eliminate-all-childhood-vaccine-mandates-in-the-state-officials-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first state to to get rid of school vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 8 in 10 U.S. adults said kids should be vaccinated to go to school, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/national/2025/09/what-polls-show-about-americans-views-on-childhood-vaccine-mandates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a Harvard/SSRS poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines continue to be one of the most powerful public health tools for safeguarding our people and communities against disease,” Maryland Department of Health Secretary Dr. Meena Seshamani said.&lt;/p&gt;

Experts say the problem is related to a lack of access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reality was never clearer than Thursday at the Denver Public Library, where &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/new-denver-health-exhibit-aims-to-break-addiction-stigma-during-national-recovery-month" target="_blank"&gt;an exhibit aimed at breaking substance use stigma&lt;/a&gt; became the setting for a life-saving rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the customers of the library came and was talking to some of our staff, and then sat down in the library and fell asleep, but we heard some snoring, and people were checking in on him,” said Brooke Bender, administrative director at Denver Health’s Center for Addiction Medicine. “Eventually, we didn't hear anything else, and the library social worker had stopped by to check on him. They seemed to have known him, that he was a regular visitor of the library.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man became unresponsive, Bender and peer-support specialists acted quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She couldn't get him to respond, and so we jumped into action, and we had the naloxone there at the table as part of our booth, and grabbed that and were able to bring him back,” Bender said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, library staff called 911, and Denver Health paramedics rushed the man to the emergency department, where he survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It saved his life. It was a surprising event that we didn't expect to happen when we were there, sharing pictures and stories of people in recovery,” Bender said. “But it was a powerful reminder that what we're doing really matters, and that this can happen anywhere at any time, and that all of us can be responsible for saving a life if we have naloxone at our fingertips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Bender, the lesson is simple: “Having naloxone with you, even if you don't use substances yourself, gives you the opportunity to support someone else who might need that help. There should be no stigma about taking naloxone whenever you have the opportunity, so that you can carry it and save a life if you need to, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How naloxone works and why community access matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naloxone is simple to use and does not require medical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You do not need to be a medical professional to use this,” Bender said. “Many of the people that we've talked to in the community this week, when we were sharing our 'Stories in Black and White' exhibit, said that they've saved several of their friends and family's lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using naloxone is very straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Naloxone comes in an easy-to-open package. If you just tear off the packaging, there's no cover for the nasal spray. I just took the nasal spray and took it to the person's nose when they're lying down, and put it in one of their nostrils and squeezed,” she explained. “We wait for two to three minutes to see if that's taken effect, if there's any response, if the heart's beating, and check for signs of stability, and if there are none, then you take another dose and put it in the other nostril and spray.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Denver Health created a video demonstrating how to administer naloxone. You can watch it in the video player below&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="HtmlModule"&gt;
    &lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TDQ4cbItN3s?si=wujx880sqRuAoyTo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bender, expired naloxone can still work and should not be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Expired naloxone can still work and should be used. We should not be throwing away expired naloxone that can still save someone's life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breaking down barriers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2025.00263" target="_blank"&gt;Research from Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Safety&lt;/a&gt; highlights ongoing disparities in naloxone access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study looked at the different steps it takes to go from someone becoming aware that naloxone is a thing, that it can help, to them having it on their person when it would be necessary,” said Dr. Joshua Black, senior statistical research scientist. “The main takeaway is that the disparity persists. Disparities have to be addressed all along that pathway in various ways that we can do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black said cultural context is key to outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We cited some other research in our study showing that with Hispanic groups, just taking something that was written for English and translating it to Spanish isn't enough, because the way that things are said needs to be culturally meaningful to that group,” he said. “Engaging with individuals who are part of the community, who are peers, would enable whatever is developed to resonate more effectively with that community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, stigma remains a major obstacle, not only in seeking help but in carrying naloxone. Black argues for new distribution strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So moving out of a healthcare out of a retail setting and having harm reduction present where people are, rather than having them come to where the medicine is, would be another way to get over the stigma," Black said. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A message of preparedness and hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Bender and Denver Health, the work goes well beyond emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's important to just be prepared and to really know how to use it and be prepared to use it,” Bender said. “In a crisis, it can feel a little jarring, and so it's good to have some repetitive practice… all those steps over and over, just to have it fresh in your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of peer support is also clear, especially for those experiencing these situations for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This just goes to show the value of people who have lived expertise and the role that they can play in helping folks that may not have experience with that know what to do in that situation,” Bender said. “We know these things are working, and we just need to expand access."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextModule"&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing recently in &lt;em&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/em&gt;, a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, the study found that patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer who consumed high levels of sucralose had worse response to immunotherapy and poorer survival than those with diets low in the artificial sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, supplements that boosted levels of the amino acid arginine mitigated the negative effects of sucralose on immunotherapy in mice, an approach that could now be tested in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's easy to say, 'Stop drinking diet soda,' but when patients are being treated for cancer, they are already dealing with enough, so asking them to drastically alter their diet may not be realistic," said lead author Abby Overacre, Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Immunology at Pitt and UPMC Hillman. "We need to meet patients where they are. That's why it's so exciting that arginine supplementation could be a simple approach to counteract the negative effects of sucralose on immunotherapy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author Diwakar Davar, M.D., associate professor of medicine at Pitt and a medical oncologist and hematologist at UPMC Hillman, collaborating with Overacre and their team, used mouse models to show that the negative impacts of sucralose are driven by disruption to gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sucralose shifted the composition of the mouse gut microbiome, increasing bacterial species that degrade arginine, which reduced levels of this amino acid in the blood, tumor fluid and stool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies such as anti-PD1 work by ramping up T cell activity so that they can more effectively kill cancer cells. Arginine is essential for T cell function, especially in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When arginine levels were depleted due to sucralose-driven shifts in the microbiome, T cells couldn't function properly," said Overacre. "As a result, immunotherapy wasn't as effective in mice that were fed sucralose."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse models of adenocarcinoma and melanoma, adding sucralose to the diet inhibited anti-PD1 therapy, leading to larger tumors and poorer survival. But when the researchers gave sucralose-fed mice arginine or citrulline, which is metabolized into arginine in the body, the effectiveness of immunotherapy was restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the relevance of these findings for humans, the researchers looked at 132 patients with advanced melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer who received anti-PD1 therapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Patients filled out detailed diet history questionnaires that included questions about how often they consumed artificial sweeteners in coffee, tea and diet soda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that sucralose impeded the effectiveness of immunotherapies across a range of cancer types, stages and treatment modalities," said Davar. "These observations raise the possibility of designing prebiotics, such as targeted nutrient supplementation for patients who consume high levels of sucralose."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope to launch a clinical trial investigating whether citrulline supplements -- which boost arginine levels more than arginine itself -- affect the gut microbiome and anti-tumor immune response in patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also interested in looking at how other sugar substitutes, such as aspartame, saccharin, xylitol and stevia, impact the immune system and response to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other authors on the study were Kristin Morder, M.S., Madison Nguyen, Drew Wilfahrt, Ph.D., Zakaria Dahmani, Ansen Burr, M.D., Ph.D., Bingxian Xie, Ph.D., Michael Morikone, Ph.D., Hector Nieves-Rosado, M.D., Ph.D., William Gunn, M.S., Drew Hurd, Hong Wang, Ph.D., Steven Mullett, Kaitlin Bossong, Stacy Gelhaus, Ph.D., Dhivyaa Rajasundaram, Ph.D., Lawrence Kane, Ph.D., and Greg Delgoffe, Ph.D., and Jishnu Das, Ph.D., all of Pitt or UPMC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there’s one I don’t like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 332 to 478 calories, while the lunches span 379 to 596 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="3"&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200-calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_125-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-health-benefits-of-a-high-protein-high-fiber-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_126-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Health Benefits of a High-Protein, High-Fiber Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_127-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is found in every cell in our body. Because of this, it’s essential for countless bodily functions like bone and muscle health, digestion and energy production. While most people get enough &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-youre-not-getting-enough-protein-11790921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, certain factors like activity level, age or health goals may amp up your needs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_128-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_129-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the flip side, diets that are too high in protein can sometimes lack fiber, which may lead to digestive troubles.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Striking the right balance of both protein and fiber is key to keeping your body healthy and running smoothly. Fiber brings its own powerful set of benefits. Diets rich in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to healthier weight loss and long-term weight control, a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, reduced odds of certain cancers, more regular bowel movements and even a longer life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_130-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_131-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Together, protein and fiber help you feel full and satisfied after meals, support digestion and keep your energy steady throughout the day. Talk about a winning combo for health and well-being! 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create EatingWell’s meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Five states reported local cases of animal and human bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease begins with "absent or mild and non-specific symptoms" like fevers, headaches, enlarged glands, muscle pain, and chest pain as the parasites flow through the bloodstream, per the&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt; World Health Organization's website&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, early symptoms could include "purplish swelling of the lids of one eye" or a skin lesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms get much more intense the longer the parasites remain in the body, largely collecting in the heart and digestive muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One to three decades after infection, up to a third of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 1 in 10 suffer from digestive (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon), neurological or mixed alterations," the website read. "In later years these patients may experience the damage to the nervous system and muscles of the heart and digestive system, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, progressive heart failure, and sudden death, among other clinical manifestations and complications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is treatable, but is much more effective in the early stages of infection. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212" target="_blank" title="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chagas-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356212" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, the disease may become untreatable if it becomes chronic, at which point the only option is treating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 18:44:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgJBVV95cUxQTE9vaWt6NE9CekVVOE4xLXdzSk85OHhoWFlvU0ZSZlNtZGNpQ0VubHplWm5uenNSTVltUmJSV3dvRVFVQ0ZCSElzWkZCdzlmT0FsQkZrNzlQRDFvS3FwMHZPSWFGeEpUMXA0RnNaMDFNX2tRaHV2a013NW5ydVc5VDZoc3N1Vm5hWFExZzdvVm1lUUFPNWFzOS1KQXRWLVUxenpERW4xV2hOVWJJaURoNmE1eXptbWRTN0pCbUdPbVljaExRb3VPRFUyMjFtemdfZzBDaDBudEVGdGVfN1lUV0tEbmpPVG9EMmthdnJRSjBONkhoWVR2NXpSM3ZsTlRlemZ0T2tDWmdITldmcUJkV0hNS195VjBZUUlNMjV6Y3Z0SUk4ZXM0YmVONTcwVE90OG8xSXpiTjI4THNYZkxESzg0cnRfSDAwRFBaVTJR</guid></item><item><title>如果您使用人工智能进行治疗，以下是专家推荐的5件事-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/06/ai-chatbots-therapy-tips/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JOLKNZK2FFHTJHJUGLV4KGUPPM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many people are turning to generative artificial intelligence for answers to work or school questions.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is everywhere these days. From bars to shakes to cereal, it seems every product is fortified with it.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just one 6-ounce container of plain, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-ingredient-for-high-protein-vegetarian-meals-8649419" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nonfat strained (Greek-style) yogurt&lt;/a&gt; packs 18 grams of high-quality protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This substantial amount of protein promotes feelings of fullness, reducing the likelihood of overeating later in the day,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/about-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD, CLEC, CPT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Protein works in several ways to help you lose weight. First, it increases satiety, or how full you feel when you eat. But that’s only the beginning. Protein requires lots of energy to digest and absorb. So, your body burns more calories to process protein-rich foods than carbohydrates or fats. Last but not least, protein also helps maintain calorie-burning muscle for a faster metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And there’s more. Strained (Greek-style) yogurt also contains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2053111/can-probiotics-help-you-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, live bacteria that support your gut and have also been linked to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And it boasts a robust nutrient profile (hello, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strained (Greek-style) yogurt is great for weight loss on its own. However, for an even more satisfying snack, dietitians recommend pairing it with fresh fruit and a healthy fat, like chopped nuts, seeds or a drizzle of nut butter. Try mixing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261071/yogurt-with-blueberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;yogurt with blueberries&lt;/a&gt; as an excellent base.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s certainly no shortage of options when it comes to strained (Greek-style) yogurt. However, nutrients can vary from brand to brand. Here’s what to look for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High in protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Choose brands that pack 16 grams or more of high-quality protein, says &lt;a href="https://enjoyfoodenjoylife.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Rodriguez, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low or no added sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Rodriguez recommends opting for a plain variety. However, if you’re an “on the fence” yogurt connoisseur, there are many brands with very low added sugar that may suit your taste. Stick to those with no more than 5 g of added sugar or less. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probiotics: &lt;/strong&gt;These are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;good-for-your-gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. For the best bang, look for &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;. Research reveals they may specifically help with weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll find them listed on the ingredient list. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little saturated fat: &lt;/strong&gt;Like protein, all fats aren’t created equally. For optimal heart health, the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting saturated fat to a maximum of 10% of total calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Rodriguez suggests choosing a brand that contains no more than 0.5 g of saturated fat per serving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-weight-loss-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips for Weight Loss Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Snacks that support weight loss should mimic the same composition as meals that support weight loss,” says Rodriguez. “They should be anchored with high-quality protein and rounded out with a naturally fibrous food and heart-healthy (plant-based) fat.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few other rules of thumb that can make your high-protein weight-loss snack work even harder for you:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; fills you up, so it may help you eat less.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, add some fiber-rich berries, pears or any of these other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-fiber-fruits-8639024" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-fiber fruits&lt;/a&gt; to your yogurt or smoothie. They’re also a great way to add natural sweetness. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean on healthy fats: &lt;/strong&gt;Fat is digested slowly, so it keeps you fuller for longer. Think &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-healthy-fats-for-weight-loss-8417296" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; from mix-ins like nuts, seeds, nut butters and even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/8057914/avocado-recipes-to-make-forever/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;avocados&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be choosy about allergy-friendly alternatives: &lt;/strong&gt;If dairy allergies are an issue, there are protein-rich plant-based strained (Greek-style) yogurt alternatives. Look for brands with at least 10 g of protein per serving. Just be cautious of the fat content, specifically saturated fat, which hangs out in coconut yogurt. Instead, opt for soy or oat-based yogurts fortified with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt;, like pea or soy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When weight loss is a goal, high-protein snacks can help you stay full and satisfied, especially strained (Greek-style) yogurt. It’s the top dietitian-approved high-protein snack to help you lose weight. Need help sifting through the plethora of options on store shelves? Look for one that’s low in saturated fat and added sugars. Or choose plain, unsweetened strained (Greek-style) yogurt and add your own healthy mix-ins like high-fiber fruits and a healthy fat, like chopped nuts. They’ll make your snack even more satisfying and delicious!&lt;br&gt;

The condition is generally diagnosed shortly after birth, as in Crews's case, but for some people, it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood, when a child's growth is not as expected for their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both her parents and two siblings are of average height, and like around 80 percent of children with achondroplasia, Crews inherited the condition due to a mutation in the FGFR3 gene that occurred at the time of conception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Growing up with achondroplasia was extremely difficult, Crews says, and she remembers her mother constantly fearing for her life as the condition can cause sudden death syndrome due to brainstem compression and dangerous breathing problems like sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her childhood was marred by frequent trips to hospitals for treatments and to meet with various specialists as dwarfism can cause complications, including bowed legs, spinal curvature, ear infections and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews also remembers feeling like a 'show dog' because of her small stature, and people would frequently come up to her to pat her head and give her 'fake' compliments to make her feel better, which she said left her feeling confused and angry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was when she turned 16 and realized she would never grow any taller that Crews decided to undergo 'taboo' limb lengthening surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Chandler Crews underwent three limb-lengthening procedures. Left, at her mature adult height of 3'10' and, right, at the end of her treatments, standing just over 4'11″ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limb lengthening is controversial in the dwarfism community because it's a painful, expensive, and risky procedure with a high complication rate, and some believe it promotes the idea that short stature is a defect to be 'fixed'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing on her website, Crews said: 'I felt like I was never in my own body. I felt like my energy was wasting time in the body it wasn't meant to be in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't want to wait for the world to change to fit my needs; I wanted to take charge and change for myself and no one else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've noticed within the dwarfism community, some may feel that when someone else with dwarfism changes or alters their own body, that it's an insult to everyone with that 'body type.' But it's not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just like everyone else in the world, our bodies are our own, and no one, even if you have the same diagnosis as them, should have any say in what you do or don't do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2010, when she was 16 years old, Crews underwent her first of three limb-lengthening procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leg lengthening for dwarfism or bow legs involves surgically cutting the thigh or shin bone and implanting a device (either an external fixator or internal rod) to slowly pull the bone segments apart over several weeks to months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bones are extended by around 1 millimeter per day, and during the 'distraction phase,' new bone forms in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the desired length is reached, the device is removed, and the new bone is left to fuse back together before the individual can regain full mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no precise, readily available national figures on the total number of limb lengthening surgeries performed annually in the US, but the procedure is performed for both dwarfism-related and cosmetic reasons, with cosmetic height-lengthening procedures increasing in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limb lengthening surgery in the US can be extremely expensive, and Crews estimates her procedures cost close to $2million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are fewer than 50,000 people with achondroplasia in the US. The condition is generally diagnosed shortly after birth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as she was told the surgeries were necessary to correct her bowed legs and improve her spine health, she was able to have them mostly paid for by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bow legs, also known as genu varum, is a condition where the knees curve outward, causing a gap between them when the feet are together. Left untreated, the long-term consequences of bowed legs in adults can include chronic joint pain, progressive arthritis, instability, and restricted mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews described the limb lengthening procedure as 'months of twists and turns' with a 'little blood, sweat, and tears.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The initial post-surgery recovery from her first surgery consisted of two to three hours of personal training sessions five days a week and daily exercises and stretches, which she did in her own time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time Crews' bones were in the right position for the fixators to be removed from her first leg lengthening surgery, it was April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'After removal, I had one month of no weight-bearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once I was cleared to fully weight-bear, I did have to re-learn how to walk, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used a walker for about two weeks, then two quad canes for about a week, then down to one. By June, I was walking unassisted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In August 2010, Crews underwent her first of three limb-lengthening procedures. Leg lengthening for dwarfism or bow legs involves surgically cutting the bone and implanting a device (either an external fixator or internal rod)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Crews described her first leg lengthening procedure as 'months of twists and turns' with a 'little blood, sweat, and tears'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After starting the process to get her legs lengthened, Crews also went about getting her arms lengthened so they would be in proportion with the rest of her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says people with dwarfism who opt to do leg lengthening usually opt to get their arms done too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Getting this procedure done, Crews points out, is important for a range of activities, from being able to drive a car to reaching into the refrigerator comfortably.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For her arm lengthening, Crews had fixators implanted in January 2012 when she was 17 years old and then removed the following August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said of the procedure: 'This time, I only had fixators on my humerus [the bone of the upper arm], which meant I was mobile [able to walk].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because you don't bear weight in your arms, the consolidation or fusing phase can be slower as weight-bearing tends to help bone consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As for the physical therapy, I did personal training two to three times a week. After removing my fixators, I had about a month of no heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The arm lengthening procedure saw Crews gain four inches in her arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews went in for a second and then third leg lengthening in May 2013 when she was 19 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, standing at just over 4'11″, the Marylander has been thrilled by the results of her operations. The average height for a woman varies globally, but in the US, it is 5'3.5".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says: 'In full transparency, I also wanted to be more able-bodied. It was not just about being taller but also more proportionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When it came to height (lengthening legs), I didn't want to rely on stepstools and other forms of assistance constantly. Yes, it was my 'norm,' but it never felt like independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Having longer arms, I can now reach the top of my head (wash it easier, high ponytails, safely use hairstyling tools, etc.), sit a safer distance away from the steering wheel when driving, not have to alter sleeves, deal with feminine hygiene – changing tampons, wiping front-to-back, not needing to use a bidet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At 4'11' I'm still really short, but I'm what I call (for myself) a "comfortable short."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to offer hope to other people coping with achondroplasia and similar conditions, Crews has set up a patient advocacy group called The Chandler Project (TCP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Limb lengthening surgery in the US can be extremely expensive, and Crew estimates her procedures cost close to $2million. However, as she was told the surgeries were necessary to correct her bowed legs and improve her health, she was able to claim them on insurance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Now standing at just over 4'11″, the Marylander has been thrilled by the results of her operations. In a bid to offer hope to other people coping with achondroplasia and similar conditions, Crews has set up a patient advocacy group called The Chandler Project (TCP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The organization aims to help drive awareness for new research and advancements surrounding pharmaceutical and surgical treatments and offer vital support resources to individuals and their families. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now happy with her help and living independently with less pain, Crews concludes: 'Everyone wants to feel normal, and that’s how I feel now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m honestly so tired of trying to make sure I don’t say ‘normal’ (because the word ‘normal’ is so frowned upon in the dwarfism community). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m not a little person, and inside I never felt like I was. I’ve never been a dwarf either. I’m just Chandler and I have achondroplasia. It’s a life-long medical diagnosis I will always deal with and fear of passing on to my future children.

The condition is generally diagnosed shortly after birth, as in Crews's case, but for some people, it may not be diagnosed until later in childhood, when a child's growth is not as expected for their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both her parents and two siblings are of average height, and like around 80 percent of children with achondroplasia, Crews inherited the condition due to a mutation in the FGFR3 gene that occurred at the time of conception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Growing up with achondroplasia was extremely difficult, Crews says, and she remembers her mother constantly fearing for her life as the condition can cause sudden death syndrome due to brainstem compression and dangerous breathing problems like sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her childhood was marred by frequent trips to hospitals for treatments and to meet with various specialists as dwarfism can cause complications, including bowed legs, spinal curvature, ear infections and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews also remembers feeling like a 'show dog' because of her small stature, and people would frequently come up to her to pat her head and give her 'fake' compliments to make her feel better, which she said left her feeling confused and angry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was when she turned 16 and realized she would never grow any taller that Crews decided to undergo 'taboo' limb lengthening surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Chandler Crews underwent three limb-lengthening procedures. Left, at her mature adult height of 3'10' and, right, at the end of her treatments, standing just over 4'11″ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limb lengthening is controversial in the dwarfism community because it's a painful, expensive, and risky procedure with a high complication rate, and some believe it promotes the idea that short stature is a defect to be 'fixed'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing on her website, Crews said: 'I felt like I was never in my own body. I felt like my energy was wasting time in the body it wasn't meant to be in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't want to wait for the world to change to fit my needs; I wanted to take charge and change for myself and no one else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've noticed within the dwarfism community, some may feel that when someone else with dwarfism changes or alters their own body, that it's an insult to everyone with that 'body type.' But it's not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just like everyone else in the world, our bodies are our own, and no one, even if you have the same diagnosis as them, should have any say in what you do or don't do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In August 2010, when she was 16 years old, Crews underwent her first of three limb-lengthening procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leg lengthening for dwarfism or bow legs involves surgically cutting the thigh or shin bone and implanting a device (either an external fixator or internal rod) to slowly pull the bone segments apart over several weeks to months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bones are extended by around 1 millimeter per day, and during the 'distraction phase,' new bone forms in the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the desired length is reached, the device is removed, and the new bone is left to fuse back together before the individual can regain full mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no precise, readily available national figures on the total number of limb lengthening surgeries performed annually in the US, but the procedure is performed for both dwarfism-related and cosmetic reasons, with cosmetic height-lengthening procedures increasing in popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Limb lengthening surgery in the US can be extremely expensive, and Crews estimates her procedures cost close to $2million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There are fewer than 50,000 people with achondroplasia in the US. The condition is generally diagnosed shortly after birth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as she was told the surgeries were necessary to correct her bowed legs and improve her spine health, she was able to have them mostly paid for by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bow legs, also known as genu varum, is a condition where the knees curve outward, causing a gap between them when the feet are together. Left untreated, the long-term consequences of bowed legs in adults can include chronic joint pain, progressive arthritis, instability, and restricted mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews described the limb lengthening procedure as 'months of twists and turns' with a 'little blood, sweat, and tears.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The initial post-surgery recovery from her first surgery consisted of two to three hours of personal training sessions five days a week and daily exercises and stretches, which she did in her own time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time Crews' bones were in the right position for the fixators to be removed from her first leg lengthening surgery, it was April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'After removal, I had one month of no weight-bearing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once I was cleared to fully weight-bear, I did have to re-learn how to walk, so to speak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used a walker for about two weeks, then two quad canes for about a week, then down to one. By June, I was walking unassisted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In August 2010, Crews underwent her first of three limb-lengthening procedures. Leg lengthening for dwarfism or bow legs involves surgically cutting the bone and implanting a device (either an external fixator or internal rod)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Crews described her first leg lengthening procedure as 'months of twists and turns' with a 'little blood, sweat, and tears'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After starting the process to get her legs lengthened, Crews also went about getting her arms lengthened so they would be in proportion with the rest of her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says people with dwarfism who opt to do leg lengthening usually opt to get their arms done too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Getting this procedure done, Crews points out, is important for a range of activities, from being able to drive a car to reaching into the refrigerator comfortably.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For her arm lengthening, Crews had fixators implanted in January 2012 when she was 17 years old and then removed the following August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said of the procedure: 'This time, I only had fixators on my humerus [the bone of the upper arm], which meant I was mobile [able to walk].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because you don't bear weight in your arms, the consolidation or fusing phase can be slower as weight-bearing tends to help bone consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As for the physical therapy, I did personal training two to three times a week. After removing my fixators, I had about a month of no heavy lifting, pushing, or pulling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The arm lengthening procedure saw Crews gain four inches in her arms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crews went in for a second and then third leg lengthening in May 2013 when she was 19 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, standing at just over 4'11″, the Marylander has been thrilled by the results of her operations. The average height for a woman varies globally, but in the US, it is 5'3.5".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She says: 'In full transparency, I also wanted to be more able-bodied. It was not just about being taller but also more proportionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When it came to height (lengthening legs), I didn't want to rely on stepstools and other forms of assistance constantly. Yes, it was my 'norm,' but it never felt like independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Having longer arms, I can now reach the top of my head (wash it easier, high ponytails, safely use hairstyling tools, etc.), sit a safer distance away from the steering wheel when driving, not have to alter sleeves, deal with feminine hygiene – changing tampons, wiping front-to-back, not needing to use a bidet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At 4'11' I'm still really short, but I'm what I call (for myself) a "comfortable short."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to offer hope to other people coping with achondroplasia and similar conditions, Crews has set up a patient advocacy group called The Chandler Project (TCP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Limb lengthening surgery in the US can be extremely expensive, and Crew estimates her procedures cost close to $2million. However, as she was told the surgeries were necessary to correct her bowed legs and improve her health, she was able to claim them on insurance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Now standing at just over 4'11″, the Marylander has been thrilled by the results of her operations. In a bid to offer hope to other people coping with achondroplasia and similar conditions, Crews has set up a patient advocacy group called The Chandler Project (TCP)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The organization aims to help drive awareness for new research and advancements surrounding pharmaceutical and surgical treatments and offer vital support resources to individuals and their families. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now happy with her help and living independently with less pain, Crews concludes: 'Everyone wants to feel normal, and that’s how I feel now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m honestly so tired of trying to make sure I don’t say ‘normal’ (because the word ‘normal’ is so frowned upon in the dwarfism community). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m not a little person, and inside I never felt like I was. I’ve never been a dwarf either. I’m just Chandler and I have achondroplasia. It’s a life-long medical diagnosis I will always deal with and fear of passing on to my future children.

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protein is having a moment. Walk the aisles at a grocery store and you'll see row upon row of protein chips, protein muffins, protein cereal, even protein candy bars. Entire industries are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/well/youbar-protein-bar-lab.html?campaign_id=9&amp;amp;emc=edit_nn_20250727&amp;amp;instance_id=159329&amp;amp;nl=the-morning&amp;amp;regi_id=271385713&amp;amp;segment_id=202697&amp;amp;user_id=37ce01b1037d31a80ca2ee6be0603584"&gt;emerging&lt;/a&gt; around the creation and processing of these novelty products. Processed protein is big business, and Americans are buying it: In a recent &lt;a href="https://ific.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, over 70 percent of Americans said they tried to increase their protein intake this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But American diets aren’t actually short on protein. They're short on &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/Pdf/0910/Table_1_Nin_Gen_09.Pdf"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and vitamins and minerals that come not from any one macronutrient but from a variety of natural, whole foods—things with leaves and skins and seeds—instead of the ultra-processed foods that make up the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/07/well/eat/americans-are-eating-slightly-less-ultraprocessed-food-cdc-data-shows.html"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of the average American’s diet. Indeed, the disconnect between Americans’ desires and their ideal diets is such that the latest version of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/new-us-dietary-guidelines-come-before-august-kennedy-says-2025-05-14/"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; as soon as August, is &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee-report-2025-11697882"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to emphasize the importance of protein—but from plant-based sources, over meat and dairy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we get here? A number of factors have contributed to the reign of protein as a health-food virtue-signal: the rise of Ozempic and doctors’ calls for GLP-1 drug users to eat more of it to keep up muscle tone, the influence of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement and its skepticism of ultra-processed products over whole foods, and above all, consumers’ desire to marry health (or the appearance of it) with convenience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last factor is the reason why, despite what Kennedy’s dietary guidelines may advise, the rise of protein consciousness seems unlikely to move the needle on the nutrition-related health crises—overweight and obesity, heart disease, diabetes—that plague the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/about/index.html"&gt;majority of Americans&lt;/a&gt;. Protein alone can't make America healthy again, but it's an enticing shortcut that more consumers are taking with every processed protein product—and most of them are very, very processed—that hits the shelves. To be able to recognize all this junk in health-food clothing, one first has to understand Americans’ love affair with fast food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text core-separator"&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall seemed to be the inflection point for protein. In August, Kennedy yoked his MAHA movement to the Trump presidential campaign, giving health-consciousness—and skepticism of anything considered “unhealthy”—an energized platform beyond social media and the doctor’s office. The new class of weight-loss drugs—that is, Ozempic and its fellows—had also been approved by the FDA. By September the market was ripe for a new kind of convenience food, and that's when Nestlé, the world’s largest food company, &lt;a href="https://www.nestleusa.com/media/pressreleases/vital-pursuit-nationwide-glp-1"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a new line of high-protein frozen meals targeted at weight-loss drug users. Grouped under the brand name Vital Pursuit, the meals are marketed as the perfect convenience food for newly health-conscious consumers: The cauliflower crust pepperoni pizza packs 22 grams of protein for under 400 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pizza tastes like a cardboard prototype of a pizza. Measuring just over six inches in diameter, made with that trendy cauliflower crust and topped with reduced-fat mozzarella cheese, it’s “air fryer ready . . . for added convenience.” The pie I unwrapped from its plastic boasted a grand total of four pepperoni, a shockingly orange sauce, and a nifty kind of topping formulation that popped off the crust in a single disk when accidentally knocked against the baking sheet. It is convenient, yes, but it does not look healthy. Nor does it taste that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did taste, however, much like every frozen pizza I’d eaten in my childhood: a monoflavor vaguely reminiscent of tomato, cheese, and flour—and strongly reminiscent of Friday nights, when my family and I ate frozen pizzas and watched Disney movies. This rush of nostalgia made me realize something that Nestlé knows well: When it comes to food, the important thing is how one feels about it. And if consumers now want to feel healthy while indulging in ultra-processed foods—well, just add protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is a wolf in sheep’s clothing that Americans should recognize by now. While the term “junk food” has been around for a long time, figuring out what exactly is wrong with it is a recent, and quite popular, endeavor. Dieting took off in the late 1800s and ultra-processed foods began to appear early in the next century, but American obesity rates started rising at a steep rate in the 1970s as fast food and convenience meals—and the advertising of them—really took off. The theories about the reasons behind this nationwide weight gain are many, and many have a grain of truth: too few fruits and vegetables, sedentary lifestyles, poverty, food deserts. As the problem continues to worsen, people point fingers in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main thread that unites all of these complex causes is the idea that Americans &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to lose weight—through diets, programs, drugs, apps, and more—and then they confront reality in the form of a fast-food sign. The idea that our diets are a problem really gripped the nation with the 2001 publication of Eric Schlosser’s hit book &lt;em&gt;Fast Food Nation&lt;/em&gt;, which argued that quintessential American restaurants aggressively marketed food that they knew was unhealthy—especially to children, to get them hooked for life. The investigative reporter Michael Moss expanded this idea to all processed food in a popular 2013 exposé, claiming that companies formulate their products to hit the “&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130401012639/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html?pagewanted=4"&gt;bliss point&lt;/a&gt;”—that is, the irresistible combination of salt, sugar, and fat that keeps customers coming back for more, presumably forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before MAHA, then, Americans were hearing the claim that junk food was intrinsically addictive because of what’s in it. But as fast food companies responded to the backlash by &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/sodium-still-high-in-fast-food-and-processed-foods-201305166267"&gt;promising to lower&lt;/a&gt; fat and salt content over the next few years, some researchers noticed something odd: Americans’ weight wasn’t decreasing, and neither was their consumption of fast and fatty foods—in fact, the opposite was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And some researchers couldn’t help but wonder whether it wasn’t so much the ingredients of foods, but the way these ingredients were treated by food manufacturers. Chris van Tulleken’s 2023 book &lt;em&gt;Ultraprocessed People &lt;/em&gt;argued that the processing itself—the stripping or “refining” of flours, the “isolating” of proteins and “hydrolyzing” of fats—makes what was once food into something that the body can’t digest. He, along with many other medical professionals, claimed that eating ultra-processed food leads to diseases like those linked to obesity: Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, metabolic syndrome. And the food industry essentially regulates itself thanks to loopholes such as the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) designation, which essentially allows companies to self-determine whether a new ingredient is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to protein. By these criteria, Vital Pursuit pepperoni cauliflower crust protein pizza—and many of its fellow protein-packed processed foods—is simply a newer member of an older food category, one that is simultaneously “health food” and junk. Nestlé’s strategy seems based on the bet that consumers won’t see the contradiction here—and if they do, habit and nostalgia will win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text core-separator"&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nestlé isn’t the only company that is trying to enter the protein-conscious era, nor is it the first. The protein-pumping trend appeared in nutrition and workout circles for years before weight loss drugs and MAHA took it fully mainstream. Core Power protein shakes, owned by Fairlife and distributed by Coca-Cola, launched in 2012 and in recent years has &lt;a href="https://mattbruenig.com/2023/05/06/fairlife-refuses-to-inflate-prices/#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20very%20popular,at%20retailers%20across%20the%20country"&gt;inspired a mania&lt;/a&gt; reminiscent of the COVID toilet paper hoarding days. Predictably, Fairlife’s viral fame led to empty Costco shelves—and Fairlife is &lt;a href="https://www.environmentenergyleader.com/stories/coca-colas-fairlife-breaks-ground-on-major-production-facility-in-ny,1187#:~:text=This%20expansion%20follows%20the%20construction,growing%20demand%20for%20fairlife%20products."&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; new facilities to ramp up production, while members of weight loss drug support groups on social media continue to tout them as a “healthy” meal replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the Nestlé pizzas, though, the list of ingredients on a Core Power shake includes plenty of evidence of processing. The natural sugar and fat in the milk is replaced with plant-based additives that imitate the texture and flavor of a sugary milkshake, in a way that makes the nutrition label look “healthier.” Core Power shakes use the thickening agent carrageenan to give that impression of milky creaminess, the emulsifier cellulose gel to replace fat, and cellulose gum for texture and consistency. The shakes’ sweetness comes from a mix of the “natural” plant-based sweeteners Stevia and monkfruit, along with the artificial sweeteners acesulfame potassium and sucralose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there is the type of protein itself in these “healthy” products. Fairlife protein shakes use ultra-filtered milk, which is processed to increase protein content and reduce lactose, the natural sugar in dairy products. But some “healthy” products use even more highly processed, and questionable, sources of protein. One popular type of protein bar (among the infinite profusion of options) for those on weight loss drugs, according to an informal survey of posts in a Facebook support group, is made by Barebells. It’s a Swedish company that launched in 2016—and is notably not owned by a mega-food corporation—that offers the full range of imitation dessert flavors from cookie dough to caramel chocolate to key lime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barebells uses a “milk protein blend” that includes calcium caseinate and whey protein isolate, hydrolyzed bovine collagen, whey protein isolate. Behind all these terms is, again, lots of processing: Whey protein can be packaged into any flavor of protein bar one can dream of. Soy often appears on nutrition labels as an “isolate,” which is blasted with chemicals to “purify” it for easy use in all sorts of protein boosters, from pizza to those muscled-up pseudo-Pop-Tarts in checkout aisles from GNC to CVS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, a food company adding protein to a nutritionally empty product is better than nothing. But despite what the protein craze suggests, pumped-up protein does not put consumers on the fast-track to health. Indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/well/eat/protein-fact-check.html?campaign_id=9&amp;amp;emc=edit_nn_20250727&amp;amp;instance_id=159329&amp;amp;nl=the-morning&amp;amp;regi_id=271385713&amp;amp;segment_id=202697&amp;amp;user_id=37ce01b1037d31a80ca2ee6be0603584"&gt;nutritionists&lt;/a&gt; are increasingly warning that overloading on protein can backfire: The body can only make use of a certain amount of protein for energy before the body starts storing it as fat, and overdoses of certain amino acids, which combine to form proteins, can &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/protein-food-industry-trend-nutrition-8a2cf27b?st=v91RFw"&gt;lead&lt;/a&gt; to cardiovascular disease. And for weight-loss drug users, the drugs’ appetite-suppressing effects actually mean that consuming a variety of foods matters even more in order to get necessary nutrients with fewer calories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching nutrients to cut calorie, carb, and fat counts doesn’t seem to magically create healthy food, despite food companies’ claims to the contrary. But when criticisms arise, the ultra-processed food industry’s go-to tactic consists of “reformulation”: changing recipes by using different materials such as starches or flavorings to provide the “same great taste!” W.K. Kellogg Co. followed this strategy after the U.K.’s High Fat Sugar Salt (HFSS) regulations went into effect in 2022, placing limits on how and where foods high in these common markers of junk food could be marketed. In response, the company &lt;a href="https://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Article/2023/06/07/kellogg-s-expands-non-hfss-coco-pops-range#"&gt;rolled out&lt;/a&gt; an additional, “non-HFSS” version of its most popular offering among children, Coco Pops, with marginally lower sugar content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode shows that regulation can certainly be done. But it can also blur the already gray line between what’s healthy and what’s not. After all, the non-HFSS Coco Pops are by law a healthy choice now—something even the most ambitious cereal marketer would have had a hard time convincing even the most persuadable mother about before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with Kennedy asking food companies to make a “&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-applauds-dairy-industry-voluntary-commitment-food-dyes.html"&gt;voluntary, protective pledge&lt;/a&gt;” to remove additives such as food dyes from their products, this dynamic could well play out in the United States, in ways that could blur the lines of healthy food even more—and reinforce old habits. After all, no matter how many people are on Ozempic, Americans aren’t going to stop eating nachos during the Super Bowl. Food marketers know well the power of nostalgia in determining what consumers will crave: The Coco Pops you ate for breakfast or the Doritos you ate while watching football as a kid might be what you crave now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the magic of modern food processing is that both cereal and chips can be adapted, at least on their face, to nutritional requirements. This ambiguity favors large food companies, which have far greater resources to make over their established brands than an organic farmer does. And that’s not even counting the time it takes for scientists and regulators to catch up. Travis Masterson, who directs the Health, Ingestive Behavior, and Technology lab at Penn State, described watching Nestlé and other food companies respond to the rise of the new weight loss drugs from inside the scientific community: “Those companies are doing massive amounts of market research on their consumers all the time,” he said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“If as scientists we're starting to look at the changes in diet, they're light years ahead of us on that because they can do things faster and easier than we can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Kennedy may be behind the times in the fight to Make America Healthy Again through &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf"&gt;cutting ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. In the age of Ozempic and MAHA, the centrality of ultra-processed food to Americans’ diet seems less under threat than undergoing a new stage of evolution—a protein-packed one. We say we want to eat better, but what we really want is to feel better about eating. And food companies, unbridled by any powerful regulation, are primed to give us what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;

It functions as a cofactor for over 300 enzyme systems that control a variety of biochemical reactions within the body, such as some of protein synthesis, to support muscle and nervous function, and also to control the structural growth of bone in the body. Magnesium is often referred to as a "calming mineral"; it has a role in the regulation of neurotransmitters and synaptic plasticity, an adaptation required for learning and unclouded memory. The dark leafy greens contain the highest levels of magnesium, along with nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains.&lt;br&gt;If a person has a very low level of magnesium within the body, then they are likely to suffer from anxiety, insomnia and even depression as clinical findings indicate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 14:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>睡觉时“大脑清洁”如何降低痴呆症的风险- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-brain-dementia.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain has its own waste disposal system—known as the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00031.2020" target="_blank"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;—that's thought to be more active when we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;But disrupted sleep might hinder this &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/waste/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;waste&lt;/a&gt; disposal system and slow the clearance of waste products or toxins from the brain. And &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb8739" target="_blank"&gt;researchers are proposing&lt;/a&gt; a build-up of these toxins due to lost sleep could increase someone's risk of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still some debate about how this glymphatic system works in humans, with most research so far in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it raises the possibility that better sleep might boost clearance of these toxins from the human brain and so reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what we know so far about this emerging area of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why waste matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cells in the body create waste. Outside the brain, the lymphatic system carries this waste from the spaces between cells to the blood via a network of lymphatic vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the brain has no lymphatic vessels. And until about 12 years ago, how the brain clears its waste was a mystery. That's when scientists discovered the "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1592-13.2013" target="_blank"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;" and described how it "flushes out" brain toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cerebrospinal-fluid" target="_blank"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;, the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This fluid flows in the areas surrounding the brain's blood vessels. It then enters the spaces between the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt;, collecting waste, then carries it out of the brain via large draining veins.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Scientists then showed in mice that this glymphatic system was most active—with increased flushing of waste products—&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1241224" target="_blank"&gt;during sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such waste product is amyloid beta (Aβ) protein. Aβ that accumulates in the brain can form clumps called plaques. These, along with tangles of tau protein found in neurons (brain cells), are a hallmark of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-the-difference-between-alzheimers-and-dementia-225271" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer's disease, the most common type of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans and mice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1180962" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that levels of Aβ detected in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cerebrospinal+fluid/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; increase when awake and then rapidly fall during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01638-y" target="_blank"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; (in mice) showed pretty much the opposite—suggesting the glymphatic system is more active in the daytime. Researchers are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01897-3" target="_blank"&gt;debating&lt;/a&gt; what might explain the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we still have some way to go before we can say exactly how the glymphatic system works—in mice or humans—to clear the brain of toxins that might otherwise increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Does this happen in humans too?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know sleeping well is good for us, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.55" target="_blank"&gt;particularly our brain health&lt;/a&gt;. We are all aware of the short-term effects of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep+deprivation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; on our brain's ability to function, and we know &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00054.2024" target="_blank"&gt;sleep helps improve memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, a single night of complete sleep deprivation in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1721694115" target="_blank"&gt;increased the amount&lt;/a&gt; of Aβ in the hippocampus, an area of the brain implicated in Alzheimer's disease. This suggests sleep can influence the clearance of Aβ from the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt;, supporting the idea that the human glymphatic system is more active while we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also raises the question of whether good sleep might lead to better clearance of toxins such as Aβ from the brain, and so be a potential target to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How about sleep apnea or insomnia?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is less clear is what long-term disrupted sleep, for instance if someone has a sleep disorder, means for the body's ability to clear Aβ from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/obstructive-sleep-apnoea" target="_blank"&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; is a common sleep disorder when someone's breathing stops multiple times as they sleep. This can lead to chronic (long-term) sleep deprivation, and reduced oxygen in the blood. Both may be implicated in the accumulation of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea has also been linked with an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13589" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. And we now know that after people are treated for sleep apnea &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsx011" target="_blank"&gt;more Aβ is cleared from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/insomnia-2" target="_blank"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt; is when someone has difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. When this happens in the long term, there's also an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318814" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, we don't know the effect of treating insomnia on toxins associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, it's still too early to say for sure that treating a sleep disorder reduces your risk of dementia because of reduced levels of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these studies suggest enough good quality sleep is important for a healthy brain, and in particular for clearing toxins associated with dementia from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still don't know if &lt;i&gt;treating&lt;/i&gt; a sleep disorder or improving sleep more broadly affects the brain's ability to remove toxins, and whether this reduces the risk of dementia. It's an area researchers, including us, are actively working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we're investigating the &lt;a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/projects/understanding-brain-cleaning-in-obstructive-sleep-apnoea" target="_blank"&gt;concentration of Aβ and tau measured in blood&lt;/a&gt; across the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle in people with sleep apnea, on and off treatment, to better understand how sleep apnea affects brain cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into the potential for treating insomnia with a class of drugs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44323-025-00025-5" target="_blank"&gt;known as orexin receptor antagonists&lt;/a&gt; to see if this affects the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06823752" target="_blank"&gt;clearance of Aβ from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you're concerned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an emerging field and we don't yet have all the answers about the link between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-dangerous-is-insomnia-how-fear-of-what-its-doing-to-your-body-can-wreck-your-sleep-212248" target="_blank"&gt;disrupted sleep and dementia&lt;/a&gt;, or whether better sleep can boost the glymphatic system and so prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are concerned about your sleep or cognition, please see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

The Trump ally has repeatedly warned—against all accepted scientific evidence—that COVID mRNA vaccines may be driving a “cancer signal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;One of the studies Malhotra and Hatfill cite is a 2025 paper by Paul Marik and Justus Hope, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Independent Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, titled ‘&lt;a href="https://discovery.researcher.life/article/covid-19-mrna-induced-turbo-cancers/e42d11c02d623e549ed2e837f7fb9e3b" rel=""&gt;COVID-19 mRNA-Induced “Turbo Cancers.”&lt;/a&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;However, oncology and vaccine-safety experts say the review assembles anecdotes and speculative mechanisms but doesn’t produce population-level evidence that COVID mRNA vaccines cause or accelerate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the early days of the pandemic, Hatfill also vigorously championed treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine, despite multiple studies and the FDA saying the drug provided no meaningful clinical benefit and could actually cause people harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item b-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="A close-up of former Army Scientist Steven Hatfill speaking to reporters in 2011." class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=800" srcset="https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=274 274w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=400 400w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=768 768w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=1024 1024w, https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/E342RLAOZ5CHBHKFABHULYIZ2Q.jpg?auth=f588452688e4fb5498573febc3c0ef5f7876d7f122587473249e71754be0e5ae&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=1440 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;HHS advisor Steven Hatfill has made various claims debunked by science, including that COVD vaccines could lead to cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;Michael Williamson/The Washington Post via Getty Images &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dalgliesh, emeritus professor of oncology at the University of London, has also publicly alleged mRNA boosters can drive rapid cancer progression. Dalgleish’s beliefs have been repeatedly debunked among the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month, Malhotra told the Daily Beast that RFK Jr. and Trump—having already made the COVID mRNA vaccine available only to the medically vulnerable and over-65s—were planning to pull it off the market altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Malhotra says there are people within the Trump administration, as well as among Trump’s family, who agree with RFK Jr. that there are so-called “injuries” caused by the vaccine. Kennedy and the Trump associates do not have any medical qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Days after the Daily Beast revealed plans to pull the vaccine, a wave of CDC departures occurred over Kennedy’s vaccine policy. Trump then publicly called on drug companies to prove that their COVID jabs worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Daily Beast approached Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, the HHS, and Dalgliesh for comment. Dalgliesh said: “[While] we do not know that Charles and Kate’s unexpected cancers were caused by the vaccines, as they both presented with benign conditions… it is highly likely.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;White House spokesman Kush Desai said: “This individual is not a member of the Administration, and does not represent the Administration’s thinking or planning. The Daily Beast should expend its obviously limited capabilities on trying to accurately cover the people who actually can speak on behalf of the Administration.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 13:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNN2VaTGx0ZUxNWjRFckNtNnRyMlFNclM1dzNUeVRQVE5GUUo5b3FKLXZaME1yMEI2NHpWNW9qenlpeVNJeG9kSjhfdkpHX2NVS09BYWV0MXRJUTk1Y0hLOTRmN1BQalBJTlZmeW5vS0xhSWt5WTZYUm96eGVvaE9QR1U4X01qaVdoX3FpckNiS29YZEJDZi0xZURmWmUxQ0ZnbnRSSUh3RGZnNUp5U05PM0xONnR3OGlTQU8xZmFDb0x2VW41V3F6cFZxaXAyQ204dG9B</guid></item><item><title>为什么一些俄勒冈人因接种COVID-19疫苗而被拒之门外- OregonLive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/09/why-some-oregonians-are-being-turned-away-for-covid-19-vaccines.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EK2EOJNGOJDI5EP6CQ4SXC74TE"&gt;Some Oregonians — including older residents and those with health conditions — who have tried to get the latest COVID-19 vaccine at a local pharmacy are being told they need a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4WSLLVAHSVDMLFTUY55YJERZ7Q"&gt;Why the sudden change?

The Trump ally has repeatedly warned—against all accepted scientific evidence—that COVID mRNA vaccines may be driving a “cancer signal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the studies Malhotra and Hatfill cite is a 2025 paper by Paul Marik and Justus Hope, published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Independent Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, titled ‘&lt;a href="https://discovery.researcher.life/article/covid-19-mrna-induced-turbo-cancers/e42d11c02d623e549ed2e837f7fb9e3b" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID-19 mRNA-Induced “Turbo Cancers.”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;COVID-19 mRNA-Induced “Turbo Cancers.”&lt;/a&gt;’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, oncology and vaccine-safety experts say the review assembles anecdotes and speculative mechanisms but doesn’t produce population-level evidence that COVID mRNA vaccines cause or accelerate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the early days of the pandemic, Hatfill also vigorously championed treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine, despite multiple studies and the FDA saying the drug provided no meaningful clinical benefit and could actually cause people harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS advisor Steven Hatfill has made various claims debunked by science, including that COVD vaccines could lead to cancer. / Michael Williamson/The Washington Post via Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dalgliesh, emeritus professor of oncology at the University of London, has also publicly alleged mRNA boosters can drive rapid cancer progression. Dalgleish’s beliefs have been repeatedly debunked among the medical community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Last month, Malhotra told the Daily Beast that RFK Jr. and Trump—having already made the COVID mRNA vaccine available only to the medically vulnerable and over-65s—were planning to pull it off the market altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Malhotra says there are people within the Trump administration, as well as among Trump’s family, who agree with RFK Jr. that there are so-called “injuries” caused by the vaccine. Kennedy and the Trump associates do not have any medical qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Days after the Daily Beast revealed plans to pull the vaccine, a wave of CDC departures occurred over Kennedy’s vaccine policy. Trump then publicly called on drug companies to prove that their COVID jabs worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Daily Beast approached Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, the HHS, and Dalgliesh for comment. Dalgliesh said: “[While] we do not know that Charles and Kate’s unexpected cancers were caused by the vaccines, as they both presented with benign conditions… it is highly likely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;White House spokesman Kush Desai said: “This individual is not a member of the Administration, and does not represent the Administration’s thinking or planning. The Daily Beast should expend its obviously limited capabilities on trying to accurately cover the people who actually can speak on behalf of the Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 12:56:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPbWFrOUpMLVRRWXRUeTBlVmdzd3F6M3k1dkpNQjZoSks3ZnR0b2ZGOEhNaWNkWWdvaG1id3dBYXBuQlFrMUNKTGE4aWpZSlRidFRlRWdzSmRyQ3kwd3lUNlUzeWNLSDhTS3RDejduVXdtVU5kUkxORWN5WmxWNE1tVDZEcHo</guid></item><item><title>卡通：医疗急救-科斯日报</title><link>https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/9/6/2341863/-Cartoon-Medical-emergency</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__details"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Jonny Terrell was a healthy, happy baby — but a month before his first birthday, he came down with an infection. Days later, he was vomiting. Over the next few weeks, mom Emily Robichau took him to the doctor for ear infections, stomachaches, rashes, vomiting, diarrhea and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The list was so long I couldn't remember it all," Robichau recalled. She had three older children and knew that kids got sick. But she had never seen anything like the constant stream of ailments her 11-month-old was experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day after Jonny's first birthday, in August 2024, his stomach swelled, "like watching a balloon fully inflate," Robichau said. The next day was his one-year checkup. Jonny's pediatrician took one look at him and sent them to Massachusetts General Hospital for Children. When Robichau and Jonny arrived, the toddler underwent CT and MRI scans that found a mass "about the size of a grapefruit" in his liver. A biopsy of the mass found that he had a rare and aggressive cancer called malignant rhabdoid tumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robichau said she and her fiancé, Michael Terrell, began "looking at urns" as they learned more about the condition.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Doctors were telling me the statistics and how bad they were, and to hope for the best, but kind of prepare for the worst," Robichau recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is malignant rhabdoid tumor? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malignant rhabdoid tumor is a rare tumor, most often seen in infants and toddlers, said Dr. Michael Ortiz, a pediatric oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the clinical director of the rare tumors program at MSK Kids, the center's pediatric arm. Ortiz was not involved in Jonny's care. Just 20 to 25 patients are diagnosed with the illness each year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions/malignant-rhabdoid-tumor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Boston Children's Hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tumors can "show up anywhere" in the body's soft tissues, but "have a predilection for the brain and kidney," Ortiz said. The tumors also have a "high propensity to metastasize," or spread, throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malignant rhabdoid tumors are "one of the worst prognostic tumors we have in pediatrics," Ortiz said. Only about one in 10 children with the diagnosis will be cured, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Treating malignant rhabdoid tumor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Jonny, his case was a rare example where the tumor had not spread, said Dr. Lauren Boal, a pediatric oncologist and hematologist at Massachusetts General. She and Dr. Danielle Cameron, a pediatric surgeon with a focus on tumors like this, developed a complex treatment plan for Jonny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This disease really doesn't have an absolute regimen. You have to carve out an individualized plan," Boal said. For Jonny, that meant a course of six chemotherapy agents. He responded well, though he suffered unpleasant side effects from the powerful medications, Boal said, and needed a feeding tube to eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that period, Robichau and Jonny lived in housing across the street from the hospital. It was stressful to live apart from the rest of the family, but Jonny's rigid treatment plan and its side effects made it necessary to stay close. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We all experienced the same trauma in different ways," Robichau said. "I feel like I just went on autopilot. It was lonely, it was quiet. It just had us overwhelmed, anxious, scared, financially struggling, big time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once chemotherapy shrank the tumor to about half its original size, Cameron surgically removed the mass. The operation was followed by radiation treatment. Despite the difficult circumstances, Jonny was an "amazing" patient, Cameron said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have vivid memories of him just going around the unit in his little red wagon and playing, constantly laughing," Cameron said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't really take anything for granted"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now just over 2 years old, Jonny is "in remission but undergoing careful surveillance," Cameron said. He will undergo frequent scans to ensure the tumor does not return, Boal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Often the higher and highest risk time to have a relapse of this very difficult disease is in the first year or two after you complete your chemotherapy," Boal said. "We are watching him very closely, but very hopeful that he will not have a recurrence of this." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ortiz said that children who survive malignant rhabdoid tumor often see later-in-life side effects, including an increased risk for developing a second form of cancer. Jonny will also recieve IV antibiotics monthly for the next few months to keep infections from taking advantage of his compromised immune system, caused by the chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robichau said she worries for Jonny's future, but is just trying to enjoy the current moment. He had his chemotherapy port removed, and the family recently began getting rid of the medical supplies they had acquired during Jonny's treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We still live minute by minute, day by day, week by week, as much as we can soak up every moment," she said. "After that kind of experience, we don't really take anything for granted anymore." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An emotional birthday&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Robichau and Terrell, the end of August was an emotional time time. Less than a year ago, she had been told to expect the worst. But this summer, the family was able to focus on planning Jonny's second birthday party. The event overlapped with the couple's twins' birthday, and meant they could turn what had been a traumatic day into a celebratory one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It all happened around this time," Robichau said. "We had the party on the twins' birthday, because that was the day he left (for the hospital). So we want to change that a little bit." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after the party, Jonny saw Boal at Mass General Hospital to ensure the cancer was still in remission. His scans were clear, Boal said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When CBS News spoke to Robichau, Jonny could be heard chattering in the background. Terrell said he was "running around like nothing happened." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's becoming more and more real," Robichau said. "It's been a long, long year. We're just transitioning to our new normal." &lt;/p&gt;
