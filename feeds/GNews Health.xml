Sitting on an open bowl offers no support for the pelvic floor. That puts pressure on veins in the rectum, making them swollen and inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2948d1" class="body-graf"&gt;“The longer you sit on the toilet, the worse it is for you,” said Dr. Trisha Pasricha, director of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center’s Institute for Gut-Brain Research Institute in Boston. Pasricha is also an author of the study, which was &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0329983&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday in PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d81198" class="body-graf"&gt;And smartphones are designed to keep people fixated for as long as possible. “They’re completely consuming to us in ways that wasn’t happening to the casual bathroom reader in the 80s,” Pasricha said. “They could much more easily put the newspaper down and get up and leave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9617e" class="body-graf"&gt;Pasricha and colleagues surveyed 125 adults just before they were about to have a routine colonoscopy to screen for colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-52fe29" class="body-graf"&gt;Eighty-three (66%) of the participants admitted to using their phones in the bathroom — mostly to catch up on news of the day and scroll through social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-525b28" class="body-graf"&gt;Gastroenterologists performing the colonoscopies looked for evidence of inflamed veins, or hemorrhoids. People who said they took their phone into the bathroom were 46% more likely to have hemorrhoids compared to the others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d0d65" class="body-graf"&gt;The risk remained even when researchers accounted for other factors associated with hemorrhoids, including dietary fiber, exercise and constipation or straining while using the toilet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf00d2" class="body-graf"&gt;Hemorrhoids aren’t necessarily dangerous, but they can be bothersome, itchy and even painful. They also bleed sometimes, understandably causing concern and leading to nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(18)30275-1/fulltext/" target="_blank"&gt;4 million doctor’s office and emergency department visits&lt;/a&gt; a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-294985" class="body-graf"&gt;Over time, “pelvic floor dysfunction can also lead to incontinence, worsen constipation and be associated with rectal pain,” said Dr. Reezwana Chowdhury, an inflammatory bowel disorder specialist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Chowdhury was not involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc3395" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, microscopic particles from urine and feces are sent flying through the air when a toilet is flushed. Taking a phone into the bathroom, Chowdhury said, “is kind of gross.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-8a61c3" class="body-heading"&gt;Younger patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7c2ae" class="body-graf"&gt;In the new study, smartphone users in the bathroom tended to be younger, meaning adults in their 40s and 50s, versus people over age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca875c" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Robert Cima, a colorectal surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said he’s noticed an uptick in recent years of people coming in with hemorrhoids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ff0ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“I am seeing younger, earlier- and middle-aged people having more hemorrhoidal complaints, but I can’t tie it to smartphones,” said Cima, who was not involved with the new study. “Maybe it’s because they’re using smartphones or they have better access to care or they’re not eating appropriately.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3b112d" class="body-heading"&gt;The 5-minute rule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-400844" class="body-graf"&gt;The experts agreed that business on the toilet should take no longer than 5 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-866a13" class="body-graf"&gt;More than 37% of study participants who used a smartphone in the bathroom stayed for longer than that, compared to 7% of people who kept their phones out of the bathroom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57bffb" class="body-graf"&gt;Pasricha and other experts do not advocate for taking a phone into the bathroom. If you absolutely must, set a timer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b09651" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If the magic is not happening within five minutes, it’s not going to happen,” Pasricha said. “Take a breather and try again later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 18:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMzJsdnMxT1haOU1IRWlMOVZJVTh3MjJTeDVHVFYtQVJaSG1Pb3l5eU14RWhoVkpVT2lwWWIwVmZmNVlLWk9KQ1NRbkhTYVlYbC1zRzY0OHRyUU5NMVNnMXJRbjY1YTROUzhHc2JoNE15bzdxWUdFUVdUeUtwRURkVndRUWZSOHRqUUphZ1Q3c1F5aFRGT2FINnRGXy1Md19EOEE4SzRycjdmWHPSAVZBVV95cUxPbGhFcDExa2NickRIVEoya1pTc3ZpeDZYdTVIUWdBanZRaWxZWWd1WWxKSzN2a2FlejZucmtYVXhocVJlWUlia1dXOVF0TE1aTHF2cXU2QQ</guid></item><item><title>您没有睡觉，导致失眠恶化的五件事- Gazeta Express</title><link>https://www.gazetaexpress.com/en/You%27re-not-sleeping--five-things-that-are-making-your-insomnia-worse/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content"&gt;

&lt;p class="gt-block"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you're a victim of sleep disorder, you might be in luck—an expert may have solved the mystery of why you can't sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep scientists have long suggested banning technology before bed, avoiding caffeine, and sticking to a fixed schedule every night as three simple ways to combat insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But now, a sleep researcher at Royal Holloway University of London has claimed that these are not the most effective ways to get enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Kirsty Vant, five common habits can make insomnia even worse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When sleep doesn't come, the temptation is to go to bed earlier or stay up longer in the morning to "compensate."&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“But this strategy often backfires,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The more time you spend awake in bed, the more you weaken the mental association between bed and sleep—and strengthen the association between bed and frustration,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, people should go to bed a little later and wake up at the same time every morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This strengthens sleep pressure—the body’s natural desire for sleep—and reframes bed as a signal for sleep, not wakefulness,” she told The Conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2867041" srcset="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1.jpg 798w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-437x300.jpg 437w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-768x527.jpg 768w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-1-184x126.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, scientists often advise avoiding screens before bed because the blue light they emit suppresses melatonin—a natural hormone that plays a key role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This type of lighting can create strong contrasts and shadows, which are tiring to the eyes, they argue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the evening, it can signal to your body that it's still time to be alert, disrupting the natural calming process and contributing to physical and mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, “lying in the dark with nothing to engage your mind can create the perfect storm for anxiety and overthinking, both of which fuel insomnia,” Ms. Vant said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of banning screens altogether, use them strategically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choose calming, non-stimulating content, use 'night mode' options, and avoid mindlessly scrolling through pages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if people are sensitive to caffeine, it is "wise" to avoid it later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Removing it completely “is not always necessary,” she advised. “Understanding your individual response is key.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a recent sleep survey, around one in nine women in the UK—approximately 4.5 million—use a sleep/health app or device, such as a smartwatch, to track their sleep habits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sleep pattern is presented in the app with diagrams showing minutes spent in the three stages of sleep—light, deep, and REM—with warnings if users don't reach their target hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the “overwhelming effort to optimize sleep” is fueling rising cases of insomnia and orthosomnia—the obsession with sleeping “right,” Ms. Vant said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2867042" srcset="https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2.jpg 793w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-499x300.jpg 499w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-600x360.jpg 600w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-768x462.jpg 768w, https://www.gazetaexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gjumi-2-184x111.jpg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Sleep is an autonomic function, like digestion or blood pressure. While we can influence sleep through healthy habits, we can't force it to happen. Obsessing over sleep quality can paradoxically worsen it," she added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, the best approach is to worry less about sleep—and let your body do what it's designed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even expecting to sleep a fixed number of hours each night can increase the risk of insomnia, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Expecting rigid consistency from sleep creates unrealistic expectations. Some nights will be better than others—and that’s normal. Healthy sleep is not a fixed number of hours—it’s dynamic and responsive to our lives. Factors like stress, physical health, age, environment, even parental responsibilities all affect sleep,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insomnia is common and treatable—and no, it’s not your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People often need about 10 to 20 minutes to fall asleep after turning off the lights, according to the Sleep Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, a study found that around one in six Britons suffer from insomnia, but 65 per cent never seek help for their sleep problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey of 2,000 people, conducted by The Sleep Charity, found that nine out of ten people experience some kind of sleep problem, while one in two engage in high-risk or dangerous behavior when they can't sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep has been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer, stroke and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts have long advised that waking up during the night does not necessarily mean you have insomnia, which is estimated to affect up to 14 million Britons.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, sleep deprivation has its own consequences—from irritability and short-term lack of focus, to an increased risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the American Sleep Association, nearly 70 million Americans also have a sleep disorder. /GazetaExpress/&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Here’s some potential good news for runners or people fresh off knee surgery: Your creaking knees might not indicate deeper health issues. New research finds that knee creaking is not associated with a greater risk of arthritis in people recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Scientists at La Trobe University in Australia led the study, which examined the long-term outcomes of young patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Though people with knee creaking did experience more pain on average in the first year following surgery, they ultimately fared no worse than people without creaky knees years later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that creaky knees might not be a reliable predictor of future arthritis, even in people healing from traumatic injuries, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A noisy universal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having a snap, crackle, and pop knee is formally known as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/osteoarthritis/crepitus"&gt;knee crepitus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a common condition, &lt;a href="https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(24)00414-X/fulltext"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to affect about 41% of the general public. While people of all ages can have knee crepitus, including people who aren’t experiencing any pain, studies have shown it’s especially common in people with osteoarthritis. That’s led some doctors to argue that crepitus should be seen as a clear early warning signal of arthritis in high-risk groups, including knee surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test out this hypothesis, the researchers recruited 112 young patients (median age 28) who had their ACL repaired. Following surgery, the participants’ knee health was tracked for five years, which included people’s self-assessment of relevant symptoms like knee pain and crepitus; the participants also received an MRI of their knee one year and five years after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Creaking but not broken&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though people with crepitus did have a tougher time at first, things eventually balanced out for both groups, the researchers observed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We found that those with knee crepitus demonstrated more than two and a half times greater rates of full-thickness cartilage defects in the kneecap area, with more pain and poorer function early on,” said lead author Jamon Couch, a physical therapist and graduate researcher at La Trobe, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-noisy-knees-early-arthritis.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “But over the next four years, those with crepitus did not experience worse pain and function compared to those without knee crepitus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with ruptured ACLs are at higher long-term risk for osteoarthritis in general. So the findings, &lt;a href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25637"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Arthritis Care and Research, should provide some reassurance that having creaky knees isn’t a sure-fire predictor for later issues, the researchers say, particularly in younger people recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While this study focused on ACL patients specifically, there are other reasons to believe knee creaking on its own shouldn’t be seen as a major concern for the average person. A review last year by the same authors &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39375004/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that 36% of people without knee pain experience crepitus, for instance, just a smidge below the percentage seen in the overall public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts do &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/by-itself-knee-crunching-sound-generally-not-cause-for-concern/"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that people who have other knee symptoms besides crepitus, such as pain or swelling, should consider seeing a doctor to have it checked out. There’s also a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/knee-exercises-for-runners/"&gt;strengthening exercises&lt;/a&gt; out there that can help you improve or maintain your knee health, especially if you run.

Last week, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;White House abruptly fired the CDC director&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Susan Monarez, claiming that she did not “&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5474649-white-house-cdc-susan-monarez-firing/?fbclid=IwY2xjawMfM6ZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETFNa1ZudVFBUXNMU21HdVRqAR6if960QcJ-bTsx9bVdOwWvXmr2Kxk7Ghmq5coD4SiGJ9ktdMvrSKAHr456CA_aem_ADunaI9vqjdotZgT18EJLA" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;align&lt;/a&gt;” with Donald Trump’s agenda. She also &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-administration-news-today-latest" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; clashed with Kennedy over vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her ousting triggered the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-rally-staffers-protest" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;resignations&lt;/a&gt; of several other senior CDC officials, including Dr Demetre Daskalakis, the former head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent interview, Daskalakis even &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5478469-rfk-jr-has-never-been-briefed-by-cdc-experts-on-measles-covid-19-or-flu-former-official-says/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said that&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy has never been briefed by CDC experts on several health issues including measles, Covid-19 or the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“No one from my center has ever briefed him on any of those topics,” Daskalakis told &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/28/politics/video/cdc-leaders-resign-rfk-jr-src-digvid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. “Perhaps he has alternate experts that he may trust more than the experts at CDC that the rest of the world regards as the best scientists in the areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He’s getting information from somewhere, but that information is not coming from CDC experts who really are the world’s experts in this area … and he’s not taking us up on several offers to brief him on these very important topics,” Daskalakis added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Wednesday morning, more than 1,000 current and former HHS employees signed a public &lt;a href="https://www.savehhs.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; demanding Kennedy’s resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The letter accused Kennedy of putting US public health at risk and criticized his role in firing Monarez. It also blasts him for “appointing political ideologues” to influential vaccine policy positions, “refusing to be briefed by well-regarded CDC experts on vaccine-preventable diseases” and “rescinding the FDA’s emergency use authorizations for Covid-19 vaccines”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this week, nine former CDC officials penned a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/01/former-cdc-officials-rfk-jr-endangering-americans-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guest essay&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Times in which they called Kennedy’s leadership “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and “unacceptable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In that letter, the staffers accused him of fueling harassment and violence directed at government healthcare staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Despite the mounting pressure, Kennedy did not address Monarez’s firing, the subsequent resignations or the growing calls for his resignation in his editorial this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, Kennedy defended the Trump administration’s role in what he described as “restoring public trust” in the CDC, which he argued had been “corroded” in recent years by “bureaucratic inertia, politicized science and mission creep”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy, who previously founded an anti-vaccine group, also criticized the CDC’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, calling it a “failure”, and blasted policies such as social distancing, mask mandates, lockdowns, and “the suppression of low-cost therapeutics in favor of experimental and ineffective drugs”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/hearings/the-presidents-2026-health-care-agenda" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;is scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to testify before the Senate finance committee on Thursday for a hearing on Trump’s healthcare agenda, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/ahead-of-rfk-jr-appearance-before-finance-committee-wyden-demands-end-to-secrecy-and-stonewalling-at-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;committee’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNSEhEU3M0aUgzdHR2LXR3NDNMNnNSNzZXUWJJeWM5Nk5XTWI5SE9Fek9ETXBiMDFyZmliVklrYUJldTl4N2VFaUxPVVAxbjZzaHF0SFc2ZG1IcHo0bkViZVJITW5iVTNkWWNsTGM1RmR3TzNwZmpXZ1dOOEZsU2cweFpRY19GYW1CRlE</guid></item><item><title>研究人员指出可以在诊断前几年预测痴呆症的新症状- dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15060917/Early-senseory-symptom-dementia-years-diagnosis.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Losing your sense of smell can be one of the earliest signs that you're developing dementia, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The memory-robbing illness, which affects the lives of millions, causes problems with memory, language and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But changes to our senses—which occur years before the devastating illness is formally diagnosed and appear to be unconnected—could be a key warning sign we are developing the life-shattering disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The German researchers found that this is because the immune system attacks vital nerve fibres linked to detecting scent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team looked at mice, as well as PET brain scans in living patients and post-mortem tissues from &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-26a8fec0-88ab-11f0-8195-0fec413e30af" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mice, they found early damage to the nerve fibres that link the olfactory bulb—the brain's scent hub—to the locus coeruleus that aids sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the PET scans confirmed the same pathway observed in the rodents was disrupted in living human patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, the brain tissue samples from deceased Alzheimer's patients revealed the chemical changes that trick the immune system into destroying the fibres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fresh study suggests loss of sense of smell could be one of the earliest signs of dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists say these consistent &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62500-8#Sec10"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt;, which were published in the journal Nature Communications, strongly show that losing your sense of smell is an early sign of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Jochen Herms of the University of Munich said: 'Our findings could pave the way for earlier identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, he explained could 'enable them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An early diagnosis for dementia is considered critical, as while the condition is incurable, treatments can combat symptoms and sometimes slow progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, other researchers &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14798359/signs-dementia-memory-sensory-changes.html"&gt;found &lt;/a&gt;changes in sight, hearing, taste, touch and balance also strike years before more well-known symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have also warned that problems with spatial awareness—for instance, standing too close to people—are also potential dementia warning signs which can occur up to twenty years before typical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Classic symptoms of dementia include issues with memory, thinking speed, mental sharpness and quickness, language, understanding, judgement and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 944,000 people in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around seven million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the Alzheimer's Society estimated the overall annual cost of  dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs—which include the lost earnings of unpaid carers—are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analysis by Alzheimer's Research UK found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fresh findings follow research published just days ago that revealed a sense of purpose can lower your risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American scientists who published their findings in The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry followed more than 13,000 adults aged 45 and older for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found people with ah higher sense of purpose in life were 8 per cent less likely to develop cognitive impairment—including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This protective effect was seen even when factors like race, ethnicity, education, genetics and depression are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings show that having a sense of purpose helps the brain stay resilient with age,' said Aliza Wingo, lead author of the study, and professor at UC Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even for people with a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, sense of purpose was linked to a later onset and lower likelihood of developing dementia'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found those with higher purpose experienced cognitive decline on average 1.4 months later than those without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

If anything, they just got worse. Then, the coughing started—which the mother-of-three thought was the so-called hundred day cough that ran rampage last winter.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't until she began experiencing breathlessness a few days before &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/christmas/index.html" id="mol-20bb5730-8813-11f0-b761-7f9717a666fb"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt; that she thought it could be something more serious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scans taken on December 20 revealed that she had a significant amount of fluid in her lungs, which doctors were concerned could be a warning sign of blood cancer —and what would be an incurable diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, her haematologist mentioned that around half of patients diagnosed with a different type of cancer, called thymoma—a rare type of cancer that starts in the thymus gland in between the lungs—also have an autoimmune disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve thought she was suffering from common digestive issues when she was unable to finish her meal whilst on holiday with her family in October half term &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve (pictured left) with her children Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to the GP who gave her antacids to ease her symptoms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Even still, her doctors' primary concern was blood cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling the heartbreaking ordeal, Ms Fanning told the Daily Mail: 'When they detected fluid in my lungs and said they'd need to start treatment immediately my heart sunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Two of my children have birthdays in January, so after my biopsy, I ran around trying to get the last bits together—balloons and presents—the call came two days later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'On January 4 I was told I likely had blood cancer and that they had a bed for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was heartbreaking having to explain to my children that I wasn't going to be there for them. They watched from the window as I left, crying their eyes out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ten days later, Ms Fanning was discharged from hospital whilst doctors waited on test results to confirm whether it was blood cancer or in fact thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I asked what my prognosis was, I was told I would just have to be patient and wait for the results. It was horrendous.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Devastatingly, the tests confirmed stage four thymoma that had spread to the lining of her lungs, meaning it was incurable—an avoidable prognosis had it been caught earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only in December when she started experiencing breathlessness alongside a persistent cough that she thought it could be something more serious &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve went to A&amp;amp;E and was immediately referred for scans which revealed fluid in her lungs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Given her symptoms, doctors were concerned that she could have blood cancer which had spread to the lining of her lungs - an incurable prognosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maeve was admitted for scans and a biopsy that same day &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now Ms Fanning is doing everything she can to see her three children—Oonagh, 9, Cormac, 5, and Ciaran, 2— grow up, despite being told that palliative chemotherapy, which would give her two years at most, was the only option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other cancers, experts do not know exactly causes thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus is a gland in the chest, between the lungs, which produces and releases hormones and helps the body fight off infections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is thought that people diagnosed with thymoma are more likely to also have an autoimmune disease—which is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy cells in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thymus gland helps keeps the immune system functioning properly, which may explain the link between autoimmune disease and thymoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite being diagnosed with oral lichen planus a year earlier—an autoimmune disorder affecting the skin which lines the inside of the mouth—after suffering from painful mouth ulcers, the link with thymoma was never mentioned until it was too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Fanning started chemotherapy just over a week later on February 14 2025, but after just one round she was told the dose was too high and her body was struggling to cope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point she weighed just over 6 stone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After spending 10 days in hospital, Maeve was discharged without treatment as doctors waited on the results of further scans which would confirm her diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After an agonising wait, Maeve was eventually diagnosed with stage four thymoma - a rare but aggressive type of cancer which forms in the thymus gland between the lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heartbreakingly, Maeve was given a very bleak prognosis of two years at most and was told that palliative care was the only option &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

(CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, has puzzled doctors for years. Nearly four million Americans and more than 30 million people worldwide live with this condition, yet treatment options remain limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional heart failure, where the heart muscle weakens and struggles to pump, HFpEF looks normal on scans. The heart still pushes blood forward, but it cannot relax and fill properly between beats. That stiffness makes you feel short of breath, drained of energy, and sometimes swollen in the legs, belly, or lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, high blood pressure was thought to be the primary culprit. But a new idea challenges that view. According to Milton Packer, MD, Distinguished Scholar in Cardiovascular Science at Baylor University Medical Center and Visiting Professor at Imperial College London, the real driver may not be the heart at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team suggests that signals coming from fat tissue could be behind much of the disease. Their theory, called the Adipokine Hypothesis, was published in &lt;em&gt;JACC&lt;/em&gt; and presented at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Central illustration: Lines of evidence supporting the Adipokine Hypothesis of HFpEF. (CREDIT: Packer M, JACC 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fat as a Messenger, Not Just Storage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people picture fat as little more than stored calories. In reality, fat is a living organ that sends out chemical messages across the body. These messengers, called adipokines, are proteins and hormones that can influence your heart, blood vessels, metabolism, and immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fat is healthy, adipokines protect organs, reduce inflammation, and help control fluid balance. But when fat becomes excessive and unhealthy, the signals change. Harmful adipokines are released in higher amounts while the protective ones decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in fat biology, Packer explains, transforms fat into an organ that drives stress, inflammation, and scarring inside the heart. “Up to now, there has been no unifying hypothesis to explain HFpEF. That has resulted in significant misunderstanding and a lack of direction in both diagnosis and therapy,” he said. “This bold new framework helps to identify the true cause of HFpEF in most people. That should make an enormous difference in guiding effective treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Related Stories&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Fat Signals Disrupt the Heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new framework outlines several ways that adipokines from unhealthy fat might set HFpEF in motion. One route is inflammation. When fat tissue becomes stressed, it attracts immune cells that release even more inflammatory chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecules damage blood vessel linings and heart muscle cells. Another pathway is vascular stiffness. Arteries lose flexibility, making it harder for blood to move and raising pressure inside the heart. Over time, scarring—or fibrosis—sets in. That scar-like tissue prevents the heart from relaxing and filling properly. Add in metabolic stress from conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, and the cycle accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a heart that seems to pump normally but fails to deliver enough blood to meet the body’s needs during exertion. Climbing a flight of stairs may suddenly feel exhausting, not because the heart cannot squeeze, but because it cannot fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis: Secretion of Adipokines From Biologically Transformed Visceral Adipose Tissue Leads to HFpEF. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strong Evidence Builds the Case&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis pulls together findings from many different fields. Patients with HFpEF almost always show extra fat stored deep inside the body, often wrapping around organs like the heart. Laboratory experiments in animals and cells demonstrate that adipokines can directly impair relaxation of heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood vessel studies confirm that harmful adipokines limit dilation, which forces blood pressure up. And clinical data reveal that HFpEF commonly strikes those with metabolic syndrome—a cluster of obesity, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure—pointing again to fat’s central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea powerful is that it unites these scattered observations under one roof. Instead of viewing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension as separate risks, it links them through the signals fat tissue sends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shifting the Way Doctors Think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Packer is correct, HFpEF is not only a heart problem but a systemic disease. The heart shows the symptoms, but the roots spread across the body, starting with fat. This perspective changes how doctors might diagnose and treat patients. Rather than focusing only on cardiac function, physicians could measure inflammation markers, study fat distribution, and check waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Mediators of Adipocyte Dysfunction to the Heart. Adipose tissue can secrete a broad array of molecules and cellular constituents that can act in an endocrine or paracrine manner to exert favorable or deleterious effects on the heart. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packer stresses that body mass index, or BMI, is a poor guide because it is influenced by muscle and bone. Instead, the waist-to-height ratio is more telling. A healthy ratio is less than 0.5, meaning your waist is less than half your height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HFpEF patients have a ratio above 0.5, and often above 0.6, even if they do not meet obesity criteria by BMI. “In patients with an elevated waist-to-height ratio, clinicians should be very vigilant to ask about potential symptoms of HFpEF,” he noted. Shortness of breath, often blamed on weight alone, may signal a treatable heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Treatments May Already Be Here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking implication of the hypothesis is that drugs may help by changing fat biology rather than directly targeting the heart. Several medications already approved for other uses appear to reshape adipokine profiles. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, originally designed for diabetes and weight loss, have shown encouraging effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By shrinking unhealthy fat and restoring healthier signaling, these drugs may reduce inflammation and scarring that drive HFpEF. Experimental studies support the idea, and more clinical trials are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle measures that reduce harmful fat—like diet, exercise, or surgery—could also prove essential. If confirmed, this approach would offer a range of new strategies for the millions struggling with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;Characterization of Adipokine Domains. In healthy people, adipocytes primarily secrete Domain I adipokines, with minimal secretion of Domain II adipokines and with suppression of Domain III adipokines. In people with visceral adiposity or obesity, adipose tissue secretes primarily Domain III adipokines, with suppression of Domain I adipokines. (CREDIT: JACC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis is still a theory, not a proven fact. Much of the current evidence comes from models and associations. Scientists need more large-scale clinical studies to pinpoint which adipokines matter most, how they interact with other risk factors, and whether altering them truly improves outcomes. Still, experts see promise. Packer himself notes that 33 years ago he proposed the neurohormonal hypothesis for another type of heart failure, and that theory transformed treatment. The hope is that this new one could spark a similar revolution for HFpEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the Adipokine Hypothesis could shift both prevention and treatment of heart failure. Doctors may screen patients using waist-to-height ratios, giving earlier warning of risk. Patients with high ratios could receive therapies aimed at reducing harmful fat signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved drugs like semaglutide may gain new roles in managing HFpEF. For patients, this means that shortness of breath and fatigue often brushed aside as “just weight issues” might be recognized as treatable heart symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a public health level, the findings highlight the urgent need to address rising obesity rates, since HFpEF cases are expected to rise sharply in coming decades. By tackling fat as an active organ, science may open new doors for prevention and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: The article above provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like these kind of feel good stories?

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/beta-blockers-cardiac-jacks-of-all-trades"&gt;Millions of people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; take &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blocker"&gt;beta blockers&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems, especially after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two new studies suggest that for many patients, these drugs may no longer be helpful – and in some cases, they could even be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta blockers work to lower heart rate and blood pressure, reducing the oxygen demands of the heart. Traditionally, they've been prescribed after a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/doctor-realizes-hes-having-a-heart-attack-while-treating-heart-attack-patient"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; (myocardial infarction) to give the heart time to heal and reduce the risk of a second attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heart-cancer-strikes-very-rarely-an-expert-reveals-why"&gt;Heart Cancer Strikes Very Rarely. An Expert Reveals Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the catch: since beta blockers were introduced more than four decades ago, modern medical care approaches (including &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angioplasty/about/pac-20384761"&gt;stents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/how-statin-drugs-protect-the-heart"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt;) have dramatically improved recovery after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, many hearts rebound better than they once did. For women whose hearts recover well, the new research suggests that beta blockers may do more harm than good – increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-takeaway-food-packaging-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-failure"&gt;cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt; and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beta blockers have long been a foundational treatment after acute myocardial&lt;br&gt;
infarction; their use was initially supported by the results of early randomized trials," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in one of their published papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7200.1730"&gt;these trials&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in an era that predates what is now modern standard care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether beta blockers still make sense today, scientists in Spain and Italy studied 8,438 patients across 109 healthcare centers who had survived a heart attack and had a left ventricular &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure/diagnosing-heart-failure/ejection-fraction-heart-failure-measurement"&gt;ejection fraction&lt;/a&gt; (EF) above 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A normal EF – a measure of how efficiently the heart pumps blood– is 55–70 percent; below 40 percent indicates significant dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of the patients were treated with beta blockers in addition to standard care, while the other half were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an average of 3.7 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference between these groups in rates of a second &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, hospitalization for heart failure, or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then ran the numbers on just the 1,627 women – a group who were older, had more comorbidities, and received fewer guideline-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women on beta blockers actually fared worse, with higher risks of complications and death. The risk was greatest in women whose hearts had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;recovered the best&lt;/a&gt; and in those taking the highest doses.

That has resulted in significant misunderstanding and a lack of direction in both diagnosis and therapy,” he said. “This bold new framework helps to identify the true cause of HFpEF in most people. That should make an enormous difference in guiding effective treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-vn45ei" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_fat_signals_disrupt_the_heart"&gt;How Fat Signals Disrupt the Heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new framework outlines several ways that adipokines from unhealthy fat might set HFpEF in motion. One route is inflammation. When fat tissue becomes stressed, it attracts immune cells that release even more inflammatory chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecules damage blood vessel linings and heart muscle cells. Another pathway is vascular stiffness. Arteries lose flexibility, making it harder for blood to move and raising pressure inside the heart. Over time, scarring—or fibrosis—sets in. That scar-like tissue prevents the heart from relaxing and filling properly. Add in metabolic stress from conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, and the cycle accelerates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a heart that seems to pump normally but fails to deliver enough blood to meet the body’s needs during exertion. Climbing a flight of stairs may suddenly feel exhausting, not because the heart cannot squeeze, but because it cannot fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1ouhlv3" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;The Adipokine Hypothesis: Secretion of Adipokines From Biologically Transformed Visceral Adipose Tissue Leads to HFpEF.

Patients with HFpEF almost always show extra fat stored deep inside the body, often wrapping around organs like the heart. Laboratory experiments in animals and cells demonstrate that adipokines can directly impair relaxation of heart muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood vessel studies confirm that harmful adipokines limit dilation, which forces blood pressure up. And clinical data reveal that HFpEF commonly strikes those with metabolic syndrome—a cluster of obesity, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure—pointing again to fat’s central role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this idea powerful is that it unites these scattered observations under one roof. Instead of viewing obesity, diabetes, and hypertension as separate risks, it links them through the signals fat tissue sends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-vn45ei" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="shifting_the_way_doctors_think"&gt;Shifting the Way Doctors Think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Packer is correct, HFpEF is not only a heart problem but a systemic disease. The heart shows the symptoms, but the roots spread across the body, starting with fat. This perspective changes how doctors might diagnose and treat patients. Rather than focusing only on cardiac function, physicians could measure inflammation markers, study fat distribution, and check waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1ouhlv3" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Mediators of Adipocyte Dysfunction to the Heart.

Instead, the waist-to-height ratio is more telling. A healthy ratio is less than 0.5, meaning your waist is less than half your height. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most HFpEF patients have a ratio above 0.5, and often above 0.6, even if they do not meet obesity criteria by BMI. “In patients with an elevated waist-to-height ratio, clinicians should be very vigilant to ask about potential symptoms of HFpEF,” he noted. Shortness of breath, often blamed on weight alone, may signal a treatable heart problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-vn45ei" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="treatments_may_already_be_here"&gt;Treatments May Already Be Here&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One striking implication of the hypothesis is that drugs may help by changing fat biology rather than directly targeting the heart. Several medications already approved for other uses appear to reshape adipokine profiles. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, originally designed for diabetes and weight loss, have shown encouraging effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By shrinking unhealthy fat and restoring healthier signaling, these drugs may reduce inflammation and scarring that drive HFpEF. Experimental studies support the idea, and more clinical trials are underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle measures that reduce harmful fat—like diet, exercise, or surgery—could also prove essential. If confirmed, this approach would offer a range of new strategies for the millions struggling with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1ouhlv3" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Characterization of Adipokine Domains.

Much of the current evidence comes from models and associations. Scientists need more large-scale clinical studies to pinpoint which adipokines matter most, how they interact with other risk factors, and whether altering them truly improves outcomes. Still, experts see promise. Packer himself notes that 33 years ago he proposed the neurohormonal hypothesis for another type of heart failure, and that theory transformed treatment. The hope is that this new one could spark a similar revolution for HFpEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="22" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, the Adipokine Hypothesis could shift both prevention and treatment of heart failure. Doctors may screen patients using waist-to-height ratios, giving earlier warning of risk. Patients with high ratios could receive therapies aimed at reducing harmful fat signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="23" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already approved drugs like semaglutide may gain new roles in managing HFpEF. For patients, this means that shortness of breath and fatigue often brushed aside as “just weight issues” might be recognized as treatable heart symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-asdrp1" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="24" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a public health level, the findings highlight the urgent need to address rising obesity rates, since HFpEF cases are expected to rise sharply in coming decades.

Simple carbs include food items like white bread, pastries, and sugary drinks. When eaten, these break down quickly into glucose, thus causing rapid spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels. However, when we have complex carbs-- like whole grains, legumes, and vegetables-- they are digested slowly due to their high fiber content. And so, they slowly release glucose, thus providing steady energy, preventing sudden sugar spikes, and improving insulin sensitivity over time.

Perhaps a kind friend could have suggested to Bi that there were other explanations. Instead, Bi had a set of legal adversaries and a supportive echo chamber. On Facebook, GCs and IPs alike expressed sympathy for Bi’s tragic posts: Everyone knew bad surrogates existed, and based on Bi’s claims, it sounded like Smith was one. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a Bay Area fertility doctor and influencer, called Smith “a criminal” and “a psycho.” Bi’s $1,275-an-hour lawyer, Elizabeth Sperling, wondered whether digging through social media posts might show Smith engaging in “strenuous activity” that could explain the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Bi’s husband focused on stabilizing the family, a move he credits with saving their marriage. He blamed the hospital, not Smith, but told me that the litigation is “her grieving process.” He tried to stay out of the legal stuff so that Bi couldn’t blame him too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Smith had planned&lt;/span&gt; to go back to work shortly after giving birth. Instead, she couldn’t stop bleeding. Even though SAI had determined she hadn’t breached the contract, the escrow stopped paying, leaving Smith reliant on disability benefits as she faced an increasing pile of terrifying bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;When Smith was finally cleared to return to work, a month after Leon died, Bi emailed Smith’s HR department to ask about her health plan. Bi also reported Smith to a federal agency, claiming that Smith was committing fraud. The stress on Smith was already high: Her supervisor at work had found her crying on and off for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Smith hadn’t heard from Bi since her terse reply to the condolence email. Then, Bi texted her a screenshot of a Facebook post about another GC who’d had an abruption at almost 32 weeks—but that GC had called 911 and the baby had lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Next, Bi iMessaged a photo of Leon’s corpse to Smith’s 7-year-old son’s iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;In the months&lt;/span&gt; after Leon died, Bi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Called the FBI 12 times. Reported Smith, SAI, the hospital, and Clarity escrow to more than a dozen state and federal regulators and numerous professional organizations. Launched a new round of her $30 million venture fund, backed by Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, President Trump’s “AI and crypto czar,” on Leon’s due date. Posted Leon’s ChatGPT-written endorsement from heaven, offering his “eternal blessings” for her work. Created TikToks, Instagram Reels, Facebook posts, X threads, LinkedIn Updates, and a website for her advocacy. Posted links disclosing Smith’s full name, photo, address, employer, mortgage license number, and son’s first name to her website. Asked her husband, again and again, how it was possible that Smith had carried her son but felt “nothing” about his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe hyVpEN callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ bkfwbX caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE hMBSFK caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby Leon’s empty crib.&lt;/p&gt;

She got on lithium for her bipolar disorder in early 2021 and began looking for surrogates as soon as she stopped feeling “sedated.” I spoke to the therapist Bi hired to consult with her and Valdeiglesias. She told me that, of the 792 intended parents she has evaluated for surrogacy or gamete donation in the last decade, she has declined to recommend only about a dozen. “I’m not gatekeeping,” she said. When it comes to serious mental illness, she added, it’s up to them to disclose. One of Bi’s fertility doctors, meanwhile, told me it’s not his place to scrutinize intended parents. He defers to the recommendation of the psychological interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If an intended parent gets turned down, they can usually find another therapist, another clinic, another agency. But without anyone questioning her plans, Bi seemed betrayed by the challenges of third-party reproduction. “Surrogacy is supposed to be the safest route,” she wrote on Instagram. It wasn’t just Leon’s death that pushed Bi into her spiral of legal action and social media posts. It was the apparent lack of control of having her child inside another woman’s body—the most basic fact of surrogacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNU3FOeG1jSkVJTFBtXzR6U3FmeUp1UlRnVEpzM0VHeUlxbEpaVjVQQ1Y5VEN6eERXME1BQlppVS1XazRJd1o3dWFzUGEtNWxLbnZuaWlaTXp6YVJkb0F6b19xOXJ3c3pYVzB6MFlDZ2hBTnBNX0ZmdmpiUW5IZU9OU0YxdXRpc2M</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情波浪席卷加利福尼亚州。一些官员敦促居民戴上口罩--《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-03/as-covid-wave-washes-over-california-some-health-officials-urge-residents-to-mask-up</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;A COVID wave is washing over California, with the state seeing continued increases in the number of newly confirmed cases and hospitalizations as some officials urged the public to take greater precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of the recent increases has prompted some county-level health officials to recommend that residents once again consider wearing masks in indoor public settings, at least until transmission has declined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California currently has “high” coronavirus levels in sewage, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And increases are being seen across the Golden State, from Los Angeles County to the San Francisco Bay Area to areas around the state capital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that coronavirus infections are either “growing” or “likely growing” in 30 states, including California. Twenty-one states have either “very high” or “high” viral levels in wastewater. Of all regions of the U.S., the West has the highest levels of coronavirus in wastewater, followed by the South. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“California is experiencing a summer COVID wave,” said Dr. Aimee Sisson, the health officer in Yolo County, just west of Sacramento. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which coronavirus lab tests are coming back positive also continues to climb. For the week that ended Aug. 23, 12.07% of tests across the state came back positive, up from a rate of 6.03% for the week that ended July 26. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar leaps in rates were seen in L.A. County, where the positive test rate was 13.44%, up from 8.11% four weeks earlier; in Orange County, it was 18.1%, up from 9.4%; and in San Francisco, it was 8.7%, up from 7.1%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, the regional chief of infectious diseases at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said she received many calls related to outpatient cases of COVID-19 while on call over the Labor Day weekend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are definitely seeing an upswing in patients with COVID,” Hudson said. “Thankfully, inpatient cases are few and far between. Wastewater levels, however, are still rising in Los Angeles, so we have not reached the top of this current wave.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this summer hasn’t seen COVID activity to the extent of a year ago, when the state experienced its worst summer wave since 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will have to see what direction things go over the next one to two weeks to have a better idea” of where we end up, Hudson said. Students returning to school as well as from travel and socialization over the holiday weekend, could fuel further spread of the virus, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across California, the overall level of COVID hospital admissions remains “low,” but is increasing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week that ended Aug. 23, there were 3.62 hospital admissions for COVID for every 100,000 residents; up from a comparable rate of 1.9 four weeks earlier. The most recent rate is also higher than during the peak seen during the winter, which maxed out at 2.61 admissions for every 100,000 residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emergency department visits for COVID-like illness are also up in Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Clara counties. In L.A. County, 2.8% of emergency room visits were for illnesses such as fever plus a cough or sore throat, up from 2.2% four weeks earlier. In Orange County, 2.6% of ER visits were for COVID-like illness, up from 1.5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current percent of COVID-19 positivity is higher than at any point last winter,” according to Dr. Christopher Zimmerman of the Orange County Health Care Agency’s Communicable Disease Control Division and Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county’s health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Aug. 23, 1.9% of total hospitalizations in Orange County were due to COVID — higher than at any point seen during the winter, but less than half of last summer’s peak of 4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s unclear “how high or how severe this summer’s COVID wave may be,” Zimmerman and Chinsio-Kwong said, noting that this year’s rise began later than it did in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, COVID-19 hospitalizations are currently about as high as last winter’s peak, but remain lower than the peaks of the last two summers, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisson said that coronavirus levels are high in the wastewater of both Sacramento and West Sacramento, one of the most populous cities in Yolo County. Sisson &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.yolocounty.gov/Home/Components/News/News/14027/4918" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that everyone age 2 and up in West Sacramento “wear a mask when they are around others in indoor public spaces,” since coronavirus levels in sewage there are high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other areas of Yolo County, including UC Davis and Woodland, where viral levels in wastewater are considered “medium,” Sisson said she recommends that people wear masks around others indoors “if they are 65 or older, have a weakened immune system, have an underlying medical condition that puts them at a greater risk of severe COVID-19, or spend time around people who fall into these categories.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wearing a high-quality mask such as an N95, KN95, or KF94 that fits well continues to provide strong protection,” Sisson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus cases are increasing in Sacramento County, and coronavirus wastewater levels are considered high, according to Casey Camacho, a spokesperson for the Sacramento County Department of Health Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco Department of Public Health also is encouraging people “to consider wearing a well-fitted mask in crowded indoor spaces, including when traveling, and to stay at home if they feel sick.” Coronavirus levels in San Francisco wastewater, and COVID hospitalizations, are up this summer “but remain below last summer’s peaks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Santa Clara County, Northern California’s most populous county, COVID-related hospitalizations are up, and coronavirus levels are “high” in the sewershed of San José and Palo Alto. Current viral levels in wastewater are now similar to the levels seen in the summer of 2023, but haven’t reached last summer’s peak. COVID hospitalization rates also remain lower than recent summer seasons, public health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated 2025-26 version of the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be available within a few days at some of the nation’s pharmacy retailers, such as Walgreens and CVS. But some people are expressing frustration at new rules issued by the Trump administration that in effect require younger, healthy people under age 65 who don’t say they have an underlying health condition to consult with a healthcare provider to get a COVID vaccination in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination remains one of the most effective ways to prevent severe disease and death from COVID-19,” Sisson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement came under criticism by Dr. Jerome Adams, a former surgeon general who served under the first Trump administration. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/JeromeAdamsMD/status/1962906970089787442" target="_blank"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; on social media, Adams said requiring people to consult with a healthcare provider before getting a COVID vaccine puts up “real access barriers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have insurance and can get in to see a doctor (which is no small feat in the U.S.), many doctors are going to be reticent to prescribe a medication ‘off label,’ given the (in many cases unfounded) recent rhetoric from HHS leaders,” Adams wrote, referring to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which is led by the vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has a history of disparaging vaccines, has said he wants more studies on the COVID-19 shots. Other health experts have said seeking additional testing for COVID vaccines is unnecessary, given the extensive testing done before they were first distributed, and their track record since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line? It is both statistically (according to HHS’s own data) and pragmatically untrue that ‘100% of those who choose a Covid vaccine can get one.’ Continuing to repeat this reflects a lack of knowledge, empathy, or honesty,” Adams wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0gFBVV95cUxPWkdZQWpiRkNjV0dyWmRJYjhLRTFfY20zMkFWRERvaThiX1hmdEtuMkQtVGRuTk9waDgwVDF0MU9xWFZFODFTY254Ml9kM0szZFlxdFFBTUJqMjJpam9RSkFFbHhnWWVfcmdqdm1CTFhFVDlaTlV3OTZ2Ri15bGFqeUthV0t5b3FrbEJ3YjFwVUJURXRpcGlHSnYtdW1FSnFmZ0pqMG96LV9HSDJ0M09MM1FrTVJDY2hIRVNjdkFLaEU4ck9rWFlmM1JnYV9hNkpGZUE</guid></item><item><title>根据物理治疗师的说法，每个人在70岁后都应该做的6项基本运动，以增强力量和行动能力-汤姆指南</title><link>https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/here-are-the-6-exercises-everyone-should-do-after-turning-70-according-to-a-physical-therapist</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f"&gt;If you’re looking for exercises to improve your strength, balance, mobility, and function as you get older, you’ve come to the right place. As we age, strengthening the muscles in our body is more important than ever — strength training is one of the most effective ways to prevent sarcopenia, or the loss of muscle mass. It can also help build stronger bones and improve your balance and stability, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a complete beginner or are returning to exercise following a long break, the good news is that things don’t have to be overly complicated. In fact, just using your bodyweight and performing a few simple exercises a few times a week can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fa324cd6-a030-4aef-a3e4-537f69370a8f-2"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.nancy.dpt" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr Nancy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a physical therapist who specializes in exercises for older adults, and in a video posted to her social media accounts, she shares the six exercises she prescribes to patients between 70 and 90 years old. All of the exercises can be completed from home, and all you’ll need is a can of food from your cupboard, a chair, and a tea towel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises focus on the lower body, but you’ll still be working your core muscles if you do them correctly.

Here’s how to do them with good form:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-lateral-step-over" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-lateral-step-over"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Lateral step over &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="443f71f4-d1bc-44e4-9d5f-d9d5a3bc0ccf"&gt;For this exercise, use a can of food from the cupboard and place it on the floor. Step to one side of the can, and stand tall, engaging your core with your hands on your hips. Lift one leg and step over the can laterally, then follow with your other foot. Then, repeat the move, stepping back to the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-box-squats" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-box-squats"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Box squats &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="83cd6595-3a1b-4b5f-a9d9-02508c9de23a"&gt;For this exercise, place a box on top of a chair. Ensure the chair is sturdy and doesn’t have wheels. Squat down, bending at your knees and keeping your core engaged until your glutes touch the box, then push down through your feet to return to a standing position, squeezing your glutes at the top. As you get stronger, make the box lower to the chair, then remove it entirely. To make the exercise easier, extend your arms away from the body. To make it harder, place your hands on your hips. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-N8njy3Gr7pTwNE2JpojJ8k slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-standing-hip-extension" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-standing-hip-extension"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Standing hip extension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4c413bab-30f5-4b5a-ab7e-1294638f3ea9"&gt;For this exercise, stand facing a wall and place both hands on the wall for support. Shift your bodyweight into one leg, and straighten the other leg, keeping your foot flexed, before taking the leg back and lifting it a few inches off the floor. Keep kicking back for 10 reps, then switch onto the other leg. Aim for three sets of 10 reps on each leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-4-single-leg-slides" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-single-leg-slides"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Single leg slides &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="988f05a3-3742-41c1-965c-853097326459"&gt;For this exercise, you’ll need to grab a tea towel. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, and engage your core. Place one foot on a tea towel, and keeping a slight bend in both knees, slide the leg out to the side, then bring it back in, then slide it back behind you, moving slowly and with control. Keep the rest of your body still — it should only be the one leg that is moving. Complete 10 reps, then switch to work on the other leg. Complete three sets of 10 reps on each side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-standing-hip-flexion" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-standing-hip-flexion"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Standing hip flexion &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="c39987cf-4116-4193-94b0-a2a32356fac6"&gt;Standing facing a wall, place both hands on the wall for support. From here, engage your core and lift one leg off the ground, keeping a 90-degree bend in your knee to march your leg up towards your torso. Place the leg back on the floor, and repeat on the other side. Keep alternating sides. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-6-lateral-toe-taps" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-6-lateral-toe-taps"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Lateral toe taps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="3f83bd91-41e0-4166-8164-df7a56faf5d2"&gt;For this exercise, start with your feet hip-width apart and your core engaged. Place your hands on your hips. From here, lift one leg off the floor, point your toe, and tap the leg out to the side of your body. Return to your starting position, and repeat on the other side. Aim for three sets of 10 reps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9e3ca6d5-f2f2-4f35-9bfd-900f60099211"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e47481eb-b462-4ccb-b677-9d3f09f76f41"&gt;To make this workout easier, drop the number of sets — start by completing one, and work your way up. To make it harder, increase the difficulty of the exercises by increasing your range of motion — remove the box on the chair during the squats, or the size of the step in the lateral step overs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This exercise will work the muscles in your lower body as well as your core, and test your balance and stability. A lot of the exercises will work one side of the body at a time, and you might notice the exercises are easier on one side. This is normal, and working on your weaker side can help correct any imbalances in the body, reducing your risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

You’re feeling sick, we get sick, too. Just maneuver through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;His father taught him that a husband provides, a wife takes care of children. Emotional equity wasn’t built in their home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/brokenforbetter/?hl=en" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; had survived infidelity and rebuilt their lives as marriage coaches. They lived through the death of their teenage son in a car accident and became grief leaders. But when Schaer watched his wife Denette suffer from &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/07/12/what-is-perimenopause-first-signs-typical-age-and-what-to-know/70311139007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt; symptoms that grew to sharp mood swings, forgetfulness and extreme fatigue – he couldn't bear losing the woman he’d known for three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I needed to find compassion and empathy,” Schaer, 49, says. “Nothing in life I would have my wife walk through by herself.

He did laundry and other chores; many he admits that he should have been doing all along. He learned about hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“But most important,” he says, “I listened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Just as Gen X and millennial women are changing the way they approach perimenopause and menopause, piercing through the cultural zeitgeist, so are their husbands and partners. &lt;a href="https://mindpumppodcast.com/2582-the-strange-signs-symptoms-of-perimenopause-with-dr-mary-claire-haver/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bro fitness podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are now talking about hormones and strength training. Men are joining their wives for medical appointments, going to &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;menopause retreats&lt;/a&gt;, and making TikTok videos and &lt;a href="https://ravoke.com/four-days-life-health-journey/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;documentaries&lt;/a&gt;. They are doing so with both a sense of urgency and sometimes humor. One man even named his wife’s menopause symptoms “Agnes” to remind them that it is part of his wife, but not all of her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But the process by which men are approaching menopause in this generation is akin to other ways they are defining masculinity. Or, at the very least, exploring how they have understood what it means to be a man. Maybe masculinity still does mean taking care of and protecting your partner, being the breadwinner and remaining stoic all the same. But just like the men who understood changing a diaper in the 1990s didn't take away their manliness, so can participating in their spouse's emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This evolution in masculinity, where vulnerability and authenticity are valued, moves away from the restrictive path in which the men interviewed by USA TODAY were raised.

It can present with symptoms ranging from frozen shoulder to achy joints and often women suffer for years before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These are men who grew up with fathers who ignored menopause. These are men who now are realizing their mothers went through this and they didn’t even know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After all, there's a silence that had always accompanied women going through menopause. If they dared asked for help, it was about masking symptoms − and feelings − in order to please others. It was to not draw any more attention to the fact that they were aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;These also are men who see that while divorce rates overall are dropping,&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/08/14/divorce-women-perimenopause-menopause/85622804007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; divorces among adults 50&lt;/a&gt; and older are increasing.

When it was screened earlier this year, the majority of audiences were women. Then she noticed a shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Women were starting to bring their husbands or partners to help them understand this,” she says. “Half of the population will go through menopause, and we need the other half to understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Finding his vulnerability in talking about menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theparentexpress" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Jesse Robertson&lt;/a&gt; was driving home from his sales job when he heard menopause expert &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/17/mary-claire-haver-menopause-the-m-factor/75702888007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Mary Claire Haver&lt;/a&gt; on a health podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He was astounded by how often &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/07/23/hormone-therapy-estrogen-perimenopause-antidepressants/85282744007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;women are misdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;, the misunderstandings about hormone therapy, and his own ignorance. So, he posed a question on his parenting TikTok account this summer: “Do women want husbands to talk to them about menopause?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Hundreds of women told him they wanted men to learn more. The husband and father of two shifted his videos to menopause and perimenopause. He approaches it not as an expert, but someone learning along with other men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While it has grown his audience and given him a sense of pride in helping others, there’s been another more important transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It has brought him closer to his wife of 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85866080007-jesse-robertson-and-wife.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85866080007-jesse-robertson-and-wife.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=800&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Jesse Robertson says that learning more about perimenopause and menopause have brought him closer to his wife."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Jesse Robertson says that learning more about perimenopause and menopause have brought him closer to his wife." data-c-credit="Jesse Robertson"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s allowed me to have more vulnerable conversations with her,” says Robertson, 47, who lives in the Minneapolis area. “If I can talk to her about this, something sensitive, personal, and kind of uncomfortable for me, we can talk about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/12/15/bell-hooks-quotes-books-love-feminism/8910938002/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Bell Hooks&lt;/a&gt;, the late author and cultural critic, said that even the most loving of couples fall into the trap of avoiding emotions and projecting expectations onto the other person.

Men are from mars, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To love, she said, men and women must be willing to hear each others' truths without punishment or exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Now Robertson hears from men and couples who are watching his menopause videos together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It isn’t just women who have to go through it,” he says. “It’s something that partnerships have to go through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Men need to learn more and stop being (expletives)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Todd Maxwell was scrolling through his phone when he came across one of Robertson’s videos describing symptoms that sounded like his wife: fatigue and brain fog, frozen shoulder, and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I think this is what you might have,” he told her. “Perimenopause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She was only 40. When she told doctors, they discounted&lt;a href="/story/news/health/2024/12/04/menopause-perimenopause-the-excerpt/76758146007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; her symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the shoulder issues on exercise and the fatigue on their four children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When she had confided in Maxwell about hot flashes, he says he had made jokes about it. “It was awkward, and I didn’t know what to say,” he says. “I should have been more understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They separated this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I told her that I’m really sorry it took me this long to realize that I could have been more helpful,” says Maxwell, 47. “Men need to learn more and stop being (expletives.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Maxwell, an oil lineman, lives in a small town in Alberta, Canada. He grew up believing men don’t show emotion. Sharing how he felt, he thought, feel could only add to his wife’s burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He threw himself into being the kind of father that he never had – the kind that goes to hockey games and listens. But, he says, he didn’t put that same energy into understanding his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Until now. He started therapy. He’s reading books and watching videos to learn more about perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Now if I want to talk to my wife about how I’m feeling, I write in my journal. I take a walk,” he says. “I think about her feelings, what she needs. I want to be here for her, for my daughters and my sons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Men need to understand menopause is more than mood swings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.daveymaherfitness.com/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dave Maher&lt;/a&gt; began training women over 40, he saw that no matter what they ate or how much they exercised, they weren’t losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/28/USAT/85873375007-dave-maher-trainer.jpg?width=980&amp;amp;height=628&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Trainer Dave Maher says that treatment during menopause and perimenopause can improve health - from the brain to the heart."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Trainer Dave Maher says that treatment during menopause and perimenopause can improve health - from the brain to the heart." data-c-credit="Dave Maher"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It was also about hormones and estrogen, things that change drastically during perimenopause and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It’s insulting for us to tell midlife women to just eat less and move more,” he says. “Women have been gaslit and lied to and suffered needlessly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Perimenopause and menopause treatment is about health and longevity, not simply feeling better. It's about decreasing risks for &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/additional-treatments-for-dementia-risk/hormones" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9178928/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559623/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;building strength&lt;/a&gt; to stay out of an assisted living facility. It's about the quality of the last third of a woman's life. As Maher learned more, his business shifted to helping women better understand and get treatment – from hormone therapy to nutrition – in midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Men need to understand it’s not just mood swings,” says Maher, 41. “It’s the collapse of estrogen and progesterone and testosterone. Women need this to be healthy – for their hearts, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11387275/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;their brains&lt;/a&gt;.

While trawling survey data on household spending to try to understand why &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00676-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes were rising&lt;/a&gt; so rapidly in his home country, he was surprised to note that people were buying smaller quantities of sugar, salt and other ingredients generally associated with these conditions than they had in previous decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only when Monteiro and his colleagues dug deeper did they find the culprit. People were buying less sugar to prepare cakes and desserts, but eating more of it in pre-made pastries and breakfast cereal. They were buying less salt, but consuming more of it in frozen pizzas, chicken nuggets and dehydrated packet soups. “We realized the problem was our traditional dietary patterns were being replaced by foods that are processed so many times that they can no longer be recognized in the final products. We called them ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02750-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51412836.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Ultra-processed foods — it’s time for an improved definition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monteiro, a nutrition and public-health researcher at the University of São Paulo, first used &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01600-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the term ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt; (UPF) in a paper in 2009, arguing that people interested in promoting healthy diets should focus more on the degree, extent and purpose of processing than on nutrient profiles&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It was a radical idea that caught the attention of other researchers, who, over the next decade or so, published dozens of papers linking UPFs with obesity and a range of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments took notice, too. In 2014, Brazil began advising people to avoid UPFs. Other countries, including France, Belgium and Israel, followed suit. Robert F. Kennedy Jr, secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been a critic of UPFs, saying in January that they are “poisoning the American people”. In May, the US government announced plans for a research agenda to support nutrition policy and improve people’s diets, in part by improving understanding of the impacts of UPFs on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there’s good evidence that diets high in UPFs are associated with poor health, some scientists are sceptical that the UPF category is useful for research or as the basis for dietary advice, arguing that it is too broad and ill-defined. It makes little sense, they say, to lump together foods as diverse as shop-bought yogurts and wholegrain breads with doughnuts and potato crisps. And they wonder whether UPFs are largely linked to poor health just because they tend to be high in fat and sugar, and low in fibre and vitamins. Questions remain, but recent research findings can provide some guidance for people trying to make healthy choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changing diets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For hundreds of thousands of years, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01681-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;humans have been processing food&lt;/a&gt; by cooking it. The fermentation, milling, salting, pickling and smoking of food also have long histories. Canning, pasteurization and the use of additives, such as artificial sweeteners and colouring agents, date back to the nineteenth century. Today, many foods undergo multiple forms of advanced processing, such as fractionation into constituent sugars, oils and fibres; hydrogenation to alter physical properties; and extrusion, which subjects ingredients to high temperature, pressure, shear forces and rapid expansion. These foods are generally classified as UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPF consumption has grown since the 1950s, initially in high-income countries and, since the 1990s, in low- and middle-income countries&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Surveys suggest that UPFs make up almost 60% of calorie intake in the United States and United Kingdom, 48% in Canada and 42% in Australia (see ‘Ultra-processed intake’). Traditional eating patterns have proved more enduring in Romania (15% of calorie intake), Italy (18%), Brazil (22%) and France (31%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51396482.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ULTRA-PROCESSED INTAKE.

Dozens of studies have linked diets high in UPFs with increased risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, cancer, asthma, depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published last year, for example, epidemiologist Mingyang Song and his colleagues at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, analysed data on the diets and health of more than 110,000 US adults, who were tracked over a median period of more than 30 years. Song found that those with the highest proportion of calories from UPFs were 4% more likely to die of any cause during the study than were those with the lowest intake. Higher UPF consumption was associated with increased mortality from neurodegenerative diseases, but not from cardiovascular or respiratory disease or from cancer&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Diets that included more processed meat, poultry, seafood and sugary drinks were associated with higher risks after researchers controlled for factors such as body mass index, physical activity, alcohol consumption and family health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01969-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51250548.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggested that nutritional quality could be a big factor in why diets high in UPFs might be unhealthy. The increase in risk was much lower for those with diets that, although high in UPFs, were still defined as healthy according to a diet-scoring system called the Alternative Healthy Eating Index. Those diets included a lot of vegetables and nuts, and limited the intake of sugary drinks, red and processed meats, salt and trans fats. “The association between UPF consumption and mortality was much weaker once we accounted for dietary quality,” says Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, other research indicates that nutritional composition is not the whole story. When Samuel Dicken, a clinical scientist at University College London, reviewed 37 studies that reported health outcomes linked with UPFs, he found that almost all of the associations remained after researchers controlled for nutritional composition&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken and his colleagues subsequently ran a trial in which adults who were overweight or obese were asked to follow one of two diets defined as healthy according to the UK Eatwell Guide (see &lt;a href="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track="click" data-label="http://go.nature.com/4fpdeen" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;go.nature.com/4fpdeen&lt;/a&gt;), and then switched to the other diet. One of the diets was made up mostly of UPFs and the other mostly of minimally processed foods, but the two diets were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02096-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;matched for levels of protein&lt;/a&gt;, carbohydrate, fat, fibre, sodium and sugar. Participants lost twice as much weight (an average of 2 kilograms versus 1 kg) on the minimally processed diet compared with the UPF diet&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The findings, published in August, suggest that the increased prevalence of health problems linked to a UPF diet in other studies cannot be fully explained by poor nutritional composition. So what other mechanisms might be involved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond processing &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dicken’s study is one of only a handful of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on UPFs. Unlike retrospective and observational studies, RCTs can demonstrate causal links and so might offer a clearer picture, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first RCT on UPFs was carried out by a team led by integrative physiologist Kevin Hall, who until April was at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), part of the HHS. For more than a decade, Hall has sought to overcome some of the limitations of nutrition research by confining study participants to a research hospital, so that their diets can be precisely recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, he was approached by two Brazilian researchers at a meeting after he presented the results of one such study, comparing a low-carbohydrate, animal-product-based diet with a low-fat vegan diet. “They told me they had enjoyed my talk, but that my focus on nutrients was very twentieth century and that really, I should be thinking about the extent and purpose of processing food,” says Hall, who had not then heard of UPFs. He was sceptical but intrigued enough that he devised a trial in which 20 adults stayed at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and consumed a diet high in either UPFs or unprocessed food for two weeks before swapping diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Employees in protective clothing and hard hats check hundreds of breaded chicken nugget pieces on a factory production line conveyor belt." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_51384280.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Breaded chicken nuggets are inspected before being packaged at a factory near Orléans in France.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other researchers, Hall defined UPFs using a system developed by Monteiro. Known as NOVA, it classifies food into four groups according to the extent, type and purpose of processing&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as vegetables and pasta, are at one end of the scale. At the other end are UPFs, which undergo multiple industrial processes and usually contain substances rarely used in home kitchens, such as high-fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils and additives, including colouring and emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in Hall’s RCT could eat as much as they liked, but the food presented to them was matched for nutrient groups. To Hall’s surprise, the results, published in 2019, showed that participants consumed around 500 calories more per day on average while on the UPF diet — and gained an average of 0.9 kg over the two weeks&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. They lost that same amount of weight while on the unprocessed diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hall dug further into the results to try to understand why people on some diets, including those high in UPFs, eat more calories, he and his colleagues found that people consumed more if they ate quicker&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Participants also consumed more calories when the foods were energy dense (containing more calories per gram) and “hyper-palatable” — containing ingredients high in combinations of fat, carbohydrates, sugar and salt, which, some researchers say, activate reward signals and circumvent satiety mechanisms in the brain&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR11" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Energy-dense foods provide more calories in less time than those with fewer calories per gram because they are easier to eat, and many UPFs are energy dense because their water content has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00549-7" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02754-w/d41586-025-02754-w_50690036.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How a junk-food splurge can change your brain activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But questions remained about what might be driving the extra intake, so Hall set up another trial, this time involving 36 people who spent a week each eating a minimally processed diet and three UPF diets: one was energy dense and hyper-palatable; another was energy dense but not hyper-palatable; and the last was neither energy dense nor hyper-palatable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is ongoing, but early findings show that participants ate more and gained more weight while on the energy-dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet compared with the minimally processed diet. Most of the increases in consumption and body weight that occurred on the energy dense, hyper-palatable UPF diet also occurred on the energy dense diet low in hyper-palatable foods, suggesting that energy density could be the more important factor to health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that eating more slowly and eating diets with low energy density are associated with lower calorie consumption — and that various factors, including &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03243-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;food texture&lt;/a&gt;, can affect eating speed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR12" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, Ciarán Forde, a nutrition researcher at Wageningen University &amp;amp; Research in the Netherlands, asked 50 adults to eat as much as they liked during four lunches. He found that they ate much less when presented with hard-textured foods, such as potato waffle fries, than when given soft-textured foods such as mashed potato, regardless of whether the foods were UPFs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR13" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “What we saw was that the speed of eating and the texture properties of meals drive consumption, not the degree of processing,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forde’s team went on to ask 41 adults to follow, for 14 days, either a UPF diet consisting of foods with harder textures associated with slow eating, or a UPF diet made up of softer foods linked to faster eating, and then swap over. The meals presented were matched for energy density, and, Forde says, the energy density of foods that participants actually consumed turned out to be the same as well. Although the full results are yet to be published, participants consumed 369 fewer calories per day, on average, when their diet consisted of slowly consumed foods than when it contained those linked to faster consumption, according to initial results Forde presented at a meeting of the American Society for Nutrition in Orlando, Florida, in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe a combination of energy density and food texture explains why people eat more, says Forde, who has received funding from multinational food companies. “Maybe it’s not something magic in ultra-processed foods that we don’t understand. Rather it’s just about factors we’ve long known, about how foods are eaten and how they drive meal size.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Malla explains that while antipsychotic medications are effective, they only go some way to addressing symptoms of disease. "Antipsychotic medication really only works for positive symptoms, which are things that should not be there, like illusions or hallucinations," says Malla. Negative symptoms are the absence of things that should be there, such as emotional expression, ability to generate thoughts and ability to relate socially to people. The reverse of which would be social withdrawal, a lack of experience, feelings and so on. "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-psychiatry/article/epa-guidance-on-assessment-of-negative-symptoms-in-schizophrenia/86280E47EC2DA56EC5F9D8B951DF698E" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Medications have very little, if any, impact on these&lt;/a&gt;," says Malla. Generally, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/psychological-and-psychosocial-interventions-for-negative-symptoms-in-psychosis-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/73B8450EAB1E3046B4ABE0C3C4C5A1D2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;negative symptoms, like low mood, respond poorly to drugs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Americans overestimate how often people with mental illnesses are perpetrators of violent crimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Malla suggests that the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32981550/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;social differences between India and Canada&lt;/a&gt; go some way to explain the difference in the success of treatments. Homelessness is less common among people with schizophrenia in Chennai, for example. Malla puts this down to families wanting to keep mental illness within the household so that any stigma associated with having a family member with schizophrenia can be "kept under wraps". He says that marriage is a key concern for families, and anything that might affect an offspring's marriageability will be dealt with as a family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Malla points out that families in Canada are as interested in taking care of their sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, as they are in India. But he says that the sophisticated legalisation of contact and confidentiality with patients can be a problem. A young adult in North America can more easily leave home and cut off contact if they wish, he says. But this could lead to worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/inm.13198" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Family interventions have been shown to be effective&lt;/a&gt; in improving recovery from psychosis. "In Chennai, a patient hardly ever comes to the clinic without a family member. We hypothesised that it would result in a better outcome on negative symptoms," says Malla. "And that's exactly what we found." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:07:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRDlSR3BvOWpEZVpJZkZMLVlpV3ppdl80cmRKMDRoMl8wRmdVVVBQeDlqRlBtM19VUW5TdVdHSHh5MTItd1FkbGluT3pPVzItNEhqVlM4ek03T0Fwa1ZoTlJ1OFlHd21FNGVXX1hqR0luNmxrbjVvTE1yMnBvaEVwdE1aMDVNUFNjcVZKTllHcEROR1JNZWRpODVwbE5LQTRZ</guid></item><item><title>减肥后皮肤松弛：专家希望你知道的事情-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/well/loose-skin-after-weight-loss.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 09:00:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE8xRnJodDZGOEdxTk1aOGpjUWlRTGF4cHJFUm14N1hSVVN2b3FFX0UzdmVXN0xnQlUteEJFYWtPbmRjcHdrT0l6TVM4bmlQNFpOV3pBbl9INWtYbGc0ak9Rd2g1Nm4wSU5QSm5SRm5qV0Jsdk9MM01HbWgtR3VpZw</guid></item><item><title>儿童疫苗接种计划的重大调整可能即将到来- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/03/childhood-vaccine-schedule-at-risk-rfk-cdc-turmoil/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts are bracing for what could be fundamental changes to childhood vaccine policies that don’t align with scientific consensus, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undergoes a major leadership shakeup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ousted CDC director Susan Monarez after she &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/cdc-director-fired-behind-the-scenes-look/"&gt;refused his demand&lt;/a&gt; to approve all recommendations made by the agency’s vaccine advisory committee, whose members were handpicked by him. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has since &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/jim-oneill-cdc-acting-director/"&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; one of his allies, former biotech investor Jim O’Neill, as acting director.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four other senior CDC leaders &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/28/profiles-cdc-officials-who-resigned-in-protest/"&gt;also resigned&lt;/a&gt;, including the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Amid the instability, experts fear that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is slated to meet on Sept. 18 and 19, could propose severe changes that limit commonly used vaccines. The committee &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-16706.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plans to discuss&lt;/a&gt; not only Covid-19 vaccines, but also other shots to protect against infectious diseases, including hepatitis B, respiratory syncytial virus, as well as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-rfk-vaccines-public-health-policy-changes/"&gt;ACIP’s last meeting&lt;/a&gt;, the first gathering of the new members chosen by Kennedy, some expressed skepticism towards vaccines, but the group did not make any recommendations that created major disruptions to the current schedule for children. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Now though, with Monarez gone, experts are concerned that members could “be very much emboldened to make more aggressive changes,” said Jose Romero, a former chair of the committee who has consulted for pharma companies on vaccine policy since leaving the committee.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not yet clear how long O’Neill will be acting director and how he will handle ACIP recommendations. He has described himself as “very strongly pro-vaccine,” but he’s also closely aligned with Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and others in the administration have argued that ACIP historically rubber-stamped vaccine decisions — although the committee did debate evidence and withhold recommendations in some cases — and that vaccine makers should face greater scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The panel’s recommendations have real-world consequences. Federal and private payers are required to make vaccines free for people if they are recommended by ACIP and adopted by the CDC. The committee also recommends which vaccines it thinks should be part of the Vaccines For Children Program, which covers the costs of vaccines and therapies for children without health insurance or on Medicaid. A little over half the nation’s children receive vaccines through the VFC program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, experts fear that the panel may restrict or roll back a recommendation that it made last meeting in support of a preventive monoclonal antibody to protect babies against RSV. Separately, they believe, members are likely to question hepatitis B shots that are given to infants at birth and that have been credited with preventing children from developing debilitating, lifelong conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s not a lot of surprise likely to loom in terms of where this committee will go in this coming meeting and going forward,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of public health at Yale University. “It will be to continue to emphasize the alleged potential harms of vaccines, to understate their value and their effectiveness, and to continue to chip away at the infrastructure for our vaccine recommendations that we’ve had for decades.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-covid-19"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration last week revoked emergency use authorizations for Covid-19 vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/27/fda-covid-vaccines-kennedy-rescinds-emergency-use-authorization/"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; narrower approvals that could make them more difficult to access, particularly for young children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Pfizer’s vaccine, developed with BioNTech, had been available to children over 6 months old under an emergency use authorization, but the latest move now restricts the shot to children older than 5. Moderna’s vaccine is available for children as young as 6 months, but only for those with an underlying health condition that puts them at higher risk of severe illness from a Covid infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and others in the administration have argued that anyone can still get Covid vaccines if they want it but that the risks of these vaccines often outweigh any demonstrable benefit five years after the outbreak of the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Experts expect that ACIP will support the FDA authorizations, which the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.” The pediatric group  &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/19/pediatrician-group-rebuffs-rfk-issues-own-vaccine-recommendations/"&gt;issued its own recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 shots should be available for all children between 6 months and 23 months, as well as children over 2 at risk for severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rsv"&gt;RSV&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting, members &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-acip-merck-rsv-monoclonal-antibody-enflonsia/"&gt;voted to recommend&lt;/a&gt; a new monoclonal antibody to protect infants from RSV, Merck’s Enflonsia. A similar product, Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s Beyfortus, has been in use since the fall of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But during the meeting, member Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, raised concern that there appeared to be more deaths in arms of clinical trials where children got the antibodies than in placebo arms. CDC and FDA staff noted that all deaths in trials are rigorously studied and researchers concluded that the deaths in these trials were not linked to the antibody. Levi nonetheless voted against recommending Enflonsia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the meeting has concluded, another ACIP member, Robert Malone, &lt;a href="https://www.malone.news/p/what-the-acip-wasnt-shown" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on his blog&lt;/a&gt; a piece by Yaffa Shir-Raz, a researcher at the University of Haifa. She argued that the presentation of data on the antibody was flawed and obscured safety risks. Jake Scott, an infectious disease specialist at Stanford University, wrote a &lt;a href="https://quillette.com/2025/08/23/a-baseless-attack-on-groundbreaking-rsv-therapies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; countering the post and explaining why the CDC’s analysis was epidemiologically sound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malone, though, said his trust in the CDC’s data presentation “appears to have been ill-advised.” He wrote that committee members had little chance to review the data ahead of the meeting, and “going forward, speaking for myself, based on these findings, I will no longer be able to trust that what is presented in CDC summaries to the ACIP is transparent, accurate, and unbiased.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malone wrote on his blog that he couldn’t discuss future ACIP plans, but experts suspect that the committee may now unwind the RSV recommendation. They fear the group may pull its backing not only for Merck’s antibody, but also for the one made by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Shir-Raz in her post suggested that “the seizure risk is likely a class effect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If ACIP does do that, “that’s a tremendous loss for children, and places their health care and their lives in jeopardy,” Romero said. Babies’ lungs are still developing and they’re most vulnerable to RSV. Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s antibody, as well as a new maternal vaccine, have been key tools to protect young children. A CDC report &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/08/cdc-report-suggests-rsv-vaccine-abrysvvo-antibody-shot-beyfortus-reduced-infant-hospitalizations/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that last winter, the first time these new measures were available, there was a substantial drop in RSV hospitalizations among babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy may support withdrawing recommendations for antibodies. When ACIP voted for Merck’s antibody in the last meeting, a CDC director had not yet been confirmed by the Senate, so it was up to Kennedy to decide whether or not to adopt the recommendation; he did not take any action. It was only after Monarez was confirmed as CDC director that she adopted it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;James Campbell, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland, said these developments are a concerning sign for how the new ACIP will overturn traditional processes as they make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Members shouldn’t have voted on the antibody in the last meeting if they felt like they needed more time to review data, because questions and disagreements should be discussed in the official public meetings with health officials and not online after the fact, he said. “It’s not fair to the American public to have that as the deliberative process to make such important decisions for our children.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hepatitis-b"&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts fear the committee will also question the first hepatitis B shot given to infants at birth before they leave the hospital, which anti-vaccine advocates have long targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff raised concerns in his opening remarks in the earlier meeting: “Is it wise to administer a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine to every newborn before leaving the hospital?” he asked. “That’s the question. Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts said that even though mothers are routinely tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy, it’s not a foolproof method. The mother’s status could change after she takes the test, and there could be documentation errors. If infants do acquire hepatitis B from their mothers, the consequences can be devastating — they are at higher risk of lifelong liver infection that may lead to liver cancer or the need for a transplant before they reach 20-years-old. There’s no cure for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The birth dose “is a way of having a complete safety net for those babies,” and there’s no safety reason to remove it, Campbell said. With the current vaccination schedule, the U.S. is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;getting close&lt;/a&gt; to entirely eliminating hepatitis B cases at birth, he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mmrv"&gt;MMRV&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the previous ACIP meeting, Kulldorff raised a concern around MMRV vaccination — that for the first dose given to children between 12 to 47 months old, the combination MMRV shot poses a higher risk of seizure compared with giving two separate shots of MMR and varicella vaccines. (The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/vacopt-factsheet-hcp.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the seizure risk for the combination shot is about 8 out of every 100,000 children, while the risk for the separate shots is about 4 out of every 100,000.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff then proposed that the MMRV combination should not be administered as the first dose for children under 47 months, since doctors can use the separate shots instead. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC already indicates that it prefers the first dose be given as two separate shots, and pediatricians already widely follow that guidance. If the ACIP committee votes to formally withdraw its recommendation for the MMRV combination shot for the first dose, the effects on real-world practice would be minimal, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They noted, though, that they’re concerned with how the seizure risk will be portrayed. “These are nuanced, complex issues, right? But if the takeaway and the headlines are — MMRV causes seizures — then I worry about the way in which the message is being conveyed,” said Scott, the infectious disease specialist at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also fears it’s only a matter of time before ACIP restricts the use of the MMRV combination shot not only for the first dose, but also for subsequent doses for which there is not an increased risk of seizures. Anything that limits vaccinations or adds complexity to vaccination schedules, he said, would be a problem, particularly as the country grapples with increasing numbers of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/measles-america-breaks-33-year-record-anti-vaccine-sentiment-key-factor-behind-outbreaks/"&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="59067cd4-22e5-4c23-823f-f76f7f1b032e"&gt;Some of the strongest, fittest people I know are in their 60s (or over), and show no signs of slowing down. Despite being in my 30s, I feel offended when people write off those who are older simply because of age; your strength and overall fitness don’t drop off a cliff just because you’ve hit a new age milestone, and for that reason, your exercise routine shouldn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a personal trainer, I encourage people to listen to their bodies and adapt their workout routines accordingly. However, I certainly don’t encourage anyone to stop lifting weights unless they have to, and Eddie Baruta, head of the gym floor at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ultimateperformance.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://ultimateperformance.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ultimate Performance&lt;/a&gt;, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="59067cd4-22e5-4c23-823f-f76f7f1b032e-2"&gt;“Thankfully, the utter BS that people in their 60s are ‘too old’ to start weight training is being dismantled,” he says. “So, too, is the misconception that in your 60s, the best way to stay fit and strong and maintain a healthy weight is to pound the treadmill seven days a week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever your gym experience, Baruta’s five exercises to build strength, muscle and power in your 60s (and beyond) are must-tries.

"You need to choose exercises that hit that sweet spot between improving your strength and minimizing your risk of injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, Baruta says to train for function, longevity and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gXCzZkyHeg2EPVV4bqTBxB" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-gXCzZkyHeg2EPVV4bqTBxB slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lifting too heavy too soon greatly increases the risk of injury, particularly as joints, tendons and connective tissue naturally become less forgiving with age,” he adds. “Instead, older adults should prioritize perfect form, controlled tempo and a full range of motion, which ensures that the right muscles are working properly. It’s not about lifting the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; weight but about lifting &lt;em&gt;well.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-prone-dumbbell-row-batman" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-prone-dumbbell-row-batman"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="fd2b7c41-3c08-45e0-a471-798a75ae1ff1"&gt;“Performing chest-supported rows helps maintain a stable torso and keeps the focus on the target muscles,” Baruta says. "This is particularly beneficial for older trainees who may have weaker spinal stabilizers or a history of lower-back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The support allows safer execution of a pulling movement, strengthening postural muscles that are essential for daily tasks like reaching, pulling and lifting, protecting the lumbar spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups: &lt;/strong&gt;Upper back (rhomboids, mid and lower traps), lats, rear deltoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="98c0d887-8db9-4705-8854-b88ffb88f226"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select your dumbbells and place them on the floor at the head of the bench.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie face down on the bench, making sure that your chin clears the top edge. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bend your legs and drive your feet into the floor. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick up the dumbbells one at a time and let your arms hang fully extended by your sides, with your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press your hips into the bench, lift your chest slightly and look at the floor just in front of you.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pinch the shoulder blades together. Keep the elbows pointed out at a 45-degree angle.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your elbows cannot travel any further back without the shoulders rotating inwards and the upper back rounding, pause for a moment and contract the upper back.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reverse the motion, under control, to the start position.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-good-morning" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-good-morning"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

It’s a movement that mimics hip-hinging tasks like picking up objects off the ground,” Baruta says. “When executed properly, it builds the hamstrings, glutes and spinal erectors, which are vital muscles for improving your posture, balance and mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups: &lt;/strong&gt;Hamstrings, glutes, lower back (spinal erectors), core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="923db8e6-0ae1-4927-8064-aa942b01e17e"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Position a barbell across your upper back, just below the base of your neck. Avoid resting it directly on your cervical spine (the neck).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a firm, even grip on the bar, keeping your elbows pointed down to create a stable “shelf” with your upper back muscles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes pointing forward (or slightly out, depending on comfort and hip mobility).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage your core, take a deep breath into your belly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a slight bend in your knees, push your hips back as if you were closing a door behind you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lean your torso forward, maintaining a flat back, until your torso is roughly parallel to the floor (or as far as your hamstring flexibility allows).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drive your hips forward and squeeze your glutes to bring your torso upright. Keep the bar stable across your back throughout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="c9a9b18a-4e7d-4f9e-b42b-54534ecc9fb4"&gt;“Don’t relax at the bottom; maintain bracing and tension in your core and lats the entire time," Baruta says. "Only lower as far as your mobility allows while keeping good form. With practice, your range will improve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3-farmer-s-walk" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-farmer-s-walk"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="29f73b77-fb05-46cd-84a2-ceca00ef3d68"&gt;“The prowler push is a dynamic full-body movement that builds strength, power and cardiovascular capacity through resisted sprinting,” Baruta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those over 60, this makes it an excellent tool for maintaining explosive lower-body strength and metabolic capacity while minimizing the risk of injury. The exercise’s emphasis on sprint-like mechanics also fosters agility and mobility, which are critical components of functionality as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target muscle groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Quadriceps and calves during sprint-style pushes. When heavy, more the glutes and posterior chain due to increased hip flexion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="d4d10215-5e65-4343-9d3e-1bf54703d0e2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grab the handles, arms bent or straight. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flex at the hip to allow enough room to push. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep the spine neutral. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Push and sprint as fast as you can. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5-seated-low-pulley-cable-row" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-seated-low-pulley-cable-row"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.

              &lt;p&gt;Normally, I’d start this sort of article by saying something along the lines of, “Everyone knows how horrible it is to feel motion sick.” But that’s not entirely true—plenty of people can text, read, and do all sorts of things in a moving vehicle without feeling the slightest bit nauseous. If that sounds like you, you’ll have to trust me—a chronic sufferer of motion sickness—when I say that it wholeheartedly sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Plus, many drugs used for motion sickness come with an unwanted side effect: drowsiness. While that’s useful for a long-haul red-eye, it definitely kills the mood on a road trip. That’s why researchers have looked into whether music can help people recover from carsickness, and they might be onto something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Motion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,” Qizong Yue, a researcher at Southwest University in China, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/03/happy-music-could-help-you-recover-from-motion-sickness-frontiers-human-neuroscience"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Music represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Simulated carsickness hell&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.163610"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Yue and colleagues induced carsickness in study participants with a driving simulator (you couldn’t pay me enough to get into that) and then played different types of music while monitoring them for potential recovery. According to their results, soft and joyful music best supported recovery. Perhaps surprisingly, even sad music was worse than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team divided the 30 participants, who had reported moderate levels of previous carsickness, into six groups—four who listened to music as they recovered from motion sickness, one who didn’t, and one whose simulations stopped before the participant became carsick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wore &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875"&gt;electroencephalogram&lt;/a&gt; (EEG) caps—tools that measure electrical activity in the brain. The researchers hoped to identify brain signals indicative of carsickness by comparing the neural activity of the first five groups with that of the sixth group—the one for which the simulation stopped before participants could become nauseous (ok, maybe you could pay me to be in group six).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers first measured each participant’s EEG signals as they sat still in the simulator. The participants subsequently underwent a driving task and communicated their level of carsickness. At the end of the task, some participants listened to music for 60 seconds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team then asked them how carsick they still were. The participants reported that joyful music reduced carsickness by 57.3%, soft music reduced it by 56.7%, and passionate music by 48.3%. While those who didn’t listen to music reported 43.3% fewer carsickness symptoms after the 60 seconds, participants who listened to sad music reported a reduction of just 40%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that soft music might relax tensions that worsen carsickness, and joyful music may provide a distraction by triggering brain reward systems. Sad music could aggravate negative feelings and, as a result, worsen a person’s general discomfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Your brain when you’re motion sick&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the EEG data revealed changes in participants’ occipital lobe brain activity when they said they were carsick. Specifically, the device recorded less complex activity when participants reported feeling significantly nauseous. As they recovered, brain activity in this area gradually returned to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Based on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,” Yue explained. “The primary theoretical frameworks for motion sickness genesis apply broadly to sickness induced by various vehicles. Therefore, the findings of this study likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, “the primary limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size,” the researcher added. “This constraint results in limited statistical power.” What’s more, one’s brain might react differently to a simulation than real-life conditions. In other words, more research with larger samples is needed to confirm both the carsickness brain activity patterns and to continue investigating the impact of music on motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the team will study different types of motion sickness and the influence of music taste. And if any of the researchers are reading this article, I’d like to suggest investigating the anecdotal evidence of how singing helps prevent and/or recover from motion sickness. It would finally prove to my family that I literally &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to belt out the lyrics to all of Taylor Swift’s songs when we hit those windy roads.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, health authorities have warned against red meat consumption, with the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172897" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; research arm classifying it as "probably carcinogenic to humans". But a controversial &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; challenges that position, suggesting that animal protein might protect against cancer deaths rather than cause them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://monographs.iarc.who.int/agents-classified-by-the-iarc/"&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)&lt;/a&gt;, part of the WHO, has long classified red meat, including beef, pork, lamb and mutton, as probably carcinogenic. And processed meats such as bacon and sausages are classified as definite carcinogens. This judgment reflects multiple studies linking red meat to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01646-1"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;, forming the basis of dietary advice to limit intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the new research by Canada's McMaster University suggests the opposite: that people who consume more animal protein may actually have &lt;a href="https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/apnm-2023-0594"&gt;lower cancer mortality rates&lt;/a&gt;. But, before you rush out to buy a pack of sausages, there are some important points you should note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's methods contain important nuances that complicate its &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/eating-meat-could-protect-against-cancer-related-death-study-suggests"&gt;headline-grabbing conclusions&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than examining red meat specifically, the researchers analysed consumption of "animal protein", a broad category that &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/11/1771"&gt;includes red meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. This distinction matters significantly because fish, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/3/640"&gt;oily varieties such as mackerel and sardines&lt;/a&gt;, are associated with being cancer-protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By grouping all animal proteins together, the study may have captured the protective effects of fish and certain dairy products rather than proving the safety of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dairy products themselves present a complex picture in cancer research. Some studies suggest they &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322002095?via%3Dihub"&gt;reduce colorectal cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; while potentially &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/association-between-dairy-products-consumption-and-prostate-cancer-risk-a-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/ADBD3EA24DE6E07CE23E0F110012916C"&gt;increasing prostate cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;. This mixed evidence underscores how the broad "animal protein" category obscures important distinctions between different food types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the &lt;a href="https://www.ncba.org/"&gt;National Cattlemen's Beef Association&lt;/a&gt;, America's primary beef industry lobbying group, contains several other limitations. Crucially, the researchers didn't distinguish between processed and unprocessed meats – a distinction that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01635580701684872"&gt;countless studies have shown to be vital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats such as bacon, sausages and deli meats consistently show higher cancer risks than fresh, unprocessed cuts. Additionally, the research didn't examine specific cancer types, making it impossible to determine whether the protective effects apply broadly or to particular cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also examined plant proteins, including legumes, nuts and soy products such as tofu, and found they had no strong protective effect against dying of cancer. This finding contradicts previous research suggesting that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13668-025-00688-3#Sec11"&gt;plant proteins are linked to decreased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;, adding another layer of complexity to an already confusing picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings don't diminish the established health benefits of plant-based foods, which provide fibre, antioxidants and other compounds associated with reduced disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg" alt="salad with numerous items" class="wp-image-151583 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/salad_with_many_plants_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151583" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new study doesn't undermine the wealth of evidence that plant-based foods are good for you.

Excessive red meat intake remains linked to other serious health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.imrpress.com/journal/IJVNR/85/1-2/10.1024/0300-9831/a000224"&gt;heart disease and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. The key lies in moderation and balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflicting research highlights the complexity of nutrition science, where isolating the effects of individual foods proves remarkably difficult. People don't eat single nutrients in isolation – they consume complex combinations of foods as part of broader lifestyle patterns. It's more important to focus on overall dietary patterns rather than fixating on individual foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/12/1947"&gt;balanced plate approach&lt;/a&gt;, featuring a variety of protein sources, plenty of vegetables and fruits, and minimally processed foods, remains the most evidence-based path to optimal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this latest study adds a new dimension to the meat debate, it's unlikely to be the final word. As nutrition science continues to evolve, the most prudent approach remains the least dramatic: moderation, variety and balance in all things.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264088/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Researchers have developed plant-based microbeads that block fat absorption in the gut.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current strategies for weight loss, such as gastric bypass surgery or medications that block fat absorption, often come with significant risks or unpleasant side effects. Scientists are now exploring a different option: edible microbeads made from green tea polyphenols, vitamin E, and seaweed. Once swallowed, these beads attach to dietary fats inside the digestive tract. Early studies in rats that were fed high-fat diets suggest this method could provide a safer and more widely available alternative to traditional surgery or drug-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yue Wu, a graduate student at Sichuan University, is scheduled to present the team’s findings at the ACS Fall 2025 Digital Meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing weight can help some people prevent long-term health issues like diabetes and heart disease,” says Wu. “Our microbeads work directly in the gut to block fat absorption in a noninvasive and gentle way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Challenge of Fat Absorption&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight gain can be influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors, one of the most important being diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a high-fat diet is defined as one in which 35% or more of daily calories come from fat rather than protein or carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some approved drugs, such as orlistat, reduce fat absorption by interfering with the enzymes that break down dietary fats. While effective, orlistat has been linked to serious side effects in certain patients, including damage to the liver and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Wu and her colleagues wanted to target the fat absorption process with their weight-loss intervention but do so without negative side effects. “We want to develop something that works with how people normally eat and live,” says Wu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490711" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490711" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490711" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-777x777.jpg" alt="Fat Trapping Microbeads" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-777x777.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-400x400.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-150x150.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-768x768.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-450x450.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-1200x1201.jpg 1200w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Fat-Trapping-Microbeads-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490711" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;These plant-based microbeads absorb and trap fat. Credit: Yue Wu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get started, the team created tiny plant-based beads that spontaneously form through a series of chemical bonds between the green tea polyphenols and vitamin E. These structures can form chemical tethers to fat droplets and serve as the fat-binding core of the microbeads. The researchers then coated the spheres in a natural polymer derived from seaweed to protect them from the acidic environment of the stomach. Once ingested, the protective polymer coating expands in response to the acidic pH, and the green tea polyphenols and vitamin E compounds bind to and trap partially digested fats in the intestine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Integrating Microbeads into Diets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microbeads are nearly flavorless, and the researchers foresee them being easily integrated into people’s diets. For example, the microbeads could be made into small tapioca- or boba-sized balls and added to desserts and bubble teas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed the microbeads as a weight-loss treatment in rats. They put the animals into three groups (eight rats per group), those which were fed a high-fat diet (60% fats) either with or without microbeads and those which were fed a normal diet (10% fats) for 30 days. Rats fed the high-fat diet and microbeads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lost 17% of their total body weight, while rats in the other groups didn’t lose weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Had reduced adipose tissue and less liver damage compared to rats fed the high-fat and normal diets without microbeads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excreted more fat in their feces compared to rats not given microbeads. The extra fat in the rats’ feces had no apparent ill effects on the animals’ health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the eight rats on high-fat diets that consumed microbeads showed similar intestinal fat excretion, but without the gastrointestinal side effects the researchers observed with a fourth group of rats they treated with orlistat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu and her team have started working with a biotechnology company to manufacture the plant-based beads. “All the ingredients are food grade and FDA-approved, and their production can be easily scaled up,” says Yunxiang He, Sichuan University associate professor and co-author on Wu’s presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’ve also initiated a human clinical trial in collaboration with the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. “This represents a major step toward clinical translation of our polyphenol-based microbeads, following our foundational results,” says Wu. “We have officially enrolled 26 participants in our investigator-initiated trial, and we anticipate that preliminary data may become available within the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;They have been promoted as a remedy for anxiety and sleeplessness, with &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlskNOvFJQW/?taken-by=myblanquil"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; and influencers swearing by their calming effects. Weighted blankets – heavy throws filled with glass beads or plastic pellets – have gone from a niche therapeutic tool to a mainstream wellness must-have, promising better sleep and reduced stress for anyone struggling to unwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do they deliver on these bold claims, or are we simply paying premium prices for an expensive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weighted-blankets-really-can-do-wonders-for-a-good-nights-sleep"&gt;Weighted Blankets Really Can Do Wonders For a Good Night's Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapists have used weighted blankets since the 1970s to help children with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and adults with sensory processing disorders. They became commercially available in the 1990s, but remained largely within special needs communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed dramatically in recent years when companies began targeting what they call the "casually anxious" – essentially, anyone struggling with modern life's stresses. The marketing worked: Time magazine even named the weighted blanket one of the &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2018/5454469/gravity-blanket/"&gt;top 50 "inventions" of 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept behind weighted blankets is appealingly simple. Typically weighing between two and 13 kilograms (experts &lt;a href="https://www.hollandandbarrett.com/the-health-hub/conditions/sleep/sleep-help/how-do-weighted-blankets-work/"&gt;recommend choosing one that's 10% of your body weight&lt;/a&gt;), they use what occupational therapists call "deep pressure stimulation". The gentle, even pressure across your body mimics the sensation of being held or hugged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the science says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research picture is more nuanced than the marketing suggests. Several studies do show promising results, but with important qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7970589/"&gt;study of 120 psychiatric outpatients&lt;/a&gt; found that weighted blankets improved insomnia symptoms over four weeks in people with major  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, bipolar disorder, anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded they were "a safe and effective intervention for insomnia in patients with some mental health disorders".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller studies have shown similar patterns. One found that &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J004v24n01_05"&gt;63% of adults reported lower anxiety&lt;/a&gt; after just five minutes under a weighted blanket, while another study of psychiatric inpatients found &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0164212X.2015.1066220"&gt;60% experienced reduced anxiety&lt;/a&gt; during their hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these studies all focused on people with diagnosed mental health conditions, not the general population that companies are now targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the science diverges from the marketing: reviews of the research consistently show that benefits for healthy people are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38686123/"&gt;much harder to prove&lt;/a&gt;. While weighted blankets may help people with clinical anxiety or sleep disorders, there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39341068/"&gt;insufficient evidence&lt;/a&gt; that they benefit casual users without existing mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, about half the research on weighted blankets &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32204779/"&gt;doesn't meet quality standards&lt;/a&gt; for robust scientific evidence – a significant problem given the confident health claims found on product websites and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a28713038/weighted-blanket-health-benefits/"&gt;glowing reviews&lt;/a&gt; in lifestyle magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who might benefit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean weighted blankets are entirely useless for healthy people. Shift workers, who must sleep during daylight hours when their brains are naturally alert, might find them helpful for combating the known health effects of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/shift-work-can-harm-sleep-and-health-what-helps-202302282896"&gt;irregular schedules&lt;/a&gt;. Healthcare workers, firefighters and pilots who rely on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37061-9"&gt;strategic power naps&lt;/a&gt; could benefit from faster sleep onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placebo effect also shouldn't be dismissed. If a weighted blanket helps you feel calmer and sleep better, even if the mechanism isn't what manufacturers claim, that's still a positive outcome, provided you understand what you're buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weighted blankets do carry some risks. They shouldn't be used by anyone who cannot easily move beneath their weight, including young children. People with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="172882" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, asthma, sleep apnoea, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/"&gt;COPD&lt;/a&gt;, circulation problems, high blood pressure or claustrophobia should consult their GP before opting to use one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No studies have reported serious harms, but common sense suggests checking with a healthcare provider if you have underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a low-risk intervention that might complement &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10105495/"&gt;good sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/benefits-of-sleep"&gt;regular sleep cycles&lt;/a&gt;, weighted blankets aren't inherently problematic. The issue lies in overselling their capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're considering buying one, be realistic about your expectations. You're not buying a miracle cure for modern anxiety but rather a potentially comforting sleep aid that might help you feel more settled at bedtime. For many people struggling with sleep, that gentle pressure and sense of security could be worth the investment, even if the science behind it isn't quite as solid as the marketing suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real question isn't whether weighted blankets work, but whether they work for you, and whether the premium price is justified for what might ultimately be an expensive hug.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263591/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A 70-year-old woman became the first in Massachusetts to test positive for West Nile virus this year, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-human-case-of-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman was exposed to the disease in Middlesex County, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department did not disclose details about specifically where or when the woman was exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mosquito-borne virus can be transmitted to humans through mosquito bites, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first mosquitos positive for West Nile virus were &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/07/13/west-nile-virus-detected-in-two-boston-mosquito-samples/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; June 17, found in Boston’s West Roxbury and Hyde Park neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/08/13/the-risk-for-west-nile-virus-is-now-high-in-10-mass-communities-heres-what-to-know/"&gt;warned residents&lt;/a&gt; in early August about the rise of the virus, declaring the risk to be “high” in 10 Massachusetts communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current risk for the virus is high in 10 municipalities in Suffolk and Middlesex counties, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season, there have been 319 West Nile-positive mosquito samples so far, the department said. In July, a goat in Lunenburg was the first animal to be infected with the virus in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “While September brings cooler air and the return to school for many in the state, the risk from WNV is going to be elevated for some time. Residents should continue to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites,” said Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/health/2025/07/13/west-nile-virus-detected-in-two-boston-mosquito-samples/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; residents to be wary of the mosquitos, and take proper precautions like applying insect repellent when outdoors, draining standing water, and installing or repairing window screens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The mosquitoes will be with us until the first hard frost,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Catherine M. Brown. “People should use mosquito repellent with an EPA-registered active ingredient, clothing to reduce exposed skin, and consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during the evening or early morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-public-health-officials-announce-seasons-first-west-nile-virus-positive-mosquito-sample-0"&gt;19 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in 2024 and &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/state-health-officials-announce-risk-level-changes-for-west-nile-virus-in-massachusetts"&gt;six cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, according to the department.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A protein called ferritin light chain 1 (FTL1) may play a significant role in brain aging, a new study reveals, giving scientists a new target for understanding and potentially preventing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-rapidly-aged-in-the-pandemic-and-it-wasnt-just-the-virus"&gt;brain deterioration&lt;/a&gt; and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTL1 was brought to light through a careful comparison of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; part of the brain in mice of different ages. The hippocampus is involved in memory and learning, and it is one of the regions that suffers most from age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team found that FLT1 was the one protein in this region that old mice had more of and young mice had less of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by a team from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and the researchers are hopeful that their findings will enlighten human treatments for neurodegenerative conditions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-brain-scan-halfway-through-your-life-can-reveal-how-fast-youre-aging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Single Brain Scan Halfway Through Your Life Can Reveal How Fast You're Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FTL1 is known to be related to storing iron in the body, but hasn't come up in relation to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live"&gt;brain aging&lt;/a&gt; before. To test its involvement after their initial findings, the researchers used genetic editing to overexpress the protein in young mice, and reduce its level in old mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172283" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons.jpg" alt="Cultured neurons" class="wp-image-172283 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BrainNeurons-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172283" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neurons with a lot of FTL1 (right) had fewer branching arms, a sign of lower connectivity. (Remesal et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: the younger mice showed signs of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;impaired memory&lt;/a&gt; and learning abilities, as if they were getting old before their time, while in the older mice there were signs of restored cognitive function – some of the brain aging was effectively reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves, this has only been demonstrated in mouse models, and there's a lot of work to do before this can be confirmed in people, but the early signs are promising when it comes to keeping older brains in a healthier state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is truly a reversal of impairments," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Saul Villeda, from UCSF. "It's much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests on cells in petri dishes showed how FTL1 stopped neurons from growing properly, with neural wires lacking the branching structures that typically provide links between nerve cells and improve brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the analysis carried out by the researchers, it seems that increased FTL1 may interfere with the mitochondria that act as the power stations of our cells. Mitochondria are closely &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2016.01.028"&gt;linked to aging&lt;/a&gt; – it's as if they're light bulbs that get dimmer and dimmer as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the difficulty in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds"&gt;studying aging&lt;/a&gt; is picking apart which changes in the body are the result of aging, and which changes might be driving it. Through the collection of tests run here, it seems FTL1 is one of those drivers – at least in the hippocampuses of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research can now look at how this might be applied to people, and possibly neurodegenerative diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="172280" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-parkinsons-gene-discovery-sheds-light-on-evolutionary-origin"&gt;and Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. It's also going to be important to find out more about how FTL1 affects the brain, and what the full set of consequences of limiting it might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Villeda. "It's a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-025-00940-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The digestive process of cabbage slows down sugar absorption into the bloodstream, which stops blood sugar levels from increasing after meals. The antioxidants in cabbage work to combat inflammation, and assist with weight management. Diabetic patients can safely eat cabbage through raw salads, curries and by fermenting it into sauerkraut or cooking it in soups and stews, because it contains very few carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This article contains only information and should not replace professional medical guidance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在中型试验中，非处方鼻喷雾剂似乎将新冠病毒感染率降低了67% - ARS Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/09/otc-nasal-spray-seemed-to-cut-covid-infections-by-67-in-mid-sized-trial/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;COVID context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all trials, there are limitations. As mentioned, the number of infections here is small—the impressive efficacy numbers could potentially vanish in a larger trial with more infections. And, while the trial had a high-quality design, it was undertaken in just one location in Germany and mostly involved healthy white women between the ages of 20 and 46, so the findings are not generalizable. The study was also funded by a pharmaceutical company that makes an azelastine nasal spray (though not the one that is sold over the counter in the US).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, with the previous studies, the trial offers some hope that this accessible nasal spray could be used as a viral prophylactic for respiratory seasons in the future. And the results land at a time when access to COVID-19 vaccines—which have firmly proven to be safe and highly effective—has been severely restricted in the US by health secretary and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, it appears that only people ages 65 and over, and those at higher risk of COVID-19 will have access to the shots this year, though some aspects of that access are murky, including how people will prove they're at high risk. For healthy children, teens, and adults under 65, there may be no access or extremely limited access. That includes groups that medical experts recommend get vaccinated, namely healthy pregnant people and children ages 6 months to 23 months, both of which are considered at high risk from COVID-19 by medical experts, but not federal guidance under Kennedy. Experts also recommend access for healthy people who have contact with vulnerable people, such as cancer doctors, people who live with immunocompromised family members, and people who work in nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With limited vaccine access and the normal slew of respiratory viruses on the horizon, a simple nasal spray is an appealing addition to the defenses. The main side effects are fairly minor, including bitter taste in the mouth, nosebleeds, and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;


          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis cases are on the rise in Maine and across the country, although there are no current outbreaks in the state, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Hammes, spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/tuberculosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Maine CDC&lt;/a&gt;, said the agency is “aware of three active TB cases with links to the Greater Portland area and is in the midst of conducting our typical response.” She said that, so far, the cases are not genetically linked, meaning they were not transmitted from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammes said the CDC is also identifying people who were in close contact with the three people who had contracted TB and screening them if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City and state officials said rumors of an outbreak at the Portland shelter for asylum seekers are untrue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection of the lungs that can spread person to person, but it’s far less contagious than other diseases like influenza and COVID-19. TB can be treated with a course of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases have been increasing in recent years in Maine and across the nation. There had been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/national.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;28 cases in the state so far this year through the end of July,&lt;/a&gt; according to the Maine CDC. The state had 26 TB cases for all of 2023 and 39 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, tuberculosis cases have risen since 2021, with 10,347 cases reported in 2024, up from 9,622 in 2023, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency has attributed the rise to increases in international travel, migration and disruptions in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic leading to delayed diagnosis and care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While mortality rates are low and falling in the U.S., it’s still a deadly disease in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, 10.8 million people were infected with TB in 2023 and 1.25 million people died, according to the World Health Organization. That was the most recent year statistics were available from the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease can be spread when a person is near an infected person who has active tuberculosis and breathes the bacteria into their lungs. TB is not spread by sharing utensils, clothing or food, and is not sexually transmitted or through blood, according to the U.S. CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth, said that while TB is contagious, people need to be in “close, prolonged contact” with someone with an active case to be at risk of becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of people do not need to worry about this,” Mills said. “It’s not spread through casual contact like shaking hands or sharing a towel. It’s much less contagious than influenza or COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living in crowded places, like homeless shelters, jails and prisons, are more at risk, Mills said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of tuberculosis can include a cough that lasts more than three weeks, coughing up blood or phlegm, unexplained weight loss, night sweats and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a TB vaccine, although the vaccine is not usually given in the U.S. because of the low risk of contracting the disease in the country, the high number of false positive tests after administering the vaccine and because the vaccine is not as effective in adults when compared to children, according to the U.S. CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;

Another patient would go to Bronson QuickCare Plus for stitches and treatments for broken bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No services will change, but accessing the correct form of care is expected to improve, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recognized that there is some need to better understand the levels of care and where to obtain that care," Padgett told News Channel 3. "So, really, where do you go? What's your best walk-in option? And we recognize that with the different locations, names, it was confusing. So, we listened to that feedback and wanted to help our patients understand how to make this easier for them to make that decision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost is an important factor for many patients. According to officials, the walk-ins' new names will help patients better understand how much they'll be billed when they go to the right place for the correct care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to do everything we can to help those patients understand their options and what to expect when they receive their bill," Padgett said. "So, launching this advertising campaign, getting in what we're looking, you'll see more of is trying to educate on the different real life health scenarios and where to go to get that care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients confused about their billing can contact Bronson Healthcare's 24/7 care advisor line at 269-341-7788.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WWMT</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:56:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6gFBVV95cUxNVmJXcTh4SnZ3LTIxa1BMNlpic3dhZ1VzWjEwa0ZYNHhBYmpWNmlRUnU2eDdWODNzcXJDdlpUQ0ZoSWRXblBKMERrRXZDM25xWHMxMVpnaHhJX0lJY3FYV2FVLTJPTndvc19JM3Ryd0NuekJ6SjBkSER5dmlFQVg2UTk1UkVjUGxSSG5La1hnaURIU2s3akVuc0pMUUQ4ZmVFaHF4amE3VnBxLXkwZVA2MlBhcENsOXEwdmpwcDRRMGNlMzJ0ZkpWRHFMTVg3T1dYUjV2WnBNN0dvQlMtalFCYnQwMzRURmxUQUE</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州新冠肺炎疫情飙升：新型“Stratus”变种的注意事项-达拉斯新闻</title><link>https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/09/02/covid-19-surges-in-texas-what-to-know-about-new-stratus-variant/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Cases of &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/covid-19/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/topic/covid-19/"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; are spiking in Texas as a new variant spreads across much of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;COVID variant XFG, nicknamed Stratus, accounts for three-fourths of COVID cases in the U.S., according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/variants/variants-and-genomic-surveillance.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

Nearly 18% of tests reported to the CDC from Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas and Louisiana were positive for COVID. A breakdown by individual states was not available, but the positivity rate nationwide is only 11.2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Cases are likely far higher because many people test at home and do not report the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__sI3E3 p-7 mb-6 w-full h-64 border-t border-b border-black flex flex-col gap-7"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__2nIGz flex items-center justify-center gap-x-7"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__VBR0d flex-auto w-full flex flex-col"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__jO6ca secondaryBold secondaryBold-8 text-center"&gt;D-FW Public Health Alerts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__3beff secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-20 text-center text-gray-dark"&gt;Get the latest public health updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__WpP95 flex flex-col gap-7 items-center"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__8MgJa flex flex-wrap text-gray-dark secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-20 text-center justify-center"&gt;By signing up, you agree to our &lt;a class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__lU9-l border-b border-gray-dark hover_border-0 focus_border-0 active_border-0" href="/help/terms-of-service/"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="dmnc_features-cta-social-article-cta-social-module__lU9-l border-b border-gray-dark hover_border-0 focus_border-0 active_border-0" href="/help/privacy-policy"&gt;Privacy Policy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services Director &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2020/04/09/meet-dr-philip-huang-the-lake-highlands-grad-who-is-helping-direct-how-dallas-county-responds-to-the-coronavirus/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2020/04/09/meet-dr-philip-huang-the-lake-highlands-grad-who-is-helping-direct-how-dallas-county-responds-to-the-coronavirus/"&gt;Dr. Philip Huang&lt;/a&gt; said Tuesday that all five wastewater monitoring sites in Dallas County have shown recent increases in COVID. Because case reporting for COVID is no longer mandated, monitoring largely relies on wastewater testing and lab reports from hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;While the rate of COVID is not near the critical levels seen at the height of the pandemic, Huang said residents should take precautions to prevent spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Definitely we’re concerned about it, especially for those populations that are most vulnerable, the older populations and those with underlying health conditions,” Huang said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms of Stratus include congestion, cough, fever, runny nose, fatigue and muscle aches, similar to previous variants. In a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released in June, the World Health Organization says it is monitoring the strain but that it does not appear to pose an additional public health threat compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Stratus recently surpassed the variant Nimbus, better known by its catchier moniker &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/06/18/new-covid-variant-nimbus-can-cause-razor-blade-throat-what-to-know/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/06/18/new-covid-variant-nimbus-can-cause-razor-blade-throat-what-to-know/"&gt;“razor blade throat,”&lt;/a&gt; named for the excruciating pain it causes. Patients have likened the sensation to swallowing razor blades or shards of glass. The variant is still spreading, accounting for 14% of cases, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-text-header"&gt;Confusion over vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The spike in cases comes as widespread confusion about who will be eligible to get a vaccine this fall is growing. In May, U.S. Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/27/covid-vaccines-no-longer-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced&lt;/a&gt; that COVID vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move questioned by some public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/20/new-federal-rules-for-covid-boosters-could-delay-shots-for-healthy-adults-kids/" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/05/20/new-federal-rules-for-covid-boosters-could-delay-shots-for-healthy-adults-kids/"&gt;Food and Drug Administration provided new requirements&lt;/a&gt; for the shots, saying the vaccine would be available to adults 65 and older and children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/27/fda-approves-updated-covid-19-shots-but-limits-access-for-some-kids-and-adults/"&gt;U.S. regulators announced that new shots&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax are approved for all seniors. But the Food and Drug Administration narrowed its use for younger adults and children to those with at least one high-risk health condition, such as asthma or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/20/covid-shots-for-kids-still-recommended-by-us-pediatric-group-in-break-with-cdc/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/08/20/covid-shots-for-kids-still-recommended-by-us-pediatric-group-in-break-with-cdc/"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics is still calling for COVID shots &lt;/a&gt;for healthy children beginning at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Until recently, the U.S. — following guidance from independent experts who advise the CDC — has recommended annual COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;But Kennedy fired every member of that Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices earlier this year. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccine-advisers-covid19-rsv-a85baa8a9296fd857af5ce33ae3b6cfd" rel=""&gt;The replacements&lt;/a&gt; he selected have yet to make new recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Approved COVID vaccines are expected to remain effective against both the Stratus and Nimbus variants, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Dallas County has ordered the updated COVID vaccine but is waiting on delivery from the state, Huang told county commissioners. The county has set up &lt;a href="https://www.dallascounty.org/departments/dchhs/clinical-services/immunization-clinics.php" rel=""&gt;Community Vaccine Clinics&lt;/a&gt; where residents can get COVID, flu and RSV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:53:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOUU1TbHBXXzdxRURxY3lRLS0tRHFlcHBTa2JHR1h6OUxIbjNScDROaHRLVFJKcVVIX1k5MjhRRWwxOHEyemFkcVRDaXZidVdEbUMyZlpEWWozRHB4bVJNakxYWVJOcmxZVGc1WVl1M09zX2pYV2VoNklnWDRsVFdSTkJxMkR0cTllNkZpMnc3YXhjbEJpZG45TjlTNTBLMENmUGdhQV9SU21nYXpVMWlPM2Z1TnF4SnFBVHNERkhR</guid></item><item><title>医生发现了新的潜在治疗方法，可以治疗让患者双手疼痛感冒的病症-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15058391/Doctors-discover-new-potential-treatment-condition-leaves-sufferers-hands-painfully-cold.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have identified a possible cure for a condition that causes chronic cold hands and blights hundreds of millions of people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's - estimated to impact up to five percent of adults worldwide, including up to 30 million Americans - causes miniature spasms in the blood vessels in the fingers, toes, ears or nose, which in turn cuts off the blood supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is the body's response to cold temperatures in which smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin constrict dramatically and limit blood supply to certain areas of the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sufferers often go numb in these areas as the blood is limited and skin turns white. During severe attacks, Raynaud's can cause extremely painful symptoms, and even painful sores or tissue death (gangrene) in the affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no known cure for Raynaud's, doctors at Yubei District People's Hospital in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-e071b5b0-8813-11f0-9002-d369dead878b"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; have reported how a minimally invasive surgery could hold the key to keeping symptoms at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/948422"&gt;They detail a case&lt;/a&gt; involving a 67-year-old female patient with a 10-year history of Raynaud's who was admitted to the hospital as her condition worsened and led to gangrene in her right index and middle fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help alleviate the symptoms, the doctors performed a periosteal distraction osteogenesis (PDO), a minimally invasive operation to stimulate the growth of new bone in areas that have sustained bone loss, which can occur in very severe cases of Raynaud's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure involves separating the membrane covering a bone to create a gap. This then allows new bone to form in the gap to repair any bone defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Raynaud's - estimated to impact up to 5 percent of adults worldwide - causes miniature spasms in the blood vessels, cutting off the blood supply to the fingers and toes (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often used to treat diabetic foot ulcers and bone loss by promoting the formation of new blood vessels and bone regeneration, leading to improved healing rates and a reduced need for amputations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this case, the medical team at Yubei District People's Hospital decided to apply the treatment to the female patient's hand to treat her gangrene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gangrene occurs when the blood supply to a certain area of the body is interrupted, usually through an injury or infection, and flesh begins to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anonymous case study was also suffering from 'hand ischemia', a condition where blood flow to the hands is reduced or blocked, leading to tissue damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After undergoing a PDO, the doctors reported that the patient's gangrene 'gradually progressively healed', and the pain in both hands caused by the Raynaud's 'markedly diminished.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed a PDO could work for Raynaud's as it promotes blood vessels to heal and this could prevent spasms from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could also help heal bone loss when the condition progresses. Bone loss associated with Raynaud's is known as acro-osteolysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded: 'This report supports recent studies that have shown the potential for periosteal distraction osteogenesis in the management of cases of severe and irreversible Raynaud disease of the digits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More research is being done around Raynaud's and scientists recently discovered a link between the condition and two gene mutations  - one linked to stress and the other to embryo development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers in the UK and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-3ac79a90-691a-11ee-86b3-2b7100f3870f"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; carried out the largest genetic study of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They used electronic medical records from the UK Biobank, a database containing genetic and health information from 439,294 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team identified 5,147 people diagnosed with Raynaud's and discovered a variation in two genes that predisposed people to the syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One variation was the alpha-2A-adrenergic receptor for adrenaline, or ADRA2A. This is a stress receptor that causes the small blood vessels to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;It is the body's response to cold temperatures in which smaller arteries that supply blood to the skin constrict dramatically and limit blood supply to certain areas of the body - most commonly the fingers, but sometimes also the toes, ears, and tip of the nose &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Raynaud's affects women more than men, appears most frequently between the ages of 15 to 30 years old and having a parent, sibling or child with the syndrome appears to increase the risk of primary Raynaud's&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second variation was the IRX1, a type of protein shown to be involved in early embryo development and cellular differentiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers discovered a potential benefit of using the antidepressant medication mirtazapine to treat Raynaud's, as it inhibits the function of ADRA2A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it has not yet been proven safe or effective for this use through clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers were able to replicate some of their findings using data from people of British Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found people with a genetic predisposition to low blood sugar levels have an increased risk of the syndrome, suggesting people should avoid long periods of low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers' findings help to understand, for the first time, why the small vessels react so strongly in patients, even without external stimuli like exposure to cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two main types of Raynaud's: primary and secondary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary is the most common and is not a result of a medical condition a person may have and can be so mild a person may not need treatment. It also may go away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As Raynaud's symptoms first appear, fingers will turn white as blood flow is restricted. As the tissues lose oxygen, fingers will turn a bluish hue.

It is less common than primary but often more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthcare experts have identified potential lifestyle and medical causes of the disease, which can include smoking, certain medications, connective tissue diseases, diseases of the arteries and carpal tunnel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They've also identified risk factors, including age, sex, climate and family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's affects women more than men, appears most frequently between the ages of 15 to 30 years old and having a parent, sibling or child with the syndrome appears to increase the risk of primary Raynaud's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Raynaud's symptoms first appear, fingers will turn white as blood flow is restricted. As the tissues lose oxygen, fingers will turn a bluish hue. As blood flow returns, fingers turn red and people may experience tingling, swelling and/or painful throbbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As there is no cure or current treatment for the syndrome, the goal is to manage the symptoms by reducing their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-e8d93a50-8810-11f0-9002-d369dead878b"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox health art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-f37642f0-0dac-11e8-8d90-317dbab06c13" data-permabox-url="/news/fb-5372739/What-Raynauds-disease.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's condition, triggered by drops in temperature or an increase in stress, causes the blood vessels in the fingers and toes contract, cutting off blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also affect the tiny arteries in the nose, ears and tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Raynaud's causes the fingers or toes to turn white and numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, as the blood flow returns, they turn blue and eventually red, accompanied by a burning sensation. Attacks can last from a few minutes to an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine out of ten cases are in women, with most sufferers having their first attack before the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although attacks peak in the cold winter months, symptoms can be triggered by everyday tasks such as taking food out of the freezer, air conditioning, or even stress — all of which cause blood vessels to contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most patients can cope by wrapping up warm, although some develop painful weeping ulcers, which can become infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although Raynaud's is common, only a small number of patients go on to develop a more serious connective tissue disease called scleroderma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can cause disability and can be life-threatening, which is why it is important to be diagnosed early on so any complications of the condition can be properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Raynaud's has a straightforward treatment and can be temporarily cured with a drug called nifedipine which relaxes the muscles of your heart and blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:51:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>3分钟脑电波测试在症状出现前数年检测阿尔茨海默氏症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/alzheimers-brainwave-test-neurology-29655/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A team of researchers has developed a simple three-minute brainwave test called Fastball EEG that can detect early signs of memory impairment linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Unlike traditional memory tests, it is passive and requires no active participation, making it more objective and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed Fastball could be successfully used outside clinical settings, including in people’s homes, opening the door for wider use in GP surgeries and memory clinics. This breakthrough offers a practical and affordable way to diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier, just as new treatments are becoming available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifies memory issues years before standard clinical diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Works reliably at home and in non-clinical settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Enables earlier use of breakthrough Alzheimer’s drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Bath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A simple brainwave test developed at the University of Bath has been shown to detect signs of memory impairment linked to Alzheimer’s disease years before clinical diagnosis is typically possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt; the study by academics from the University of Bath and the University of Bristol, reports that Fastball EEG, a three-minute passive test that records electrical activity in the brain while participants view a stream of images, can reliably identify memory problems in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) – a condition that can lead to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This follows the group’s previous study in 2021 that demonstrated Fastball was sensitive to memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the research team has demonstrated for the first time that the test can be administered in people’s homes, outside of a clinical environment. Researchers say this opens the door to wider screening and monitoring using accessible, low-cost technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the development of the breakthrough Alzheimer’s drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, an early diagnosis is more important than ever before. The drugs are clinically proven to be the most effective in the early stages of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite this, in England, it is estimated that as many as 1 in 3 people do not currently have a dementia diagnosis, delaying treatments, support and research opportunities to tackle the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Dr George Stothart, a cognitive neuroscientist in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath. He said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re missing the first 10 to 20 years of Alzheimer’s with current diagnostic tools. Fastball offers a way to change that – detecting memory decline far earlier and more objectively, using a quick and passive test.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the test works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fastball is a passive EEG test that monitors the brain’s automatic responses to images – without requiring participants to follow instructions or recall information. This makes it more objective and accessible than traditional memory tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detected early memory issues in people with MCI likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delivered reliable results in real-world home settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Showed reduced memory responses even in patients who later progressed to dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say Fastball could be scaled for use in GP surgeries, memory clinics, or at home – helping deliver earlier, more accurate diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Stothart added: “There’s an urgent need for accurate, practical tools to diagnose Alzheimer’s at scale. Fastball is cheap, portable, and works in real-world settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the Academy of Medical Sciences and supported by dementia research charity BRACE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Wiliams, CEO of BRACE Dementia Research, said: “Fastball is an incredible tool that could offer anyone who, for whatever reason, cannot access a dementia diagnosis in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRACE has been supporting the development of Fastball for several years, and we are excited to see what Dr Stothart’s team will achieve over the next few years with ongoing support from the charity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebebcabbdbd8eacafbaa6e0afade0bba5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Lynn Li&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bath.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Bath&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lynn Li – University of Bath&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A passive and objective measure of recognition memory in mild cognitive impairment using Fastball memory assessment&lt;/a&gt;” by George Stothart et al. &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A passive and objective measure of recognition memory in mild cognitive impairment using Fastball memory assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As viable pharmacotherapies and blood biomarkers emerge for dementia treatment and screening, there remains a great need for accurate, sensitive biomarkers of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have previously demonstrated that Fastball, a new Electroencephalography (EEG) method for the passive and objective measurement of recognition memory that requires no behavioural memory response or task comprehension, is sensitive to cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we present new evidence that Fastball is sensitive to amnestic dysfunction in an earlier stage of the dementia lifecourse, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). 53 MCI patients and 54 healthy older adult (HOA) controls completed a 3-min Fastball task in which they passively viewed rapidly presented images while EEG captured their automatic ability to differentiate between images based on previous exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also completed neuropsychological assessments of memory (Delayed Match to Sample-48), sustained attention (Psychomotor Vigilance Task), and general cognitive function (Addenbrookes Cognitive Exam-iii). Participants were re-tested after 1 year to establish the test-retest reliability of Fastball in HOAs, and the sensitivity of Fastball to cognitive decline in MCI patients, over a 1 year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amnestic MCI patients showed significantly reduced Fastball responses compared with non-amnestic MCI patients (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 0.98) and HOA controls (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005, Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 0.64). Regression analyses showed that Fastball EEG responses were selectively predictive of neuropsychological measures of recognition memory and not attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between baseline and year one follow-up Fastball showed moderate to good test-retest reliability in HOA controls, and the six MCI-dementia converters showed a trend for lower Fastball responses at baseline which will be confirmed with further longitudinal assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fastball is further validated as a viable method for testing recognition memory in cognitively impaired populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated that it is selectively predictive of memory dysfunction and not attention or other cognitive functions. It is passive, non-invasive, quick to administer and uses cheap, scalable EEG technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fastball is a viable functional biomarker that can help to advance cognitive assessment in MCI.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:49:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9GZlAxTVpKbDdRbFd1alFoaFJNRmtOZ2hzYklMck5YSm0wNWRyN0duZm0yU051eVk1ekhvY3N3LU1KN1BBbUk2NzdBT3BYVkVhSmNQS2pBU2JqTUJnaUc0bFh3czdUNmRMcGVxVElhVnhZVEZvc05PZ2xzcw</guid></item><item><title>彭萨科拉的新高血压诊所强调改变生活方式以改善心脏健康- WEAR-TV</title><link>https://weartv.com/news/local/new-hypertension-clinic-in-pensacola-emphasizes-lifestyle-changes-for-better-heart-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PENSACOLA, Fla. -- High blood pressure can be deadly. Studies estimate half of all adults in the United States suffer from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors Madison Gilbert and Josie Blasius are ambulatory care pharmacists. They run the new hypertension clinic at Ascension Sacred Heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, they treat patients with high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time since 2017, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology are telling doctors to switch things up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated guidelines emphasize earlier treatment and lifestyle modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weight management, having a healthy BMI, another big focus is sodium reduction," Dr. Gilbert said. "And then another thing we look at is also anywhere we can limit other outside factors -- smoking, caffeine, other medications that may also increase your blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also emphasize natural approaches to lowering blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Focusing on those fruits and veggies, lean proteins, a healthy diet and then getting an exercise as well," Dr. Blasius said. "And so down the line this will help decrease their overall pill burden and and help with maybe a more natural blood pressure lowering for them in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association's blood pressure chart is the same as it was in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they now advise doctors to use a new screening tool with patients. It's called "prevent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Takes into account blood pressure, smoking history, age, and cholesterol," Dr. Gilbert said. "And also really cool, it adds on your zip code. So it's a potential to look at social determinants of health. So you can specifically look at our zip code here for Escambia, and that'll also look and modify your risk factors and what we should do for treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These new guidelines also include research linking high blood pressure to cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall message:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone get checked, every doctor's appointment you're at," Dr. Gilbert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pharmacists also say it's important to track your blood pressure at home and take that log to your doctors' appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WEAR-TV</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:21:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxONWZuOVlQRjJhNGVZZlh0V1llSVI0cnZFY3hmSzJSR0FVRGVfWlFuVU1hbGdxOHlzS2xuX3otaTgyYlU2Uk0yNm1lZFBHOG1TVmR2Y0hrMW1mRDQtTm45WDJoS1JWYVU2am1Ec3VWUWg0ZVM1MllucGlwNWd4SzNYVDVhempZZHdPVXdUb214bmt0RjFtSVl3ZnlRbnVMZDkyX0loNS1DNTJpcVBWVG0zOHVXRHNOcDFITGV3</guid></item><item><title>慢性压力将免疫细胞送到大脑，导致抑郁症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/depression-neutrophils-stress-29654/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that chronic stress causes immune cells called neutrophils to leave bone marrow in the skull and collect in the brain’s protective membranes, where they contribute to depressive symptoms. In mice, blocking an immune “alarm” pathway reduced these cells and improved mood-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how stress reshapes the brain’s immune environment and suggest why one-third of patients may not benefit from current antidepressants. This immune link could provide biomarkers for tailored treatments and help explain depression’s overlap with neurological conditions like stroke and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic stress triggers neutrophils from skull bone marrow to enter the brain’s meninges, influencing mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathway Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking type I interferon signaling reduced brain neutrophils and depressive behaviors in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could guide new immune-targeted therapies for depression resistant to standard drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune cells released from bone marrow in the skull in response to chronic stress and adversity could play a key role in symptoms of depression and anxiety, say researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery – found in a study in mice – sheds light on the role that inflammation can play in mood disorders and could help in the search for new treatments, in particular for those individuals for whom current treatments are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 1 billion people will be diagnosed with a mood disorder such as depression or anxiety at some point in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there may be many underlying causes, chronic inflammation – when the body’s immune system stays active for a long time, even when there is no infection or injury to fight – has been linked to depression. This suggests that the immune system may play an important role in the development of mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have highlighted how high levels of an immune cell known as a neutrophil, a type of white blood cell, are linked to the severity of depression. But how neutrophils contribute to symptoms of depression is currently unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In research published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge, UK, and the National Institute of Mental Health, USA, tested a hypothesis that chronic stress can lead to the release of neutrophils from bone marrow in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells then collect in the meninges – membranes that cover and protect your brain and spinal cord – and contribute to symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it is not possible to test this hypothesis in humans, the team used mice exposed to chronic social stress. In this experiment, an ‘intruder’ mouse is introduced into the home cage of an aggressive resident mouse. The two have brief daily physical interactions and can otherwise see, smell, and hear each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that prolonged exposure to this stressful environment led to a noticeable increase in levels of neutrophils in the meninges, and that this was linked to signs of depressive behaviour in the mice. Even after the stress ended, the neutrophils lasted longer in the meninges than they did in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis confirmed the researchers’ hypothesis that the meningeal neutrophils – which appeared subtly different from those found in the blood – originated in the skull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that long-term stress triggered a type of immune system ‘alarm warning’ known as type I interferon signalling in the neutrophils. Blocking this pathway – in effect, switching off the alarm – reduced the number of neutrophils in the meninges and improved behaviour in the depressed mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway has previously been linked to depression – type 1 interferons are used to treat patients with hepatitis C, for example, but a known side effect of the medication is that it can cause severe depression during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Stacey Kigar from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge said: “Our work helps explain how chronic stress can lead to lasting changes in the brain’s immune environment, potentially contributing to depression. It also opens the door to possible new treatments that target the immune system rather than just brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a significant proportion of people for whom antidepressants don’t work, possibly as many as one in three patients. If we can figure out what’s happening with the immune system, we may be able to alleviate or reduce depressive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why there are high levels of neutrophils in the meninges is unclear. One explanation could be that they are recruited by microglia, a type of immune cell unique to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation is that chronic stress may cause microhaemorrhages, tiny leaks in brain blood vessels, and that neutrophils – the body’s ‘first responders’ – arrive to fix the damage and prevent any further damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neutrophils then become more rigid, possibly getting stuck in brain capillaries and causing further inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Mary-Ellen Lynall from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge said: “We’ve long known that something is different about how neutrophils behave after stressful events, or during depression, but we didn’t know what these neutrophils were doing, where they were going, or how they might be affecting the brain and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that these ‘first responder’ immune cells leave the skull bone marrow and travel to the brain, where they can influence mood and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people will have experienced how our immune systems can drive short-lived depression-like symptoms. When we are sick, for example with a cold or flu, we often lack energy and appetite, sleep more and withdraw from social contact. If the immune system is always in a heightened, pro-inflammatory state, it shouldn’t be too surprising if we experience longer-term problems with our mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide a useful signature, or ‘biomarker’, to help identify those patients whose mood disorders are related to inflammation. This could help in the search for better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a clinical trial of a potential new drug that targets inflammation of the brain in depression might appear to fail if trialled on a general cohort of people with depression, whereas using the biomarker to identify individuals whose depression is linked to inflammation could increase the likelihood of the trial succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may also help explain why depression is a symptom common in other neurological disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease, as it may be the case that neutrophils are being released in response to the damage to the brain seen in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may also explain why depression is itself a risk factor for dementia in later life, if neutrophils can themselves trigger damage to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, Medical Research Council and National Institute for Health and Care Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7b4a5b6beb0f9b5a5beb2a5bbb2ae97b6b3babeb9f9b4b6baf9b6b4f9a2bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Brierley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Brierley – University of Cambridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62840-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic social defeat stress induces meningeal neutrophilia via type I interferon signaling in male mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Stacey Kigar et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic social defeat stress induces meningeal neutrophilia via type I interferon signaling in male mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders.

Transcriptional analysis suggests CSD increases type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in meningeal neutrophils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking this pathway via the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR) protects against the negative behavioral effects of CSD stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our identification of IFN-I signaling as a putative mediator of meningeal neutrophil recruitment may facilitlate development of new therapies for stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:15:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1DWnFUckhEbkFLWGNIOEYzZF9hUmdDNFJfdjVhd1ZYNTVlcXJCaDNUaTVqMWdKalUzbEVtYkZPelhSWnVHVkdyV3EyN0dZdkRNcks1aEVMcXAxRGNrLThHQXdodVVIckNlQnNfNV8wbnRBOWs</guid></item><item><title>植物性营养素可以提高免疫细胞对抗癌症的能力- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-based-nutrient-boost-immune-cells.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from the University of Chicago discovered that zeaxanthin, a plant-derived carotenoid best known for protecting vision, may also act as an immune-boosting compound by strengthening the cancer-fighting activity of immune cells. The findings, which are published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00397-0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlight the potential of zeaxanthin as a widely available supplement to improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that zeaxanthin, already known for its role in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/eye+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;eye health&lt;/a&gt;, has a completely new function in boosting anti-tumor immunity," said Jing Chen, Ph.D., Janet Davison Rowley Distinguished Service Professor of Medicine and senior author of the study. "Our study shows that a simple dietary nutrient could complement and strengthen advanced &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments like immunotherapy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does this nutrient work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study builds on years of work by Chen's lab to better understand how nutrients influence the immune system. By screening a large blood nutrient library, the team identified zeaxanthin as a compound that directly enhances the activity of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, a crucial type of immune cell that kills &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor cells&lt;/a&gt;. These cells rely on a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+structure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular structure&lt;/a&gt; called the T-cell receptor (TCR) to recognize and destroy abnormal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that zeaxanthin stabilizes and strengthens the formation of TCR complex on CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells upon interacting with the cancer cells. This, in turn, triggers more robust intracellular signaling that boosts T-cell activation, cytokine production, and tumor-killing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Zeaxanthin improves immunotherapy effects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, dietary supplementation with zeaxanthin slowed tumor growth. Importantly, when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors—a type of immunotherapy that has transformed cancer treatment in recent years—zeaxanthin significantly enhanced anti-tumor effects compared to immunotherapy alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the findings, the researchers tested human T cells engineered to recognize specific tumor antigens and found that zeaxanthin treatment improved these cells' ability to kill melanoma, multiple myeloma, and glioblastoma cells in laboratory experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data show that zeaxanthin improves both natural and engineered T-cell responses, which suggests high translational potential for patients undergoing immunotherapies," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A safe and accessible candidate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeaxanthin is sold as an over-the-counter supplement for eye health, and is naturally found in vegetables like orange peppers, spinach, and kale. It's inexpensive, widely available, well-tolerated and, most importantly, its safety profile is known—which means it can be safely tested as an adjunct to cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also reinforces the importance of a balanced diet. In their previous research, Chen's group discovered that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-11-nutrient-beef-dairy-immune-response.html"&gt;trans-vaccenic acid (TVA), a fatty acid derived from dairy and meat&lt;/a&gt;, also boosts T-cell activity—but through a different mechanism. Together, the findings suggest that nutrients from both plant and animal sources may provide complementary benefits to immune health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clinical applications of zeaxanthin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the results are promising, the researchers emphasize that the work is still at an early stage. Most of the findings come from laboratory experiments and animal studies. Thus, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to determine whether &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/zeaxanthin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;zeaxanthin&lt;/a&gt; supplements can improve outcomes for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open a new field of nutritional immunology that looks at how specific dietary components interact with the immune system at the molecular level," Chen said. "With more research, we may discover natural compounds that make today's cancer therapies more effective and accessible."&lt;/p&gt;

They found an inverted U-shaped lifespan trajectory, with brain activity rising through adolescence, peaking between ages 27 and 36, and then gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern reflects peak cognitive efficiency in adulthood and highlights the importance of maintaining brain health later in life. The findings deepen our understanding of brain development and aging, offering a scientific foundation for age-tailored cognitive training and brain health strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inverted U-Shape:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognitive control brain activity peaks in early adulthood, then declines with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peak Interval:&lt;/strong&gt; Ages 27–36 represent the highest efficiency in focus and cognitive flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Results underscore the need for targeted cognitive support in midlife to slow decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Science China Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive control refers to the cognitive process through which individuals regulate attention, thought, and action to achieve specific goals, allowing them to focus on objectives while excluding distractions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, maintaining concentration on reading in a library where people are conversing relies heavily on the cognitive control’s regulation of attention. In adults, cognitive control abilities typically remain at a high level, resulting in organized behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, children and older adults may experience behavioral regulation difficulties due to the immature or declining state of their cognitive control systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the patterns of cognitive and behavioral changes related to cognitive control have been well established and serve as diagnostic criteria for development- and aging-related diseases, systematic research on the corresponding brain activities’ changes with age remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revealing the lifespan trajectories of brain activity associated with cognitive control could deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying brain development and aging and provide theoretical support for customized cognitive training programs based on regional brain activity characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study collected 139 neuroimaging studies related to cognitive conflict tasks (e.g., judging the direction of the center arrow in ←←→←← while ignoring the arrows on both sides), encompassing 3,765 participants aged 5 to 85 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through systematic meta-analysis using seed-based effect size mapping (SDM), generalized additive models (GAM), and model comparison methods, researchers were able to construct the lifespan trajectory of brain activities associated with cognitive control for the first time (see Image).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core finding revealed a significant inverted U-shaped lifespan developmental trajectory, where brain activity gradually increases during childhood and adolescence, peaks during adulthood, and slowly declines in later life. The GAM-fitted peak age was found to be between 27 and 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Model comparisons indicated that the optimal fitting model for these brain regions was the square root model, rather than the commonly used quadratic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the researchers did not observe other potential trajectory patterns, such as linear changes or an increase-then-stable, underscoring the dominance of the inverted U-shape in the development of cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it was found that adolescents and older adults exhibited more pronounced lateralization of brain function compared to young and middle-aged adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have revealed an inverted U-shaped developmental trajectory of cognitive control ability at the behavioral level. This study further elucidates the neural basis of this trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicate that the peak intervals of brain functions related to cognitive control occur between 27 and 36 years, aligning closely with the commonly defined middle adulthood stage (young adult phase).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This period coincides with the peak of individual intellectual maturity and overall cognitive ability, providing a scientific explanation for the high social productivity and creativity exhibited by humans during this phase from a neural mechanism perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the gradual decline in brain function following this peak period suggests the need to prioritize the maintenance and exercise of brain function during middle adulthood to mitigate potential cognitive decline associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Therefore, this study not only deepens our understanding of the lifespan developmental patterns of the neural mechanisms underlying human cognitive control but also provides critical theoretical support for formulating targeted brain health promotion strategies and optimizing cognitive functions across different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhenghan Li from Hangzhou Normal University is the first author of the article, while Dr. Guochun Yang from the Guangdong Intelligent Science and Technology Research Institute serves as the corresponding author.

Understanding its trajectory across the lifespan is crucial for optimizing cognitive function throughout life, particularly during periods of rapid development and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While existing studies have revealed an inverted U-shaped trajectory of cognitive control in both behavioral and anatomical domains, the age-related changes in functional brain activities remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of 139 neuroimaging studies using conflict tasks, encompassing 3765 participants aged 5 to 85 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We adopted the seed-based d mapping (SDM), generalized additive model (GAM), and model comparison approaches to investigate age-related changes in brain activities to characterize the lifespan trajectories of cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analyses revealed two key findings: (1) The predominant lifespan trajectory is inverted U-shaped, rising from childhood to peak in young adulthood (between 27 and 36 years) before declining in later adulthood; (2) Both the youth and the elderly show weaker brain activities and greater left laterality than young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results collectively reveal the lifespan trajectories of cognitive control, highlighting systematic fluctuations in brain activities with age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 20:03:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1EbWNud3ExQXQzcGNfWkdzOTEzV2dXb3BtaFJRdjUya0VXeGs4WUhmWDlxWDlRMDFpM3RQWGJwWE8zd2VhVFc4Zi1kV013QkZXV1BSM3dDc0lrQTBMN1pXZksxUHJva0Y4bXpuVGdLLVNxWkY2dXd5a3RNRzk</guid></item><item><title>“fibermaxxing”的危险......专家揭示了饮食趋势如何增加患癌症的风险-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15058047/dangers-fibermaxxing-experts-warn-risk-cancer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's no secret that America has a fiber problem.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggests about 95 percent of Americans don't get the federally recommended amount of fiber in a day from foods like berries, apples, broccoli and lentils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber is crucial for regulating healthy digestion. It helps bulk up stools to make them easier to pass, promoting regular bowel movements. It also slows gastric emptying, which leads to longer feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the shorter term, not getting at least 21 to 38 grams of daily fiber, depending on age and sex, can lead to constipation, bloating, cramping and gas. But over time, low fiber has been linked to chronic inflammation, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-51e2f670-8808-11f0-9c1a-d73045d9f333"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-51e28140-8808-11f0-9c1a-d73045d9f333"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, health experts are now sounding the alarm over getting too much fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social media users are promoting 'fibermaxxing,' or loading up on large amounts of fiber, particularly from the plethora of emerging sodas and snacks high in the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietitians and physicians told DailyMail.com that while fiber is essential for maintaining healthy digestion, too much can lead to 'gastrointestinal distress,' including constipation, bloating, gas and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the long term, getting upwards of 50 grams per day may lead to a rare chance of intestinal blockages. Emerging research also shows certain kinds of fiber like inulin, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14554801/healthy-soda-alternatives-celebrities-cancer-poppi-olipop.html"&gt;found in high-fiber drinks like Poppi&lt;/a&gt;, may increase the risk of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 95 percent of Americans don't get enough fiber-rich foods like broccoli and whole grains. But experts have warned of the dangers of eating too much (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paris Hilton is among Poppi's high profile fans. The soda is high in inulin, a type of fiber that some studies have linked to cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Candace Pumper, a registered dietitian at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told DailyMail.com: 'Consuming adequate fiber within established guidelines in our diet is important for optimal health and bodily function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dietary fiber provides many functional benefits – such as adding bulk to stool, which is important for promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation – and physiological benefits through fermentation by the gut microbiome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These effects have been shown to lower cholesterol, regulate blood sugar, promote satiety and reduce inflammation, Pumper said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regulating these functions, she noted, is associated 'with a decreased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and colorectal cancers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Most Americans are not meeting the recommended daily amount of dietary fiber, making its optimization an important health strategy for reducing their risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help fill these gaps, snacks and sodas high in fiber have gained popularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poppi and Olipop, for instance, contain between three to nine grams of inulin, a form of dietary fiber found naturally in some plants chicory root, garlic, onions, and Jerusalem artichoke. It is also considered a fructan, a type of prebiotic, meaning it can help feed 'good' bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gut bacteria convert inulin and other prebiotics into short-chain fatty acids, which can help strengthen the gut's protective lining and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a growing body of research suggests repeated inulin consumption could lead to long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrew Gewirtz, a biomedical science professor at Georgia State University, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.gsu.edu/2018/10/18/adding-refined-fiber-to-processed-food-could-have-negative-health-effects-study-finds/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;conducted a 2018 study&lt;/a&gt; that found mice who had inulin added to their diets developed jaundice, a sign of liver failure. After six months, they showed signs of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S277257232300198X"&gt;2024 case study&lt;/a&gt; authored by the same team suggested inulin 'may be carcinogenic.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Olipop is one of the most popular fiber-rich soda brands, generating $500million in sales last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man in the case study had his first colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer at age 56, which came back normal. But seven years later, another screening showed a malignant tumor at the start of his large intestine. The disease had also spread to his lymph nodes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now in his 60s, the man had no known colon cancer risk factors like obesity, alcohol use, or family history, and his diet was rich in organic, home-grown vegetables. His only lifestyle change in the time between screenings was adding four grams of inulin powder daily to his diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gena Hamshaw, a registered dietitian at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, told DailyMail.com: 'While inulin in sodas may favor a healthy balance of intestinal flora, it doesn’t offer all of the benefits of other types of fiber, such as the inhibition of cholesterol absorption that’s associated with soluble fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s important to remember that there are different types of fiber, each with benefits, and the best means of reaping all of their benefits is to eat a varied diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking several of these sodas could quickly increase overall fiber consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14554801/healthy-soda-alternatives-celebrities-cancer-poppi-olipop.html"&gt;previously reached out&lt;/a&gt; to Poppi and Olipop regarding these claims but did not hear back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Olipop &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/29/poppi-olipop-healthy-soda-warning"&gt;told Axios&lt;/a&gt; in a March statement: 'Like any fiber, inulin may cause temporary digestive discomfort as the body adjusts to increased fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why both nutrition experts and OLIPOP recommend starting with one can and gradually increasing over time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brea Lofton, a registered dietitian nutritionist at health and wellness company Lumen, told this website that while it 'is undoubted that fiber can be beneficial for a number of reasons,' consuming excessive amounts, 'especially when you increase your fiber intake too quickly, can lead to gastrointestinal distress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts told DailyMail.com to get a variety of fiber sources instead of relying on one or two from processed foods (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pumper said: 'Sudden increases in fiber or consuming too much fiber, whether above the recommended daily amount or all at once, may cause bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Overdoing it can also cause constipation and impair nutrient absorption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because the gut microbiome needs time to adjust to increased fiber if someone generally consumes under the recommended amount.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hamshaw told this website that while rare, 'an intestinal blockage could be the result of extremely high fiber intake, especially without good hydration and enough chewing of food.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In large quantities and without enough water to help with absorption, undigested fiber can form a dense mass called a bezoar. This risk is highest in people with digestive conditions like Crohn's disease or previous bowel surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another long-term concern is that excessive fiber intake may inhibit absorption of important minerals, including iron, zinc, and calcium,' Hamshaw said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said while there is no firm limit, getting upwards of 50 grams of fiber per day is enough to cause complications. Dr Omer Awan, a medical professor at the University of Maryland with a specialization in epidemiology, meanwhile told DailyMail.com the limit might be closer to 70 grams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hamshaw told this website: 'It's also good to keep in mind that the plant foods with the most dietary fiber, including fruits, vegetables, seeds, grains, and nuts, are typically nutrient-dense foods.

They'd rather not think about the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But for Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) Director Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, the mistakes that were made during the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the lessons learned, provide an opportunity to explore how a future pandemic caused by an even deadlier virus than SARS-CoV-2 could play out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Osterholm and his co-author and longtime collaborator Mark Olshaker weave together two threads. One is an assessment of how the COVID-19 pandemic was handled by the US government and public health agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Osterholm says it's the culmination of a project that began early on in the pandemic, when he and Olshaker recognized that many mistakes were being made and they authored several op-eds that were critical of the federal response.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"At that point, we realized we really needed to write a book about this pandemic when it finally ends, and what lessons should be learned," he says in an upcoming episode of the Osterholm Update podcast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Along the way, Osterholm and Olshaker address many of the most prominent controversies that have come to dominate the national discussion about the pandemic, from lockdowns and school closures to communications failures and the debates over masking and vaccine mandates. The aim was not just to highlight the mistakes or place blame, but to understand the lessons that can be drawn from those mistakes and then applied to the next pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Some of the problems we collectively encountered were structural, and not quick or easy to solve," Osterholm and Olshaker write. "But they all have to be addressed if we are to have a chance of triumphing in the microbe wars."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;'A great mystery story'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next pandemic is the focus of the other strand of the book, a "thought experiment" developed by Osterholm and Olshaker that traces the path of a hypothetical virus that originates in Somalia, soon jumps to a nearby refugee camp in Kenya, and then spreads like wildfire around the globe. The virus, eventually labeled SARS-CoV-3, combines the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 with the lethality of the original SARS virus (which caused a global outbreak in 2003) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What would happen if you had a virus that had the capacity to infect like COVID, but the ability to kill like MERS or SARS?" asks Osterholm, who is also a Regents Professor and the McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair in Public Health at the University of Minnesota. "And believe it or not, we have now found viruses—in bats in caves in China—that have that construct. So this is not just science fiction; we actually know these viruses exist."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scenario describes the impact of the virus as it spreads and causes havoc around the globe, but it also delves into the response from US and global officials, the public reaction, and the role of the media. For many readers, it might feel like being transported back to early 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What would happen if you had a virus that had the capacity to infect like COVID, but the ability to kill like MERS or SARS?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Olshaker says they wanted to create a "nightmare scenario" that was realistic, scientifically plausible, not over-the-top, and gripping. He compares it to the true crime books he's co-authored.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What we have here is great mystery story, which is what public health really is, as well as high technological drama," he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph/the-big-one/9780316258340/?lens=little-brown-spark"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is out today.

              &lt;p&gt;A common treatment given after heart attacks may not be worthwhile for a large segment of the population. New trial data finds that most people who suffer a heart attack do not benefit from taking beta-blockers afterward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large international team of researchers conducted the trial, which compared the outcomes of nearly 10,000 heart attack patients who were either given beta-blocker therapy or not.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;On average, people with preserved heart function given beta-blockers were no less likely to die or to experience a second heart attack than those not given beta-blockers, the researchers found. Secondary data also showed that women might actually face a higher risk of complications from taking these medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines,” said senior study author Valentin Fuster, president of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250831010539.htm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why doctors use beta-blockers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more than 40 years, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/beta-blockers/art-20044522"&gt;beta-blockers&lt;/a&gt; have been a key aspect of treating and managing cardiovascular disease. These drugs block the effects of adrenaline on the body’s beta-receptors, which then reduces heart rate and lowers blood pressure (among other bodily changes). They’re often used to reduce stress on a badly damaged heart following a heart attack (myocardial infarction), in theory lowering the risk of a second heart attack or other cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But heart medicine has evolved greatly since the arrival of the first beta-blockers in the 1960s. New treatments and improved knowledge have made it easier for doctors to prevent these infarctions from causing as much damage to the heart as before. And that’s led some researchers to wonder whether beta-blockers should still be considered a front-line treatment following heart attacks, including the team behind this large new trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A therapy in need of a reboot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s trial, named REBOOT, involved roughly 8,500 people. The patients had all experienced relatively mild heart attacks and appeared to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) above 40%. LVEF measures how well our left ventricle (the main pumping chamber) pumps out blood. A healthy LVEF is typically considered above 51%, while slightly reduced function is between 40% and 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Half of the patients were randomized to receive beta-blockers after being discharged from the hospital, while the other half received none. Both groups were then tracked for several years (median length 3.7 years).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, there wasn’t any significant difference in outcomes between the two groups. Deaths (from any cause), secondary heart attacks, and hospitalizations from heart failure occurred just as often in the beta-blocker group as they did in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since these kinds of heart attacks represent the majority of cases (roughly 80%) today, the team’s findings—&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504735"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine—indicate that beta-blockers shouldn’t be a standard treatment for most heart attack patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Harmful for some, useful for others&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While beta-blocker therapy may be worthless for most male heart attack patients, it could be actively dangerous to women in particular.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a secondary analysis of the REBOOT results, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf673/8243876"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the European Heart Journal, women on beta-blockers had higher rates of heart attacks, hospitalization, and death than women not on the drug. On closer inspection, this added risk was only seen in women who maintained normal heart function (LVEF above 50%). Though it’s not entirely clear why only women might experience this risk, studies have found that heart attacks can &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2024/02/09/the-slowly-evolving-truth-about-heart-disease-and-women#:~:text=As%20for%20better,in%20their%20arteries."&gt;present differently&lt;/a&gt; in women compared to men and cause differing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings should better optimize the long-term care of heart attack patients, who are often already prescribed multiple medications to keep their cardiovascular health in check. “These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year,” said lead author Borja Ibáñez, scientific director of Spain’s National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC), in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, the REBOOT trial won’t bury beta-blockers for good. The drugs may still help prevent complications in people with severe heart attacks and are &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/22318-beta-blockers"&gt;widely used&lt;/a&gt; for other conditions, including congestive heart failure, migraines, and even performance anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
              
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vr8sw000o3b7abepiwsjm@published"&gt;I’m a straight, cis female. My whole adult life, vaginal sex has always been sort of meh to me. I love the foreplay, my clitoris is very sensitive, and I get easily turned on. But when it comes to the actual intercourse part, it’s always felt like nothing at best and vaguely painful at worst. I’ve seen doctors, but the symptoms of conditions like vaginismus and vulvodynia don’t really match mine. It kind of just feels like I have no nerve endings in there at all. I’ve also gone to bed with enough men to know it’s not just a bad partner. Toys do nothing for me either.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="13" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vr8w8000p3b7atmv99318@published"&gt;A few months ago, my boyfriend and I decided to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2wpz4j005y3b7apvy06pmb@published"&gt;We had anal sex. I’d always been resistant to anal because I have some digestive issues, but wanted to try it, so we did, and WOW. It’s like whatever nerves are missing from my vagina got put in the back door instead. I finally understood what people love about penetrative sex, and it didn’t hurt at all. I’ve never had an orgasm just from penetration before until that night, when I had like three or four in a row without touching my clit at all. It’s not just the orgasm part; it’s just the feeling of anything at all pleasurable from penetration. It got even better the deeper my partner went (whereas in regular PIV, I tend to have less sensation the deeper it is).&lt;/p&gt;

The digestive issues have not improved (and actually have worsened). And I don’t think my boyfriend wants to do anal every single time we have sex (is that even healthy?). Why does anal sex feel so good for me compared to vaginal sex? Everything I’ve seen online says even the cis females who enjoy anal and find that it feels good still prefer vaginal sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmf2y1b6v006n3b7awp4rky2i@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="319"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, for some people, anal sex can definitely be a pleasurable alternative. The anus and rectum have different nerve endings and innervation patterns compared to the vagina, which can translate into entirely different sensations. The so-called “A-spot” (anterior fornix) and surrounding nerve-rich tissue can create intense stimulation and, for many, powerful orgasms. Pleasure here often comes down to anatomy, muscle relaxation, and pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anal canal is surrounded by muscles that need to be relaxed, and its skin is thinner and more delicate, which means lubrication, patience, and gradual progression are absolutely necessary. This is where tools like anal dilators (such as &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/glass-anal-dilator-set"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/silicone-anal-dilator-set"&gt;silicone&lt;/a&gt; sets, like the ones I developed for Future Method) can help train both body and mind. Starting small, pre-lubricating, and working up in size conditions the muscles and tissue to stretch comfortably. Many people also find that experimenting with different positions, depth, and thrusting styles during toy play helps them discover what feels good while maintaining control over the experience. I’m a huge advocate of personal exploration because it allows people to see what they like (and don’t like) without the pressure of having to perform for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common worry is the digestive system “getting in the way.” The reality is that with everyday anal play, the rectum is usually clear of stool. Good digestive health makes a huge difference, such as adequate dietary fiber, probiotics, and hydration to support regularity and reduce the likelihood of issues. If someone chooses to prepare ahead of time, I recommend douching safely; over-cleansing with plain water, harsh soaps, or even store-bought enemas can damage tissue and disrupt the microbiome. That’s why I developed an &lt;a href="https://futuremethod.com/products/anal-douche-kit"&gt;isotonic cleansing solution&lt;/a&gt; at Future Method, designed to be body-compatible, non-irritating, and effective without stripping natural defenses. I know people crave confidence when it comes to anal play, so why not have a body-safe solution to help you achieve that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here’s what Dr. Goldstein recommends: “For vaginal pain: a gynecologist trained in sexual pain disorders, for anal health concerns: a proctological surgeon, and for pelvic floor dysfunction or muscle-related pain: a pelvic floor physical therapist,” adding that “each of these specialists brings a different perspective, and ideally, they work together to ensure a holistic plan.”&lt;/p&gt;

His preferences will likely be a balance between how he feels about the act itself and how he feels about your pleasure, and he’s the only person who can say, with certainty, what his stance is.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re happy to be glorified for something your body does by happenstance, go forth and enjoy, because you will find plenty of salivating supplicants. If you’re willing to give a personal Q&amp;amp;A session to satiate someone’s curiosity, again, great. If you’re not OK with either of those scenarios, always know that you get to have boundaries, and you get to decide how you’re willing to be treated in hook-ups and relationships. And you get to make those choices from date to date, depending on the context of the person you’re interacting with and how you’re feeling that day.&lt;/p&gt;

The place we’ve rented has a private hot tub, so my husband and I finally got to realize our fantasy of skinny dipping together. While we were in the hot tub, I rediscovered an old favorite of mine. When I was a kid, I used to swim competitively, so I spent a lot of time in the pool. When I was very young, I accidentally discovered that the pool jet against my clit felt amazing. When I got a little older, I connected the dots and realized I’d essentially been masturbating in public, so I stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmf2vw7v900293b7aofzmnqrk@published"&gt;Flash forward to now: I’ve told my husband my childhood pool jet story, so he asked if I’d mind using the pool jet while he watched. I did, and it was so incredibly hot, and my orgasm was crazy intense. Now, we’re wondering if there’s any toy that might simulate the sensation of a pool jet on my clit. We’ve played around with some different vibrators before, but none of them have been quite right. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re in an area where you’re not worried about water consumption, a fairly focused showerhead will be your most similar option, and you can probably get pretty close to the same sensation from the jet if you use that showerhead underwater in a full bath. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

When I first noticed our “slump,” he told me he was too busy and tired from work to have sex. After the first sexless year rolled by, he said he needed to lose weight to feel confident enough for sex. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/02/husband-does-not-want-sex-advice.html"&gt;Since, we moved to a new city last year, and he has indeed lost weight and gotten a job that requires much less take-home work…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
