   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Painful sex. Urinary leakage. Constipation. Weak orgasms. What do these unpleasant experiences have in common?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They can all be symptoms of a pelvic floor dysfunction in women, says &lt;a href="https://thevagwhisperer.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;Sara Reardon&lt;/a&gt;, a pelvic floor physical therapist who has been in the field for nearly two decades. She is the author of &lt;a href="https://thevagwhisperer.com/floored/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Floored: A Woman's Guide to Pelvic Floor Health at Every Age and Stage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published in June.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22729-pelvic-floor-muscles" target="_blank"&gt;pelvic floor&lt;/a&gt; is a basket of muscles that sits at the bottom of your pelvis and has an important role, Reardon says&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It supports organs like your bladder, bowels and reproductive system. It also works with your abdominal muscles to support your spine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But for as much as we use our pelvic floor, "many of us don't know these muscles exist," she says. "Therefore, if a problem arises, [we don't know] how to evaluate it and get treatment for it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One in three women will experience a pelvic floor disorder in her lifetime, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/17474108.4.2.165" target="_blank"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;including young women and postmenopausal women who have never given birth, Reardon says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pelvic floor physical therapy, such as certain exercises and stretches, can be an effective way to address some of these issues, she says. Studies have shown it can &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e7d4fB8KNrh-5VaoeHBcpeOLdc6OoSXy/view" target="_blank"&gt;improve bowel and bladder control, make sex more enjoyable, decrease lower back pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fRuCAtw8_G2srV5SaTVkyuxxZVvqxcur/view" target="_blank"&gt;improve postpartum recovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reardon talked to Life Kit about what people with vaginas should know about their pelvic floor and what to do if you have pelvic floor pain. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some facts from the book that I think people might find surprising: Orgasms are pelvic floor &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258326/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;muscle contractions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yes, those muscles are the ones that contract and relax during an orgasm, and so if you have a pelvic floor muscle issue, it could cause the &lt;a href="https://share.upmc.com/2022/01/sexual-dysfunction/" target="_blank"&gt;inability to orgasm&lt;/a&gt;, pain with orgasms and weak orgasms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing out your pee is not great for you.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yeah. Just say no to &lt;a href="https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/why-you-shouldnt-push-when-you-pee/" target="_blank"&gt;power peeing&lt;/a&gt;. You want to sit, relax and let it flow. Relaxing your pelvic floor allows your bladder, which is a muscle, to push the urine out, and that's really how you're supposed to pee. Sit instead of hovering, breathe and chill, and then your bladder muscle contracts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tense pelvic floor muscles can cause constipation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Correct.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let's talk about some of the symptoms that can indicate pelvic floor dysfunction. What are common signs you might have pelvic floor tension or tightness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your muscles have to relax fully to empty your bowels. If they're not relaxing because they're overly tight or tense, you can have straining with bowel movements, hemorrhoids, fissures, incomplete emptying and even feeling like your stools are really thin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tightness can also lead to having a hard time starting your urine stream. You may feel like your bladder isn't emptying completely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another common symptom is painful intercourse. It can feel like something can't enter the vagina. You may also feel that with inserting tampons or during pelvic examinations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do to prevent or address pelvic floor tension?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Watch your posture. A lot of us sit too much throughout the day. Vary your movements. If you are sitting, keep your feet flat or cross at the ankles. Also, unclench your butt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Take some big, deep breaths throughout the day to soften your pelvic floor muscles; then work on stretching with a deep squat or yoga poses like child's pose or happy baby pose.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also devices you can use at home for internal massage to the muscles, such as a &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/postpartum-health-and-care/pelvic-wand#definition" target="_blank"&gt;therapy wand&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/patient-education/how-use-vaginal-dilator" target="_blank"&gt;vaginal dilators&lt;/a&gt; to help relax the muscles internally.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other sign of pelvic floor dysfunction is weakness. What does that look like in the body?  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the things we commonly see are urinary leakage when coughing, sneezing, running and jumping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Another is pelvic organ prolapse, where the pelvic organs aren't as supported by that hammock of muscles as we'd like them to be, so they start to drop or push into the vaginal canal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you feel less sensation with intercourse or urinate during intercourse or orgasms, those can be other signs of weak pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we strengthen our pelvic floor muscles? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Work on pelvic floor strengthening exercises. Do quick Kegel contractions and longer-hold five- or 10-second Kegel contractions in different positions and during exercises like lunges and squats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tighten those muscles before activities that cause leakage. I always say, "Kegel before you cough," or "Squeeze before you sneeze."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The biggest thing is to stop straining [when you go to the bathroom], because that can weaken your pelvic floor over time. For bowel movements, I recommend using a stool under your feet to put you in the squatting position [and make it easier to go].&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are having these symptoms, what should you do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In every state in the United States, you can access a pelvic floor therapist for an evaluation without a referral from a physician.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Your insurance may require [a referral], but you can at least have an evaluation, and they can tell you whether you have a pelvic floor muscle issue and connect you with a medical provider who can see you and/or write a prescription to continue treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you have common signs of infection of the urinary tract or the vagina, your first stop should be checking with a medical provider and getting things [like a urinary tract infection or a yeast infection] ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should you look for in a pelvic floor physical therapist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They should be trained and qualified to do a pelvic floor muscle internal assessment to evaluate the pelvic floor muscles. They should not just hook you up to devices like Kegel or electric stimulation machines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The treatment should be a combination of exercise, manual therapy and education. They should also give you things at home to work on so you can do some self-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You want to look for somebody with training and compassion who is a really good listener. We're talking about vulnerable and intimate issues, and if you don't feel comfortable having these conversations and talking about your symptoms with your therapist, I would find a new therapist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was edited by Malaka Gharib.

which are also licensed for type 2 diabetes - are being asked to report the detail on the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Yellow Card website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They will then be asked if they would be willing to take part in the study, which will check whether some people are at a higher genetic risk of acute pancreatitis when taking these medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Patients will be asked to submit more information and a saliva sample, with the overall aim of reducing the occurrence of the side effects in future, says the MHRA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases recorded on the Yellow Card website up until 13 May this year include 10 in which patients, who were using weight loss drugs, died from the effects of pancreatitis - but it is not clear whether other factors also played a part.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is impossible to know exactly how many people in the UK are on weight loss drugs as many users obtain them online through unregulated sources, rather than through their doctors.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health officials have suggested the jabs could help turn the tide on obesity. However, they have also warned the drugs are not a silver bullet and often come with side effects, commonly including nausea, constipation and diarrhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And the MHRA has also warned that &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn0gp2pl7zwo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Mounjaro could make the oral contraceptive pill less effective for some patients.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA's chief safety officer said information from the study "will help us to better predict those most at risk of adverse reactions, enabling patients across the UK to receive the safest medicine for them, based on their genetic make-up". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said evidence showed almost a third of side effects to medicines could be prevented with genetic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It is predicted that adverse drug reactions could cost the NHS more than £2.2bn a year in hospital stays alone," she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Matt Brown, chief scientific officer at Genomics England, said: "GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines there can be a risk of serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimise these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said the next step would be to "generate data and evidence for safer and more effective treatment through more personalised approaches to prescription, supporting a shift towards an increasingly prevention-focused healthcare system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 12:11:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5TRDJSS3NDNXF5eWs5WldJMWdaT2JGeXk5dF82MFhPNC0zc1J6Rlg1Skg4X2xmSUw5ZTVES2JjbF92WVlWYmFxQm93OUJtYU05ajdRMjk0TlpMQdIBX0FVX3lxTFBhd1FFZmFBdnA1cF91R2R4TWlXWlh4ODV6aEVhbl9YLXBnVEJBb2QzaVd3RGJxbS1sNHBPV2JnbDdfaXJqdEFMTWlsYjlxSFE3dDRYRkxidlVsZXZ2ODFJ</guid></item><item><title>新设备可节省面临5-器官故障的儿童-新闻 | New Device Saves Child Facing 5-Organ Failure - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVGQzRzVBOV9DOUFVNUMzNmhoNW54U1BSTDVMMzF2Sm1PM3VIb05tdV9CeXZDYlRSZnNiR3ZmQ2pzdlBhU1RRZ1hPMWhaY05TVU0yMUlZMi1PVkd6bHZySFAxNTk4d05UM19NUzJmSTB6aEgtdU9saTRvZ3RqQ2VUdWZMbV9YWVBtMmg2TjltOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Conventional treatments didn't seem to be the way forward, so the team opted to try the SCD, a device developed at the University of Michigan over two decades. The SCD, which is now FDA-approved for certain uses, works by filtering the patient's blood outside the body. It temporarily modifies white blood cells to reduce the excessive inflammatory response that can damage organs during severe infections like sepsis.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        There was concern about using the device, as the child's white blood cell count was unusually low due to chemotherapy, raising the risk of worsening the infection. However, after emergency approval, the device was used. The intervention improved blood cell counts and restored kidney and liver function, all without significant side effects. The child was eventually taken off mechanical ventilation and, after 38 days in intensive care, transferred to a general hospital ward. The patient has since returned home, is off dialysis, and is reportedly cancer-free.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;center&gt;
                                        &lt;p id="divStoryContinues"&gt;story continues below&lt;/p&gt;
                                        
                                    &lt;/center&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        "The SCD therapy won't just stop the storm but could potentially reverse the damage," notes the &lt;a href="https://seastarmedical.com/our-solution/"&gt;SeaStar website&lt;/a&gt;. The success in this case has led to wider adoption at other pediatric centers. One caveat: The research came from the National Institutes of Health and private philanthropy, with some researchers holding financial interests in companies associated with the technology.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

Wet AMD occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow in the back of the eye, harming the macula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AMD is a leading cause of vision loss among the elderly in developed countries,” &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Siwei-Liu-2304745211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Siwei Liu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology for Shiyan Taihe Hospital at Hubei University of Medicine in China, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As there is currently no cure, identifying new modifiable factors is crucial for slowing disease progression, preserving vision, and improving patients’ quality of life,” Liu added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liu is the lead author of a new study published in the journal &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.70439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food Science &amp;amp; Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, which has found that a combination of genetics and drinking instant coffee may increase a person’s risk of developing dry AMD. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers first obtained coffee consumption data for more than 500,000 participants from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. Scientists broke participants into &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325502" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;decaffeinated&lt;/a&gt;, ground, and instant coffee consumption groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also obtained both dry and wet AMD data for adults 50 and over from the &lt;a href="https://www.finngen.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Finngen GWAS dataset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide and is rich in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; that may offer neuroprotective effects,” Liu explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“At the same time, growing evidence shows that genetics influence dietary preferences. Studying the genetic predisposition to coffee consumption and its relationship with AMD risk may help reveal potential causal links between diet and eye diseases,” the study author noted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the study’s conclusion, researchers identified an overlap between a person’s genetic disposition towards drinking instant coffee and their risk for dry AMD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additionally, within this genetic correlation, scientists found that drinking instant coffee, compared to other types of coffee consumption, increased dry AMD risk by about sevenfold. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This genetic overlap suggests that there may be shared biological pathways or metabolic mechanisms connecting the preference for instant coffee with the risk of developing dry AMD,” Liu said. “It provides new insight into AMD pathogenesis and offers a potential direction for personalized prevention strategies, such as gene-informed lifestyle interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers stated they did not find any association between coffee consumption and wet AMD risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next steps in this research, Liu said she and her team plan to validate the association in independent populations and conduct functional studies to explore whether the metabolic pathways linked to instant coffee consumption are directly involved in AMD pathophysiology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also aim to perform longitudinal cohort analyses to clarify the causal relationship between coffee intake and AMD progression,” Liu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT &lt;/em&gt;had the opportunity to speak with &lt;a href="https://www.gwsvision.com/eye-doctors/david-geffen-od/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;David I. Geffen&lt;/a&gt;, OD, FAAO, director of optometric and refractive services at the Gordon Schanzlin New Vision in La Jolla, CA, about this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study finds an interesting association with instant coffee and AMD,” Geffen, who was not involved in the research, commented. “With our population living longer, AMD is one of the leading disabilities in the senior population. Any change in lifestyle to minimize this risk is well worth exploring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the large increase in AMD seen in [the United States] it is important to continue with vital research in this area,” he added. “The costs associated with caring and treating AMD patients it is worthwhile to find ways to minimize the risk associated with this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geffen said that while he found this research interesting, he would need to see a more direct association before he would tell patients not to drink instant coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Questions like how much instant were being consumed by those individuals with AMD. Also, is social economic class associated with this? Is there some lifestyle associated with the risk in these individuals? This is way too early to make large assumptions about instant coffee drinking.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/benjamin-b-bert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Benjamin Bert&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this research, who shared that it fascinated him in two different ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First the study demonstrates one of the future directions of medicine that we have been hearing about: directing care based off of someone’s specific DNA risk profile,” Bert, who was not involved in the research, explained. “In this study they found that people have a higher risk of dry AMD with certain genetic markers and consumption of instant coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Which brings the second fascinating part of the study, food as medicine,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More and more we are realizing how our food and drink choices can impact our overall health. This study once again points to the dangers of highly &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318630" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, like dehydrated instant coffee, compared to its more natural form of brewed coffee, which had no added risks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Benjamin Bert, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With additional research, it would be beneficial to know other foods that could be risks for these patients,” Bert added. “Is instant coffee the only food risk? Does the conclusion of this study apply to all highly processed foods?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 05:09:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPekFwMzZMTDdEY2tVTzZCYnVTYlJlOE1pVV9GU2tpRWtJZGpVVXViZWIwTzRjS3c5S1h3cHdoeExISXlURmVRenpMRC1EcTlHM3pUc3lDVDZ0clBRY3RRb0trSlJSQnBOdVFvOXRYdzlxRXllalNuQ2VseUtmTEpKR0FQclNfSTVXUDlmM01nR2pEdERrVW1yc1p3</guid></item><item><title>专家对每天不亲密的情侣发出紧急警告...因为他们揭示了隐藏的风险-每日邮报 | Experts' urgent warning to couples who aren't intimate every day... as they reveal hidden risk - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Leading relationship experts are revealing the potential dangers of skipping daily intimacy - warning couples it could lead to the demise of their relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they're not talking about sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mariah Freya, sex education expert and co-founder of Beducated, a sex-education platform, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-2837203/Kissing-ten-seconds-passes-80m-bugs-keeps-healthy.html"&gt;urging couples to kiss more&lt;/a&gt;, especially if they feel the relationship is lacking a spark. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Kissing is the most underrated relationship tool. Couples obsess over date nights, whether they're having 'enough' sex, and communication techniques, but they're sleeping on the one thing that actually predicts whether they'll stay happy together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freya claims that couples who regularly indulge in kissing each other instead of settling for pecks tend to have less conflict, an increased desire for intimacy and better emotional connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it seems that research supports her as previous studies have found a correlation between kissing and relationship satisfaction.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study found how frequently a couple kisses is a strong indicator of both sexual and relationship satisfaction - the more couples kissed, the happier they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the researchers also found that regular kissing can reduce anxiety and improve overall relationship quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Freya continued: 'Something magical happens when we stop going about kissing in a mechanical way and really focus on it, even if it's for a few seconds more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's when your brain shifts from 'greeting mode' to 'connection mode.' Your partner literally becomes more attractive to you.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers found that regular kissing can reduce anxiety and improve overall relationship quality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But not all couples are indulging in the simple act of love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2011 survey found that one in five married couples don't pucker-up with their partner for an entire week, while two in five married people lock lips for just five seconds or less when they do kiss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surprisingly, those between the ages of 18 to 24 kiss each other on an average of 11 times per week and five percent of people aged over 45 are managing over 31 kisses each week. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while many may blame busy schedules as the reason why they aren't kissing their partners, Brie Temple, CCO and Chief Matchmaker at Tawkify, warns that it may be a sign of 'something deeper'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'If kissing fades, it's a subtle sign that something deeper is shifting. It's one of the first signs of emotional disconnection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without those soft moments, partners may find themselves feeling like roommates rather than lovers. It's not just an absence of physical touch, but an absence of shared emotional language that keeps relationships close.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a lack of kissing between partners may also be a sign of waning physical intimacy, communication challenges and worsening self-esteem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A lack of kissing between partners may also be a sign of waning physical intimacy, communication challenges and worsening self-esteem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sunaree Ko, a Love &amp;amp; Compatibility Expert at TarotCards told DailyMail.com: 'A lack of kissing over time can chip away at intimacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When physical affection fades, couples may start to feel emotionally disconnected, misread each other’s intentions or feel undervalued, especially during stressful periods.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while infrequent kissing combined with issues such as mistrust and other negative emotions may indicate serious cracks in the relationship, simply taking some time out to smooch may do wonders for you and your partner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Sofie Roos, a licensed sexologist and relationship therapist, kissing can release a cocktail of good hormones including oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin in the brain which can help improve the emotional connection between a couple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told DailyMail.com: 'Oxytocin, also known as the love hormone, which creates feelings of safety, calmness, attachment and affection - in other words: the feeling of being in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By getting oxytocin triggered by your partner through kisses, you have higher chances of keeping the love and attraction alive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Kissing also releases dopamine, called the feel good hormone, which makes us feel overall satisfied since it creates an euphoric feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dopamine is the same hormone being released during an orgasm or exercising, but also when taking drugs such as cocaine and heroin, and by getting it from kissing your partner, you get a natural high that not only feels good but that also can maintain the flame and the romantic interest for the person!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Serotonin is the third hormone being released in this hormone cocktail which is dancing in your body while kissing your loved one.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roos continued: 'Serotonin prevents feeling down and depressed, it helps us sleep better, and it also makes us less impulsive and more stable - all factors making our life quality better, as well as making us a better partner!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This natural high is created when all the sensitive nerves on our lips and tongue register the physical stimulation from the kissing and then sends the signals to the brain, which releases the hormones directly in our bloodstream.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, Ko claims that &lt;span&gt;kissing your partner at certain times of the day can help maximize the benefits of the activity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Some of the most successful couples credit a simple ritual of kissing first thing in the morning and last thing at night as their secret to staying emotionally connected, no matter how busy life gets.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a small act with a huge energetic impact, a daily affirmation of love, desire, and loyalty. Even when words fail, a kiss can realign a couple's bond on both a physical and spiritual level.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Weight loss and diabetes jabs taken by more than a million people in the UK have been linked to a potential serious side effect, with some deaths, according to data from the UK medicines regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New figures from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) show the group of drugs that includes Mounjaro, Wegovy, and Ozempic may be associated with inflammation of the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the MHRA, there have been 181 reported cases of acute or chronic pancreatitis linked to Mounjaro, with five deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wegovy and Ozempic have been linked with 113 reports of pancreatitis and one death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other, less widely used versions of so-called GLP-1 drugs have also been linked to cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that the drugs directly caused the deaths. And the evidence isn't strong enough for the MHRA to restrict access.&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;div class="sdc-article-widget sdc-site-video callfn" data-account-id="6058004172001" data-amp-iframe-embed="" data-asset-id="79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-asset-path="" data-asset-version="" data-autoplay="false" data-auth-config="" data-caption="Weight loss drugs compared" data-clip-type="" data-component-name="sdc-site-video" data-component-name-alias="ui-sitewide-video" data-competition="" data-copy-url-text="URL copied to clipboard" data-fn="sdc-site-video" data-id="id_79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-is-live-stream="false" data-lite="true" data-options="" data-originator-id="51" data-originator-handle="brightcove-news-gb" data-package-name="" data-provider="brightcove" data-player-id="yjBoKQ5XA" data-playsinline="" data-sensitive="false" data-sdc-id="6913960" data-sdc-video-id="79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-sport-category="" data-state="loading" data-token-state="none" data-video-ad-unit="" data-video-blacklisted-originator-ids="" data-video-id="ref:79515574-afb5-448f-860e-21fb52b9103f" data-video-type="" data-auto-pause-on-not-visible="true" tabindex="-1" data-closed-captions-position="middle-third" data-show-closed-captions="true" data-show-pip="true" data-show-live-stream-scrubber="true" data-autoload="false"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's because pancreatitis also occurs in people who aren't taking the GLP-1 drugs, with about 560 cases for every one million people in the general population. Gallstones and alcohol are the biggest causes.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;But the MHRA and Genomics England are launching a new study to see whether some people have genes that put them at higher risk of developing pancreatitis if they take GLP-1 drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People reported through the MHRA's 'yellow card' alert system to have pancreatitis while using the jabs will be asked to provide a saliva sample and their genes tested.&lt;/p&gt;        
&lt;p&gt;Professor Matt Brown, chief scientific officer of Genomics England, said: "GLP-1 medicines like Ozempic and Wegovy have been making headlines, but like all medicines, there can be a risk of serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe there is real potential to minimise these, with many adverse reactions having a genetic cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This next step in our partnership with the MHRA will generate data and evidence for safer and more effective treatment through more personalised approaches to prescription."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="sdc-article-widget sdc-article-image"&gt;

        &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main symptoms of pancreatitis are severe pain in the centre of the tummy area, fever and nausea. Acute cases are treated in hospital with fluids and oxygen, and generally make a recovery within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there can be complications, and around 5% of acute cases are fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all medicines, there is a balance of risk and benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with type 2 &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/diabetes-6941" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/obesity-7171" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are clear benefits to using the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They lower blood sugar levels, lead to rapid weight loss and reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease by a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/weight-loss-jab-warning-from-health-watchdog-over-unborn-babies-13379102" target="_blank"&gt;Weight loss jab warning from watchdog over unborn babies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/gps-can-prescribe-weight-loss-jabs-on-the-nhs-from-today-but-strict-eligibility-criteria-in-place-13387265" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPs can prescribe weight loss jabs on the NHS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/from-ozempic-to-mounjaro-the-diabetes-drugs-repurposed-as-weight-loss-wonders-12823419" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic to Wegovy - what are the weight loss injections?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     
&lt;p&gt;But for people who are a bit overweight and have sourced the jabs privately to lose a few pounds ahead of their summer holiday, the health benefits are far less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a wake-up call for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are powerful medications with effects not just on appetite, but on lots of body organs, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And pancreatitis is just one of many possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilly, the UK manufacturer of Mounjaro, has said patient safety is its "top priority".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug's patient information leaflet "warns that inflamed pancreas (acute pancreatitis) is an uncommon side effect (which may affect up to 1 in 100 people)," the statement continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily "also advises patients to talk to their doctor or other healthcare professional before using Mounjaro if they have ever had pancreatitis," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Novo Nordisk UK, which manufactures Wegovy and Ozempic, said in a statement: "Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novo Nordisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like all medications, side effects can occur and vary from patient to patient. The known risks and benefits of GLP1 medicines are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We recommend that patients take these medications only for their approved indications and under the strict supervision of a healthcare professional, who can also advise on potential side effects."&lt;/p&gt;

So, in the endless search for more treatment options, some researchers are looking in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/himalayan-fungus-drug-currently-in-human-trials-shown-to-be-potent-cancer-killer"&gt;unlikely places&lt;/a&gt; – like a scorpion's tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To speed things up, a group of researchers from Brazil have been inserting potential genes of interest into a 'factory' organism's DNA to create the gene's product. They can then test the resulting proteins, like those in scorpion venom, for various medical uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were able to identify a molecule in the species of this Amazonian scorpion that is similar to that found in the venoms of other scorpions and that acts against breast cancer cells," &lt;a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/amazon-scorpion-toxin-kills-breast-cancer-cells/55106"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; University of São Paulo pharmacologist Eliane Candiani Arantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-may-have-finally-figured-out-how-bats-avoid-cancer?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Scientists May Have Finally Figured Out How Bats Avoid Cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like chemotherapy drugs, the molecule, BamazScplp1, triggers necrosis – the process of cell death – in the breast cancer cells, causing the cells to rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165593" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Typical-work-fl-ow-for-the-heterologous-expression-of-biosynthetic-gene-clusters-Refer.png" alt="Diagram showing the process of heterologous expression" class="wp-image-165593 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Typical-work-fl-ow-for-the-heterologous-expression-of-biosynthetic-gene-clusters-Refer.png 470w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Typical-work-fl-ow-for-the-heterologous-expression-of-biosynthetic-gene-clusters-Refer-201x415.png 201w" sizes="(max-width: 470px) 100vw, 470px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165593" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;How researchers use heterologous expression to create gene products in the laboratory using model organisms like bacteria or fungi.

In this case, Arantes and colleagues used a species of yeast (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komagataella"&gt;Komagataella pastoris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) as factories for their proteins of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using techniques like these could help us track down more of nature's hidden treatments, as long as we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-report-predicts-southern-amazon-rainforest-is-heading-for-collapse-by-2064"&gt;don't destroy them first&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hart of &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania State University&lt;/a&gt; conducted the study with 138 adults who already carried at least one metabolic syndrome risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-pecans-the-basics"&gt;Understanding pecans – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecans (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/misc/ag_654/volume_2/carya/illinoesis.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carya illinoinensis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) are a species of hickory native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, prized for their nutrient-dense nuts and economic value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botanically classified as drupes, pecans develop from a flower with a single ovary and encase their edible seed in a hard shell within a green husk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tree thrives in well-drained alluvial soils and requires a temperate climate with warm summers and cold winters to complete its dormancy cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have studied its genome to improve traits such as disease resistance, drought tolerance, and nut quality, which are crucial as climate variability intensifies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecan trees can live for over a century and often require a decade or more before producing commercially viable yields, making early-stage cultivation decisions critical for long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linking-pecans-and-low-cholesterol"&gt;Linking pecans and low cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers randomized volunteers into two groups. One group kept its usual &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/midnight-snack-the-best-foods-for-a-good-nights-sleep/"&gt;snack&lt;/a&gt; pattern, while the other replaced whatever chips or cookies they normally grabbed with raw, unsalted pecans, &lt;em&gt;Carya illinoinensis&lt;/em&gt;, measured to 57 grams a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the final blood draw, the pecan group’s LDL, often nicknamed “bad” cholesterol, fell by 7 mg/dL, and &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=56&amp;amp;contentid=2967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;triglycerides&lt;/a&gt; slid by 16 mg/dL, whereas the control numbers barely budged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant changes appeared in blood pressure or flow‑mediated dilation, so the nut’s magic seems aimed squarely at lipids rather than vessel stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-inside-the-body"&gt;What happens inside the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecans supply roughly 12 grams of heart‑friendly monounsaturated fat in a one‑ounce handful, plus a spectrum of polyphenols and 34 mg of magnesium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologist &lt;a href="https://www.texasheart.org/people/matthew-segar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthew Segar&lt;/a&gt; of the Texas Heart Institute explains, “They also suppress post‑meal triglyceride spikes, which is especially important because temporary fat surges can contribute to heart disease over time,” said Segar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oleic acid, the same fatty acid abundant in olive oil, forms about 60 percent of pecan fat.  Replacing refined‑carbohydrate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dips-can-more-than-double-the-calories-of-your-favorite-snack/"&gt;snacks&lt;/a&gt; with this fatty acid profile can decrease hepatic very‑low‑density lipoprotein synthesis, cutting the pool of LDL precursors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cholesterol-numbers-behind-pecans"&gt;Cholesterol numbers behind pecans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average total‑cholesterol drop of 3.6 percent in Hart’s trial might look small, yet a 5 mg/dL LDL reduction translates to a roughly 4 percent cut in cardiovascular event risk over five years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An updated meta‑analysis pooling more than 50 nut trials shows similar lipid shifts across various tree nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would interpret this trial as confirmation that replacing unhealthy snacks with a modest amount of healthy snacks, including nuts and pecans if you enjoy them, is one way to promote a heart‑healthy diet,” said &lt;a href="https://www.ccpdocs.com/physicians-affiliates/physicians/brett-victor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brett Victor&lt;/a&gt;, MD, Cardiology Consultants of Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because snacks account for about one‑fifth of daily calories for U.S. adults, targeting that slot offers an easy win without a complete menu overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-other-health-benefits"&gt;Other health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart’s team noted a nine‑point jump in Healthy Eating Index scores among pecan eaters, indicating better overall diet quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber climbed by three grams a day and added‑sugar intake fell, echoing &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; advice to emphasize nutrient‑dense plant foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ellagic acid in pecans reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, and flavonoids improve blood vessel function, promoting better circulation and cardiovascular wellness,” said preventive dietitian &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, RD&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those anti‑inflammatory touches could help explain observational data linking higher nut consumption, five servings a week or more, to 13 percent lower cardiovascular disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-putting-pecans-on-the-plate"&gt;Putting pecans on the plate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two ounces works out to roughly 30–35 halves. Sprinkle them over oatmeal, blend into a smoothie, or just keep a small reusable container in your bag; consistency matters more than recipe creativity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stick with raw or dry‑roasted pieces to avoid excess sodium and sugar. If flavor boredom strikes, toss them with cinnamon, smoked &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/spicy-foods-can-slow-down-eating-and-cut-calorie-intake/"&gt;paprika&lt;/a&gt;, or a dash of cocoa powder before roasting at 300 °F for ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People watching weight should remember that two ounces deliver about 390 calories. Hart’s participants gained only 1.5 pounds on average, likely because nuts increase satiety, but portion mindfulness still counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone should jump straight into a daily two‑ounce pecan habit without checking their own health context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/nut-allergies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nut allergies&lt;/a&gt;, especially tree nut sensitivities, must avoid pecans entirely, as even trace amounts can trigger severe reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecans are also high in caloric density, which can be an issue for those on calorie‑restricted diets. Adding them without adjusting for other energy sources could lead to gradual weight gain, as observed in some participants in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pecans-cholesterol-and-heart-health"&gt;Pecans, cholesterol, and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree‑nut research now spans controlled feeding trials, long‑term cohorts, and mechanistic studies on endothelial function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they paint a converging picture: regular nut eaters boast healthier lipid profiles and slightly leaner waistlines than non‑nut eaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing just one daily serving of highly processed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/baby-carrots-snack-your-way-to-better-health/"&gt;snacks&lt;/a&gt; with a handful of pecans checks multiple boxes, lower carbs, higher fiber, plant protein, and a bundle of antioxidants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors caution that nuts complement rather than replace statins or lifestyle pillars like exercise, yet this simple swap stands out as one of nutrition’s most agreeable tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525000577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 01:02:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNTlVxXzkyemJEd014MDg3cm9WV0hzYkNMZU1qUGZ4MUh4akMxR1lFdFpmWGxMRDh5bm1ENkZxV054UnljSTlhZF9WQmV3eWRScF8ySnZnSGI2M1VhQnhwa09QNGI1eU5UUjF2dlUzWGZvaTZaQy16MTU4WFNYSExwUWk0QTQ1UE5rUkVsZjB1U2J0VHZYYkpZYm5JalRYOGhzNEVteA</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，大多数快乐的夫妻基本上都在社交媒体上撒谎- YourTango | Research Says Most Happy Couples Are Basically Lying About This On Social Media - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxORElpdG1EWjVuSmJIbmFsWlVPb1NsMXVxQTREQmFhZEdpT2pEeloydkF4REoyeDNRMXpYN0FwRkc1WFR6SE1HX1ZtUUk4dHNXazBYTlJiQzFjUDk2cTJSNktUS0tPbXc5VkpfMFNmWm1uTFRUWTVaNzRrNmwyZGhzRFhvNnJqaEFLaGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the man who broke my heart was officially out of my life, after a long and dramatic goodbye that lasted longer than it should have, I took to Instagram to recover. We had blocked each other on social media, but at least with Instagram, I could prove to him that I had moved on and was happy, that is, if he was so inclined to look at my account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My thinking was that although I was dying inside, I would post photos of just how wonderful my life was without him. I had run off to Paris to recover from the heartbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/rather-travel-world-ever-have-kids"&gt;and traveled around Europe for a bit,&lt;/a&gt; all the while posting photos of me with a smile on my face as I indulged in pizza in Italy, sangria in Barcelona, and spring in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was how I was going to prove to not just him, but to myself, that &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/if-you-cant-get-over-him-do-things-immediately"&gt;I was capable of a life that didn’t include him&lt;/a&gt;. After a while, I finally convinced myself that I was. I don’t know if he ever snooped around my Instagram, but I want to believe he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instagram, as well as other forms of social media, have become a place where people either show only the great parts of their lives or complain and moan about how awful everything is &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/personality-clues-person-insecure-attention-seeker"&gt;in the hopes of getting attention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it seems like that latter group would be the most annoying, in reality, it's all those "happy" people who irk us. A&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2014/09/facebook-posts-reflect-relationship-insecurity.html" rel="nofollow"&gt; 2014 study&lt;/a&gt; shows that those happy people aren't all that happy after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;According to research, most happy couples are lying about how happy they really are on social media.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/big-lie-most-happy-looking-couples-tell-social-media.png" alt="man telling lies on social media" title="the big lie most happy-looking couples tell on social media" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Chinnapong / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/painfully-honest-reasons-social-media-causes-relationship-problems"&gt;7 Painfully Honest Reasons Why Social Media Causes Relationship Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The study found that the more insecure the couple was in their relationship, the more they pretended to be happy on social media.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167214549944?icid=int.sj-full-text.similar-articles.8" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, found that when &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habits-signal-lack-security-relationship"&gt;people are dealing with relationship insecurity&lt;/a&gt;, they're more likely to post "more relationship-relevant" statuses and photos on social media. In addition, people who are just generally anxious also tend to do the same. It's the whole "smile, though your heart is aching" concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting to prove that things are better than they are makes total sense. I've always wondered why people take to TikTok to air their dirty laundry and complain about how their &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/if-you-think-hes-cheating-what-immediately-to-do"&gt;boyfriend just cheated on them&lt;/a&gt;, and this has happened more than a few times, and they’ve just suffered a miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that in such situations, people want to share their grief, but I’m also of the belief that social media is not the platform for such things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/entertainment/what-anniversary-posts-social-media-reveal-about-couples-relationship"&gt;What A Couple's Anniversary Post On Social Media Reveals About Their Relationship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;But painting your life on social media as one big, rosy highlight reel is a bit deluded.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or is it? Perhaps it's hopeful to look at the sunny side of life, even in your darkest moments. Just like it was hopeful of me posting photos of myself on a yacht in the Hamptons &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/heartbreak/how-to-get-over-a-breakup"&gt;after my break-up&lt;/a&gt;, even if the truth was that I was crying into my glass of champagne when the camera wasn’t on me.

It doesn't feel real," says Charlie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She admits being anxious all the way through her pregnancy until June was safely in  her arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Even the pregnancy scans were a new experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We'd never seen anything on a scan before that moved," she says. "When they said 'I can see it, it's in the right place', we both burst into tears."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Anyone can refer themselves to the clinic, but it has a long waiting list and funding issues mean patients must contribute to the cost of the test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Jyotsna Vohra, director of research at Tommy's, said care and treatment for those who experience pregnancy or baby loss varied unacceptably across the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There should be no barriers to accessing any test or treatment that has been proven to make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We hope NHS decision-makers will look carefully at the results of the Coventry pilot project and consider rolling this test out nationwide, so that everyone who might benefit has that opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Muter says the next step is to use the test to assess potential drug treatments. Sitagliptin, usually used to treat diabetes, is the go-to option for womb lining issues but there may be other existing drugs which can be repurposed, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;With 80% of drugs not tested on pregnant women, it's unclear which ones might be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 00:01:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5yVWVpNmpfWjFsRzltUk5BcTIwR1MzX3BWcXFGWTduMktpRmxhaElRUE44aEJLejAxVkRBalBOM2liTS1pMVpJWTRGUVVlWWNFS1luSzVTVkdlZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE5SX1ltRmFTc1BxbTFNbmhhbUUtNFlfUkhkTkJqX3RZVGk2dEFhd2Q3Q0ZGRkxtUEVmYkNaLXc1dFVBd3VOVWx1TFhadC03TGlDLUlpRGNydXladFZKcmVz</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，您的血型会影响您早期中风的风险- ScienceAlert | Your Blood Type Affects Your Risk of an Early Stroke, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPSzJRRGpiOF9ZQ3hXU213NGdMSG9MS0hUVm5CY2RYYTBreGZyWEpjTmh3VnBBN1lsNkRzQVpNbFBMaFV2RWtXb0hBN3BwZDFfLTYzVS1KeWNCMEh2MUdyOHdXZVgxWi1uN3pyanNIN0tsTEFYYVdwZ0ZqZG5lUzIzd2FQQmpUcTJWVzRqS0h4Um1COFBkWmd6QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Research suggests a surprising link between blood type and stroke risk, with people carrying one specific group A blood type facing a higher likelihood of stroke before age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding, published in 2022, deepens our understanding of how our unique biological makeup can impact our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard of the A, B, AB, and O groups, which refer to the various chemical markers, known as antigens, found on the surface of our red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg" alt="Diagram of ABO blood groups and the IgM antibodies present in each." class="size-full wp-image-140271" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood type is partly determined by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.

All participants were between the ages of 18 and 59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed a clear relationship between the gene responsible for the A1 blood subgroup, and early-onset stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genome-wide search revealed two locations strongly associated with an earlier risk of stroke. One coincided with the spot where genes for blood type sit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second analysis of specific types of blood-type gene then found people whose genome coded for a variation of the A group had a 16 percent higher chance of a stroke before the age 60, compared with a population of other blood types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with a gene for group O1, the risk was lower by 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted, however, that the additional risk of stroke in people with type A blood is small, so there is no need for extra vigilance or screening in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still don't know why blood type A would confer a higher risk," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963353"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; senior author and vascular neurologist Steven Kittner from the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the blood vessels as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study findings may seem alarming – that blood type could change early stroke risk – let's put these results into context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year in the US just under 800,000 individuals experience a stroke. Most of these events – around &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535078/"&gt;three out of every four&lt;/a&gt; – occur in people 65 years and older, with risks doubling every decade after the age of 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the people included in the study lived in North America, Europe, Japan, Pakistan, and Australia, with people of non-European ancestry only making up 35 percent of participants. Future studies with a more diverse sample could help clarify the significance of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We clearly need more follow-up studies to clarify the mechanisms of increased stroke risk," Kittner &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963353"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding of the study came from comparing people who had a stroke before the age of 60 to those that had a stroke after the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this, the researchers used a dataset of about 9,300 people over the age of 60 who had a stroke, and some 25,000 controls over the age of 60 who didn't have a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the increased risk of stroke in the type A blood group became insignificant in the late-onset stroke group, suggesting that strokes that happen early in life may have a different mechanism compared to those that occur later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strokes in younger people are less likely to be caused by a build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries (a process called atherosclerosis) and more likely to be caused by factors to do with clot formation, the authors &lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/99/16/e1738"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that people with type B blood were around 11 percent more likely to have a stroke compared to non-stroke controls regardless of their age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.784"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that the part of the genome that codes for blood type, called the 'ABO locus', is associated with coronary artery calcification, which restricts blood flow, and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic sequence for A and B blood types have also been associated with a slightly higher risk of blood clots in veins, called venous thrombosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2022/08/31/WNL.0000000000201006"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            A century ago, one of the biggest &lt;a href="https://scispace.com/pdf/the-hazards-of-immunization-3ps0h5suhg.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;safety concerns&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines involved bacterial contamination. In 1916, four young children died in South Carolina after receiving typhoid vaccine that had been contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Twelve years later, 12 children in Queensland, Australia, died from tainted immunizations against diphtheria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmccklfmq00053b6mvnf3amap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the 1930s, vaccine makers began using a preservative called thimerosal to stave off microbial growth in their products. For the next six decades, it didn’t receive much notice; ill effects appeared limited to minor local injection-site reactions, according to the US Food and Drug Administration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0005356mh4k6egvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That changed in 1999, when US health officials asked pharmaceutical companies to remove thimerosal from vaccines. There was no evidence that it caused harm in the quantities used, but thimerosal contains a form of mercury, and questions had emerged about whether it could cause neurotoxicity when given in childhood vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0006356mvc61vd0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine makers have removed it from all but a few shots, such as multidose vials of flu vaccine. In the meantime, subsequent studies have confirmed no link between thimerosal in vaccines and neurodevelopmental issues, including autism, and autism rates have continued to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0007356m4p1ym41u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So public health experts were puzzled when the preservative appeared on the agenda for this week’s meeting of outside vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0008356mc0bv7vyv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I actually don’t know any pediatric practices that even use that multidose influenza vaccine,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Colorado and former liaison to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0009356m1wnianqn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The group is meeting on Wednesday and Thursday for the first time since US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;dismissed &lt;/a&gt;the committee’s previous 17 members, claiming they had conflicts of interest, and days later installed eight new advisers. Public health experts and lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/kennedy-vaccine-panel-pressure-warren-cassidy"&gt;called into question&lt;/a&gt; the credentials and backgrounds of some of the new panelists, and just before the meeting began, one member withdrew during the financial holdings review, an HHS spokesman said, bringing the panel down to seven.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pkt7300003b6m63k02sy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A presentation “regarding thimerosal in vaccines” is scheduled for Thursday morning, followed by “proposed recommendations” specifically about thimerosal in flu vaccines, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-06-23.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; posted Monday. The meeting is scheduled to conclude with a vote on the latter, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; that could lead to official CDC policy if adopted by agency leadership – or, without a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/23/health/cdc-vaccine-advisers-meeting-cassidy"&gt;confirmed director&lt;/a&gt; in place, by Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000a356mp0k2ib24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The last-minute addition of thimerosal to the agenda was a red flag for vaccine experts, who consider the science settled and fear that Kennedy – who &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; an anti-vaccine group called Children’s Health Defense – is seeking to sow doubt about vaccine safety. Another former Children’s Health Defense leader, Lyn Redwood, is slated to make a presentation on the topic at the meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000b356mluk6aumy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s how thimerosal became such a hot-button issue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000d356m5n8eotlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1997, Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat concerned about mercury pollution in his community’s lakes and rivers, attached an amendment to a US Food and Drug Administration reauthorization bill that would require the agency to catalogue intentionally introduced mercury compounds in drugs and food.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000e356mwh4d1pk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That led to a possibly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;startling discovery: “As people looked in vaccines, there was the potential that, by six months of age, infants could have received more thimerosal than was listed in several sources of what was considered safe levels of mercury,” said Dr. Walter Orenstein, who was director of the National Immunization Program at the CDC at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000f356mnflu3t73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But those limits were set for methylmercury, the kind found in some fish, which is known to be toxic. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, a different compound that’s “intrinsically less stable, and more readily metabolized, than methylmercury,” said Dr. Matthew Rand, an associate professor in the Department of Environmental Medicine at the University of Rochester who studies mercury toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000g356mcsrnbx70@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means it’s cleared from the body more quickly than methylmercury, according to the CDC, “and is therefore less likely to cause any harm.” The FDA notes that there were no existing guidelines for ethylmercury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000h356myvbnzuhn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, the finding led to a number of emergency meetings among federal health officials and outside groups to determine what should be done, Orenstein recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “While there was no evidence of harm from thimerosal, the general feeling was, ‘let’s get rid of it, because we don’t need it,’ ” he said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Moving to single-dose containers alleviated the need for a preservative, although it came at a higher expense for manufacturers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000j356mm8qqcuv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1999, the FDA sent a letter to manufacturers of US vaccines requesting their plans to remove thimerosal, and by 2001, the compound had been removed from or reduced in all vaccines routinely recommended for children under 6 in the US, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000k356mzecddtkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The message from public health agencies, Orenstein said, was “we’re going to make safe vaccines even safer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000m356muyw1p1x6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the die was cast. Vaccines had already been tied to autism in 1998 by British doctor Andrew Wakefield, who published a since-&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/02/lancet.retraction.autism/index.html"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; paper that claimed the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine was linked to autism, although not because of thimerosal – the MMR vaccine never contained the preservative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000n356m5v8g4l3m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, parents of children with autism were seeking answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9q1col00043b6m3f0u81e6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of those parents was Redwood, who said that in 1999, she tallied up her son’s mercury exposure and found “at two months of age, he had received 125 times his allowable exposure to mercury based on EPA’s guidelines in his weight.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000o356mwq2ztmtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That was a real answer for me,” Redwood said in a &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/events/the-autism-cover-up-simpsonwood-scandal-25-years-of-fraud-and-corruption/thimerosal-simpsonwood-safeminds-lyn-redwood/" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted by Children’s Health Defense this month, “because my son at this time was almost 5 years old, and he had regressed developmentally after his first year of life and was diagnosed with autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000p356m02wkaj9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Redwood, a nurse practioner, decided to become an advocate, speaking at events and publishing papers about thimerosal and autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000r356mlgvdnqt6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The uproar over a potential link between thimerosal and autism came as a surprise to Orenstein and colleagues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000s356mcrejhtge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Mercury itself had never been implicated as a major cause of autism,” Orenstein said. “But this was a major, major concern.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000t356mraqanzmc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It led to a number of studies of the issue, including a 2004 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20669467/" target="_blank"&gt;assessment&lt;/a&gt; by the Institute of Medicine (now &lt;a href="https://nam.edu/about-the-nam/" target="_blank"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; as the National Academy of Medicine) that concluded “the body of epidemiological evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.” It made the same conclusion for MMR vaccines and autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000u356muqvidsq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2010 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20837594/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC also found no link. And “even after thimerosal was removed from almost all childhood vaccines, autism rates continued to increase,” the agency noted, “which is the opposite of what would be expected if thimerosal caused autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000v356mcn7m30fv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, those who continued to push the disproven autism connection included Kennedy, who published a book in 2014 called “Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak.” Its subtitle calls for the “immediate removal of mercury – a known neurotoxin – from vaccines.” It rejects the findings of the 2004 Institute of Medicine report and warns that millions of children in the US and around the world “appear to be at risk of injury from the thimerosal in vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000w356mu5igi0sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thimerosal is still present in “a small percentage of flu vaccines, confined to multidose vials,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project/viewpoint-cdcs-upcoming-vaccine-advisory-meeting-set-sow-distrust" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group focused on countering vaccine misinformation that was started at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, or CIDRAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000x356ma38f6j1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The group suspects that thimerosal is included on ACIP’s agenda this week – with a presentation by Redwood and a vote by the committee – “to put greater focus on and generate more public discussion about vaccine risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug000y356mjext9xul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS didn’t return a request for comment about Redwood’s involvement in this week’s meeting, and Redwood declined to comment. Her presentation &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/05-influenza-redwood-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;, however, were posted ahead of the meeting and continued to claim thimerosal presents safety risks. One slide initially included in the presentation cited a study in animals that appeared not to exist; its apparent lead author &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/cdc-vaccine-adviser-thimerosal-presentation"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;CNN he’d published a study with a similar title, but in a different journal, in different animals, and with dramatically different findings — ones that didn’t appear to show a link between autism and thimerosal. The slide presentation was subsequently updated to remove that slide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcbwg3jk0000356m7le45aph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC staff also posted its own &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/Thimerosal-Containing-Vaccines-Summary-of-Evidence-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;review &lt;/a&gt;of the data, citing nearly two dozen studies showing “the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcc30y8i00003b6my84mzqat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During her Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Dr. Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CDC, said, “I have not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0011356ms66k0ofe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision to remove thimerosal from most vaccines, despite no evidence of harm, had other consequences. At the same time the FDA made its request to vaccine makers, US health authorities advised that babies born to mothers known to be negative for hepatitis B not receive a shot for that virus at birth, but at two months to 6 months of age, as thimerosal was phased out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0012356mohamwqlu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But about 10% of hospitals “suspended use of the hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, regardless of their level of risk,” wrote Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s outside advisory committee on vaccines, in a 2007 perspective &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp078187" target="_blank"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. “One three-month-old child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of overwhelming infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0013356myj5esyxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Orenstein looks back on the decision to remove thimerosal as a hard one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0014356mbqkl0x57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fear would be keeping it in there, doing a study over two or three years and then it showed harm, and lo and behold, for three years, we used this vaccine and this component was harmful,” he said. “Since we didn’t know what the results would be of any of the studies at the time, we thought it better to just get it out of there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0015356mu36p9zj1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The autism issue,” he added, “didn’t play any role in the initial decision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmc9pjaug0016356m074ywi5r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina hospitals are on the lookout for patients
with symptoms of measles after the first reported case in the state this week. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state health department confirmed on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-first-measles-case-june-2025/"&gt;a
child in the Greensboro area tested positive for measles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state reported the child had visited several public spaces
since becoming infected and is encouraging others who were in the area to
monitor for symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Triangle-area hospitals tell WRAL they are on alert for any
patient who may be the next suspected measles case.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been working hard for months to prepare for an
outbreak of measles or multiple outbreaks at once,” said Dr. David Wohl with
UNC Health. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wohl, an infectious disease specialist, told WRAL the confirmed
case didn’t come as a surprise. He added it is likely the state will see even
more cases because of how contagious the virus is.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“This was inevitable. We knew that eventually we would get a
case here as well,” Wohl said. “Measles is an incredibly infectious virus. It
can linger in the air; it can linger on surfaces. People born before 1957, we
basically assume you are immune because it was so widespread and it is so
catchy, that it’s almost impossible that you weren’t exposed before the
vaccines became available.”&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;In 2000, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; declared measles had been eliminated from the U.S.,
meaning the only new cases were being reported from individuals traveling from
other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Smith, Duke Health Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious
Diseases, shared the concern with new outbreaks 25 years later lies with fewer
children being fully vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith explained vaccine misinformation which increased during
the pandemic, including unfounded claims the MMR vaccine was tied to cases of autism,
may be contributing to lower vaccination rates among kids in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Until this year where we’ve had a lot of measles, as a
parent you could say ‘Well measles is not really common in the United States so
I’m not going to worry about it,” Smith said. “That story is not true. The MMR
vaccine does not cause autism. Don’t take it from me as a doctor – I’m a dad
and both my kids are vaccinated. This is a safe and effective vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith advised parents that not vaccinating their children may
increase their child’s risk of getting severely ill. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Measles can make you very sick. Best case scenario, you
feel awful and it’s like the worst cold of your life,” Smith warned. “There
really is no treatment for this, despite what you may be hearing in the media
these days. The vaccine really is the most important thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;More than 1,220 measles cases and three deaths have been
reported across the United States this year, according to the CDC. The agency
reports 95% of cases occurred in individuals who were unvaccinated or whose
vaccination status was not known. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wohl and Smith agree communication between hospital staff,
clinicians, urgent cares, pediatric offices and health departments will be
crucial to identifying, and slowing potential outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Not everybody who has measles presents as a rash, often
times they present with a really high fever or a sore throat or red eyes,” Wohl
explained. “We have to sensitize people who might be the first folks who see
some of these cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Smith added families with upcoming travel plans and have not
been vaccinated should be on high alert. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We know now there is a case in our state,” Smith
said. “There’s no doubt if you’re traveling through any airport you’re going to
come in contact with somebody who may have been exposed to measles, the best
thing you can do is get vaccinated.”

The mosquitoes were collected on June 11 as part of the state’s routine surveillance program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made Tuesday by the Connecticut Mosquito Management Program, which includes several state agencies responsible for monitoring mosquito-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is one of the earlier detections of the virus recorded during the past 25 years of the statewide monitoring program,” said John Shepard, medical entomologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Philip Armstrong, chief scientist at the CAES, said recent rainfall and ongoing heat are likely to increase mosquito activity and the spread of the virus. He urged residents to use mosquito repellents, cover exposed skin, and avoid outdoor activity during dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of mosquito bites, residents are advised to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Use EPA-registered mosquito repellents &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Ensure window and door screens are in good condition &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Use mosquito netting when sleeping outdoors or protecting children in strollers &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CAES operates 108 trapping stations in 88 municipalities across the state. Traps are rotated weekly, with increased frequency following any detection of viruses. Test results and public health alerts are shared with local health departments and &lt;a href="https://portal.ct.gov/mosquito" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;posted online here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mosquito surveillance and response effort is a collaboration between CAES, the Department of Public Health, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, the Department of Agriculture, and the Connecticut Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory at UConn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 22:12:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科莫金县报告2例麻疹确诊病例 | 2 confirmed measles cases reported in King County - KOMO</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6wFBVV95cUxPeGVYT2lteDdYUHh5TlNjaGNzeWZmc25lZVRiVjRtdEJpUEZNNzd1dE9pcDhXUUlxNWhxTjVMZHpwYUlNMWFrclY2aXdydXZLSmROUHZwNDNuREotd1B3d21vZU5HNTFFSnMyVm9oZ2szRW5uLWg5SFJBRmN6N28ycTM2VkdyUVREaFNJeHUycUNMd0VyZ1pvTEZRMXYwd213VGs1d25UeFR4YWVIeXplemo5LXgwRFU4SHlnaTdUNlFMWlJvclJUalVydXB4a3VFR1hJN1B3Vy1LM3N4S1I5WExTNUN6dFdIcDZZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SEATTLE — &lt;/span&gt;There are two new measles cases in King County, after Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County confirmed that a child and their adult family member have the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the two live in the same household and visited multiple locations throughout the county while they were infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two were likely exposed while hosting an international visitor who reported feeling ill, Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County wrote in a release.

Health officials said that means the risk to the public is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were in the exposure areas at the listed times, public health said you should first check your MMR vaccination records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop an illness with a fever or unexplained rash, call a healthcare provider immediately. Officials said to call before going to a clinic or hospital to limit contact with others, especially those without known immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not up to date on vaccinations and were at any of the locations at the times listed, public health said &lt;strong&gt;you would become sick between June 21 and July 13.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are immunocompromised may take longer than that date range to experience symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/canadian-confirmed-measles-case-sea-tac-airport-vaccination-status-king-county-seattle-public-health-april-6-7-s-concourse-general-public-tukwila-airport-comfort-suites" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/canadian-confirmed-measles-case-sea-tac-airport-vaccination-status-king-county-seattle-public-health-april-6-7-s-concourse-general-public-tukwila-airport-comfort-suites" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Measles exposure warning issued for Sea-Tac airport and Tukwila hotel after traveler visit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About Measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease, causing fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person contracts measles, up to nine out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles are contagious four days before the rash starts through four days after the rash appears. The incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about seven to 10 days, and from exposure to rash onset is usually about 10-14 days (with a range of seven to 21 days.) People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and in rare cases, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy people can experience complications from measles, but those at highest risk include infants and children under five years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination offers safe, effective measles protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles, Providence Swedish strongly recommends that everyone receive the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles and providing long-lasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 21:55:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxPeGVYT2lteDdYUHh5TlNjaGNzeWZmc25lZVRiVjRtdEJpUEZNNzd1dE9pcDhXUUlxNWhxTjVMZHpwYUlNMWFrclY2aXdydXZLSmROUHZwNDNuREotd1B3d21vZU5HNTFFSnMyVm9oZ2szRW5uLWg5SFJBRmN6N28ycTM2VkdyUVREaFNJeHUycUNMd0VyZ1pvTEZRMXYwd213VGs1d25UeFR4YWVIeXplemo5LXgwRFU4SHlnaTdUNlFMWlJvclJUalVydXB4a3VFR1hJN1B3Vy1LM3N4S1I5WExTNUN6dFdIcDZZ</guid></item><item><title>一项新的研究表明，改变这项日常任务的一件事可以将心脏病风险降低一半- Earth.com | Changing one thing about this everyday task cuts heart disease risk in half, says a new study - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOSXMxb2RyRXM3UmRablJqbldDcjNjRWstTzU1Q3pEOC1sc3haNV9fNlBjTmhXS0NLX0xwVWhkVkFuQVJpVE1DY3ZSYTJLZVJEVHMzcE1qQTlWVDRXcnBubkJBRmJSaFNPTjhyTnNRc3Ezc0htbTJMbGpVRDFlLXZId01yQVRuSkVZeHF2RmlucnI4MXoyMWdraWJzSW43eUNINVBYLWFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease kills more Americans than any other condition, claiming about 941,652 lives in 2022. That’s nearly one out of every five deaths in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis says you can cut that danger in half simply by quickening everyday chores, and it does not require a gym membership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/emmanuel-stamatakis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emmanuel Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; led the project that quietly tracked more than 24,000 self‑described non‑exercisers with wrist‑worn motion sensors for a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-movement-and-heart-disease"&gt;Everyday movement and heart disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think of exercise as planned workouts, yet the trackers revealed that tiny bursts of motion during routine tasks, from carrying groceries to scrubbing a tub, still raise the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-or-low-fat-food-quality-is-more-important-for-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each little surge counts toward the 150 minutes of moderate activity that the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; recommends every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call this incidental physical activity (IPA), a catch‑all for movement that happens naturally while living, working, or commuting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPA sidesteps the cost, travel, and time barriers that keep roughly three in five U.S. adults from meeting exercise guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, staying seated for long stretches lets blood sugar and blood pressure creep upward, feeding &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease (CVD)&lt;/a&gt;. Over time those changes stiffen arteries and invite clots that trigger heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous large‑scale work shows that women who combine at least three different household or leisure activities cut CVD risk by forty percent compared with women who stick to only one type of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-disease-and-movement"&gt;Heart disease and movement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sydney team mined data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;, a massive project linking health records with lifestyle tracking. Participants averaged 62 years old and reported no structured workouts, yet their trackers captured every ten‑second burst of motion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An artificial‑intelligence model sorted each snippet into light, moderate, or vigorous effort. The scientists then waited almost eight years to see who suffered a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/men-and-women-have-different-heart-rhythms-and-now-we-know-why/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; event or died. Hospital records confirmed 908 major cardiac events and 223 cardiovascular deaths in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crunching the numbers showed an L‑shaped curve: risk plummeted quickly with the first bits of effort, then leveled off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily totals of just 24 minutes at a moderate clip or 4 to 5 minutes at a vigorous clip predicted roughly fifty percent fewer heart attacks or strokes compared with people who mostly ambled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/gibalam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin Gibala&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.mcmaster.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McMaster University&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved, called the work “a solid piece of evidence that even brief bursts matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-fast-is-fast-enough"&gt;How fast is fast enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate intensity means you can talk but not sing, like pushing a vacuum cleaner briskly or climbing stairs with purpose. Vigorous intensity steals your breath so that only a few words fit between gasps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, hurrying up two flights of stairs, hauling laundry in double‑time, or sprint‑walking to the mailbox three or four times a day fills that five‑minute vigorous quota. Those minutes do not need to be consecutive; the study counted them whenever they appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stamatakis’ group calculated health “exchange rates.” One vigorous minute matched about three moderate minutes or nearly forty‑five light minutes for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-is-worse-for-the-heart-than-cocaine/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; protection. That conversion helps people who dislike huffing and puffing find an alternative pace and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-adding-some-pep-to-your-step"&gt;Adding some pep to your step&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn a slow sweep into a speed sweep by widening your stance and pushing the broom in long strokes. This bumps effort into the moderate zone without special gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carry grocery bags one at a time up the driveway and time yourself. A shorter trip each night builds a habit of pacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swap the elevator for the stairs on the way to your apartment or office. The extra sixty seconds of climbing can replace a two‑minute jog later. Gardening can count too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racing the timer while pulling weeds or raking leaves lifts heart rate beyond the comfortable chatting zone. Small tweaks spread through the day avoid sweating through clothes, a leading barrier cited in surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-heart-disease-prevention"&gt;Future of heart disease prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPA does not replace structured workouts, which improve muscle strength, balance, and mental health in ways chores cannot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet for millions who struggle to meet formal goals, brisk chores close part of the gap and still leave room for weekend hikes or bike rides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-remains-leading-cause-of-death-as-key-health-risk-factors-continue-to-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that eighty percent of cardiac events are preventable through lifestyle choices like diet, activity, and smoking cessation. Quick chores could be the lowest‑cost intervention of them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors say the findings dovetail with long‑standing advice to break up sitting with movement. Every hour of desk work should end with a brief spell of standing or walking, and adding intensity multiplies the benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Biobank cohort was mostly White and middle‑aged, so future studies need to follow diverse younger groups to confirm the effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also hope to test whether digital nudges, such as phone alerts, can prompt timely bursts of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, public‑health campaigns may soon update guidelines to highlight IPA alongside formal exercise, making the message clearer for busy parents and older adults with mobility concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072253" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 21:12:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOSXMxb2RyRXM3UmRablJqbldDcjNjRWstTzU1Q3pEOC1sc3haNV9fNlBjTmhXS0NLX0xwVWhkVkFuQVJpVE1DY3ZSYTJLZVJEVHMzcE1qQTlWVDRXcnBubkJBRmJSaFNPTjhyTnNRc3Ezc0htbTJMbGpVRDFlLXZId01yQVRuSkVZeHF2RmlucnI4MXoyMWdraWJzSW43eUNINVBYLWFn</guid></item><item><title>与较少冲动行为、撞车和犯罪相关的多动症药物- STAT | ADHD medicines linked to less impulsive behavior, crashes, and crime - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQRmhEYkI4NXcxdGl1RGZiYkFyZ1dxanM5QmpnN3p0SG80ODZZU3ZlS1VwbTNDcXhXS3ZPSUlQcmd4ZGpGYmZqSC1mQlV2eGFmNjN0LUJ1SmVZbUZhMGN6dGxqejJ0TnVmdjIxRGJ0MlpFVTVIT2ZDUUVXWkRqbnBjTHUzamswb1I0MVY1NTZfMTF0dU10eC1iTmJzUzJ3dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="author-pop-over" data-author="rose-broderick"&gt;&lt;p class="author-bio"&gt;O.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study tracking nearly 250,000 Swedish people using ADHD medication for 14 years found that these treatments can &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2835661" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reduce risks&lt;/a&gt; of traffic crashes, injuries, and criminal behavior — and that conclusion remained true even as more girls, women, and adult men received a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I wish we had access to this kind of data for the U.S.,” said Ryan Sultan, who was not part of the study and is a psychiatrist and professor at Columbia University Irving Medical Center where he specializes in ADHD. “Being able to follow them from birth means that their data is really, really powerful.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study arrives as providers in the United States contend with twin realities: ADHD medication prescriptions are &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.0054?guestAccessKey=33abeac9-4ad8-4e29-a5dd-a7426f6275a3&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=031925%5C" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;skyrocketing&lt;/a&gt; — largely thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/prescribing-adhd-medications-via-telehealth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;telehealth&lt;/a&gt; and diminishing stigma — while &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/health-news-dei-nih-who-children-with-adhd-adderall-rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-morning-rounds/#:~:text=2022%2C%20the%20FDA%20announced%20a,for%20a%20drug%20called%20Focalin."&gt;medication shortages&lt;/a&gt; are imperiling people’s access to these critical treatments. Scientists are also learning more about how the condition interacts with other variables, such as how &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/adhd-symptoms-can-fluctuate-with-the-menstrual-cycle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;menstrual periods&lt;/a&gt; can affect symptoms and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Of those students, at least 42 were not fully vaccinated against measles, according to the district. The lack of immunization sparked concern with city officials, especially due to recent outbreaks of the disease in other parts of the country,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; like Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;700 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; have been reported and &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/06/nation/second-child-dies-measles-texas/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;two children have died&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nolin and Newton Health and Human Services did not immediately return requests for comment about the stricter policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To comply with the state requirements, Newton Health and Human Services and school nurses will provide vaccines for students, the district said. There are two exemptions for immunizations: religious exemptions and doctor-approved exemptions for immunocompromised students. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve got to follow state law, that’s our responsibility,” said School Committee Chair Chris Brezski, who has two middle schoolers in the system. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Massachusetts recently reported one case of measles from a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/14/metro/contagious-measles-visits-boston/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Boston tourist&lt;/a&gt;. Measles is one of the most highly contagious diseases, able to stay in the air for two hours. Newton’s quarantine period for unvaccinated students that come into contact with the disease is 21 days. The district is also not required to make up any missed education during that time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the herd immunity threshold for measles is between 92 percent and 94 percent immunization rate.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Massachusetts is currently &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/Vaccine/index.html?_gl=1*41phfd*_ga*MTAwOTE0OTEyMC4xNzUwODYxODg0*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTA4NjE4ODQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTA4NjE4ODQkajYwJGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*ODgyOTMzODk5LjE3NTA4NjE4ODQ.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTA4NjE4ODQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NTA4NjE4ODQkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;above average&lt;/a&gt;, at nearly 95 percent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Newton mother Brenda Anders Pring, 53, is a representative of the Massachusetts Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Although immunization is widespread in the state, it’s important to keep an eye out for any potential risks to students, said Anders Pring, whose children are in middle and high school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The measles vaccine works really well if most people are vaccinated,” Pring said. “We’re at a place where we had almost eliminated measles and we hadn’t had a death in over 25 years in the country&lt;b&gt;."&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other parents and teachers agreed with the district’s efforts to comply with state requirements. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Denise Cremlin, a Spanish high school teacher at Newton North, said she was glad the school is taking action to protect students who might be undergoing chemotherapy treatments or have medical conditions that prevent them from getting vaccinated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s not just about me being vaccinated, it’s about how do I keep the other people in my community safe, who might be at more risk than I am,” Cremlin said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jonathan Brenner, 59, a pediatrician and parent of a fourth grader and, said he was surprised it took so long for the district to notify families about the unvaccinated students, and didn’t know exemptions during the pandemic period that allowed students to matriculate without all vaccine requirements hadn’t been updated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When you have a pocket of unimmunized children, these infectious diseases can spread,” Brenner said. “So I’m fully in support of the reinstatement of these vaccine requirements, and I’m also fully in support of the district’s position that they will not allow students back at school in the fall unless they admit the vaccine requirements.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Jessica Weed, 45, has a second grade student in the system. Weed is a stay-at-home mom who wasn’t aware of any chicken pox outbreaks, but agreed with the vaccine reinforcement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Especially for measles, I guess COVID or flu is more of a choice, but measles for sure,” Weed said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Researchers have now shown that, despite individual differences in neuron activity, a shared underlying structure guides the brain toward unified decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By training macaques in a color-choice task and recording neural activity, scientists discovered that neuron responses are shaped by a common “potential landscape” that varies with task difficulty. This study offers a new model for how the brain organizes complex decisions and may inform future understanding of psychiatric conditions that disrupt decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Diverse neurons follow a common potential landscape that shapes their collective decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty Modulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Easier decisions show steeper neural “slopes,” promoting quick choices; harder ones flatten the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Understanding this coordination may shed light on disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Princeton University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every decision begins invisibly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before someone acts, the brain is already hard at work gathering evidence, weighing options, and gradually committing to a choice. But even when faced with the same evidence, people can arrive at different outcomes, especially when the decision is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two different drivers in rush hour traffic, for example, see the same congested road, yet one might speed up to merge while another cautiously brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the brain, made up of billions of specialized cells, makes these split-second decisions has largely been a mystery, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new findings from Princeton University, in collaboration with researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Stanford University, and Boston University, shed light on how diverse brain cells come together to guide a unified decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that while individual neurons have perplexingly complex responses, their activity is shaped by a shared structure that ultimately guides the brain toward a unified choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on June 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic experiments in neuroscience have shown that the brain maps simple sensory information, like basic shapes or sounds, in predictable ways. A black rectangle rotated at a 45-degree angle will activate a specific group of cells in the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the angle slightly, though, and a different group lights up. But decisions, especially when tied to action, are more complicated than distinguishing slightly different tones or shapes, making it difficult for researchers to identify the neural code that guides decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this challenge, the research team trained rhesus macaques to determine which color (red or green) was more dominant on a checkered screen. Easy trials were clear-cut, but ambiguous ones required careful deliberation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the monkeys considered their choice, researchers recorded activity from nerve cells in the dorsal premotor cortex, a brain region involved in translating decisions into actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that neurons responded very differently, even within the same trial, suggesting a high degree of “heterogeneity” or variability, in the neural code for decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widespread assumption is that this heterogeneity reflects the complex dynamics involved in cognition,” said Tatiana Engel, Ph.D., associate professor at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But surprisingly, we found that this apparent complexity arises from a very different neural coding principle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain this diversity, the team developed a flexible computational model that revealed two critical features driving each neuron’s behavior: 1) tuning: when and to what kind of decision a neuron tends to respond; and 2) neural dynamics: represented by a “potential landscape” that guides activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this model, valleys in the landscape represent stable decision that’s been made. As neural activity unfolds, it’s like a ball rolling across the terrain: steeper slopes push activity more decisively toward a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fitted to real data, the model showed that tuning remained consistent across easy and hard trials, but the shape of the potential landscape changed. In easier tasks, the landscape was steep, leading to quicker, more confident decisions. In harder tasks, the terrain was flatter and more susceptible to noise, increasing the chances of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though each neuron had a different individual response, they all appeared to share the same underlying potential landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of it like a group of skiers descending a mountain,” Engel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each prefers a slightly different path, but all are shaped by the same slope beneath them. Similarly, each neuron has its own preference and activity, but the group of cells collectively in the premotor cortex takes a coordinated journey and gradually settles into a stable state that represents the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how neurons collaborate to make decisions could offer deeper insight into fundamental brain function, and how it goes awry in disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, where decision-making processes are altered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a new model in hand, Engel and her colleagues now plan to explore how different types of neurons, and the ways they connect, contribute to the diverse tuning and distinct phases of decision-making they observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every decision is unique,” Engel said. “But by digging down to the level of single trials and single neurons, we can start to make sense of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this decision-making and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2541531411141d6555574c4b4640514a4b0b404150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Daniel Vahaba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://princeton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Princeton University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Daniel Vahaba – Princeton University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09199-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The dynamics and geometry of choice in the premotor cortex&lt;/a&gt;” by Tatiana Engel et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dynamics and geometry of choice in the premotor cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain represents sensory variables in the coordinated activity of neural populations, in which tuning curves of single neurons define the geometry of the population code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the same coding principle holds for dynamic cognitive variables remains unknown because internal cognitive processes unfold with a unique time course on single trials observed only in the irregular spiking of heterogeneous neural populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 20:59:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE01QlJoR0ZuQmdSUG00Ym91VloxYkV3U0pNaHVNMmxIeXk1TmRSVTMzcTFRaFRYYXo3Rk9aYjU3Q3lONjBhcm1tcGNHXzJ6dUJMTXhzT2tQeDl0NTZvaGN1V0pFT0pjRnM5TF9IUVREZ3VpTzEtYmVBWXpTMA</guid></item><item><title>握力揭示早期精神病背后的大脑线索-神经科学新闻 | Grip Strength Reveals Brain Clues Behind Early Psychosis - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE91RTVGOXdkRC1CRnRpX3pNRmNfaXpuV3V4d185aEVxMWhGdlpNU0tiU1ducnBkYzZ4UVRINHBJT2RHS3lSZDB4ZGtaa0kzWDNDLVlFRGRBYzh5bzQ1YkthTllYVGdaRzd4WGhZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Psychosis may start not with hallucinations, but with subtle motor changes like reduced grip strength. A new study reveals that lower grip strength in people with early psychosis is linked to altered brain connectivity, particularly in networks that govern both movement and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes affect regions like the anterior cingulate cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and cerebellum, offering a more accessible way to detect and understand psychosis. The findings open the door to new interventions, from brain stimulation to physical training, that may strengthen these neural pathways and improve mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Clues:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor grip strength in early psychosis links to reduced brain connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Targets:&lt;/strong&gt; Disrupted communication in the default mode network may underlie both movement and mental symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Interventions:&lt;/strong&gt; Treatments like TMS or motor training could boost brain function and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Indiana University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychosis often begins not with characteristic disturbances of the mind – delusions like paranoia or hallucinations – but with disturbances in the way we move our body. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For researchers like Indiana University Assistant Professor Alexandra Moussa-Tooks in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, these motor disturbances offer critical insights into the condition of psychosis itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111186"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a hand gripping a ball." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/grip-psychosis-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The analysis confirmed that participants with early psychosis had lower grip strength and well-being scores than healthy controls. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published on June 25 in the&lt;em&gt; American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, senior-author Moussa-Tooks and first-author Heather Burrell Ward, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, explore one such motor ability – grip strength – to uncover the mechanisms linking motor disturbances to psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Moussa-Tooks explains: “Poor grip strength has been associated with many negative outcomes in a variety of people: lower well-being, higher risk of mortality, poor day-to-day functioning, poor quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Grip strength seems to capture that things are not going well. But it hasn’t been well studied in relation to brain function or early psychosis. Our study looks at how grip strength may be an important sign of brain and psychological health in early psychosis.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to suggest that grip strength and overall well-being share common patterns of brain connectivity. It shows that impairment in grip strength and well-being may reflect alterations in what researchers call “resting-state functional connectivity,” a measure of brain network function that may be key to understanding psychosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a novel neuroimaging analysis, Moussa-Tooks and her collaborators demonstrate that brain networks with important roles in both motor and cognitive function play key roles in gripping ability and mental well-being. Their findings lay the groundwork for interventions aimed at improving functioning and wellness in early psychosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A unifying brain circuit explanation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s data came from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis, a large initiative conducted from 2016 to 2020 across multiple sites, among them the IU School of Medicine. It included 89 individuals in the first five years of psychotic illness and 51 healthy controls for whom age- or medication-related motor decline could be ruled out.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis confirmed that participants with early psychosis had lower grip strength and well-being scores than healthy controls. These metrics related to three key brain regions —the anterior cingulate cortex, sensorimotor cortex, and cerebellum— each of which were shown to be connected to the default mode network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher grip strength and greater well-being correlated with greater connectivity between these regions and the default mode network.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying brain targets for new treatments  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are particularly exciting because they identify potential brain targets for new treatments for psychosis,” Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, both researchers see enormous potential in transcranial magnetic stimulation. If in psychosis there is poor communication within the default mode network, TMS is a non-invasive tool that can be used to directly increase that connectivity. Motor training, like exercise, to strengthen brain networks indirectly can offer another promising strategy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Grip strength and other motor functions,” Moussa-Tooks explains, “are easily assessed and more readily interpretable than complex tasks often used to study psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work is showing that these seemingly simple metrics can help us understanding disturbances not only in the motor system, but across complex brain systems that give rise to the complex symptoms we see in psychosis.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the following analogy, she suggests: “If psychosis is a house on fire, symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations are the smoke. In a fire you don’t target the smoke, you target the fire and its source. And yet, currently that’s not how we approach treatment for psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Motor disturbances help us get closer to identifying where the fire may have started and spread. They are more fundamental in the sense that they’re easier to link to different disturbances in the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new study researchers are getting closer to the fire. By drawing a line between motor function and mental health – from grip strength and well-being to patterns of brain connectivity with a key role in psychosis – they are mapping out new paths for understanding and treating an elusive disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#04766b7760616d7067446d712a616071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liz Rosdeitcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://iu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liz Rosdeitcher – Indiana University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.20240780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Grip Strength as a Marker of Resting-State Network Integrity and Well-Being in Early Psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexandra Moussa-Tooks et al. &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grip Strength as a Marker of Resting-State Network Integrity and Well-Being in Early Psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychomotor function is a critical marker of risk and outcome of psychosis. Grip strength is one aspect of psychomotor function that is known to be linked to structural neural integrity and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study sought to determine whether grip strength is a marker of alterations in resting-state connectivity and well-being in psychotic disorders in order to further clarify the mechanisms by which psychosis phenomenology is related to psychomotor processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors analyzed resting-state functional MRI and grip strength in 89 individuals with early psychosis and 51 control subjects without psychiatric disorders from the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis. Participants ranged in age from 16 to 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multivariate pattern analysis of whole-connectome data, the authors identified brain correlates of grip strength and then replicated this analysis using the NIH Toolbox well-being measures and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychosis group exhibited reduced grip strength, well-being, and GAF scores compared to the control group. Grip strength was linked to resting-state connectivity in the sensorimotor cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. Connectivity correlated with the default mode network (DMN) (r&lt;sub&gt;sensorimotor&lt;/sub&gt;=0.22, r&lt;sub&gt;cingulate&lt;/sub&gt;=0.30, r&lt;sub&gt;cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;=0.24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the analysis was repeated for GAF and well-being, overlapping regions in the sensorimotor cortex and cerebellum were connected to the DMN and related to GAF (r&lt;sub&gt;sensorimotor&lt;/sub&gt;=0.17, r&lt;sub&gt;cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;=0.28) and well-being (r&lt;sub&gt;sensorimotor&lt;/sub&gt;=0.16, r&lt;sub&gt;cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;=0.16). Relationships were driven by the psychosis group for cerebellum and cingulate nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data-driven, connectome-wide analysis identified shared brain correlates of grip strength, overall function, and well-being in a sample of young adults with psychosis and healthy control subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that grip strength may be a marker of DMN connectivity, which may in turn be an important marker of overall health, even in young adult populations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 20:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE91RTVGOXdkRC1CRnRpX3pNRmNfaXpuV3V4d185aEVxMWhGdlpNU0tiU1ducnBkYzZ4UVRINHBJT2RHS3lSZDB4ZGtaa0kzWDNDLVlFRGRBYzh5bzQ1YkthTllYVGdaRzd4WGhZ</guid></item><item><title>FDA要求更新有关COVID疫苗罕见心脏病风险的警告-美联社新闻 | FDA requires updated warning about rare heart risk with COVID shots - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPdVFWMjJLTElqbkpWLWxVRDdEN0RxekFsU1BuMkVCZHhkWUJXRXJmYmZWbGxsTE4tREgybk0yeTFNZ00wNUJUbUtELWRzVFdlMEg4eTlxamNaNXJ1ZHlWQXF5elpnaTZwVkQxNWVNZ1VKSHF6eWdNRkNaNkptdlp2NkluNk95cEhITXVKSDdiblJZZ0dsQWdSOGxyYmhSQUZRcEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 20:29:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPdVFWMjJLTElqbkpWLWxVRDdEN0RxekFsU1BuMkVCZHhkWUJXRXJmYmZWbGxsTE4tREgybk0yeTFNZ00wNUJUbUtELWRzVFdlMEg4eTlxamNaNXJ1ZHlWQXF5elpnaTZwVkQxNWVNZ1VKSHF6eWdNRkNaNkptdlp2NkluNk95cEhITXVKSDdiblJZZ0dsQWdSOGxyYmhSQUZRcEE</guid></item><item><title>FDA要求更新有关COVID疫苗罕见心脏病风险的警告-雅虎 | FDA requires updated warning about rare heart risk with COVID shots - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxOejVGWjQwekQ0bVlLYnpOZndCTjF4OTM1OHJjaVhMazhna3dvakMyMG5ERktkb1V1UF94cjM0RHdya1ROYTREQ2g3RmtNQkp4RVdhNDlVOHJuaVEtYVFBY1g0aXRHaTBZd3g5WGJpVXl3dEo1Tm9yTmdOSEZWazZnZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-food-and-drug-administration" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Food and Drug Administration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Myocarditis, a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-552859079506" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type of heart inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;type of heart inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Specifically, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/187265/download?attachment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new warning;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;new warning&lt;/a&gt; lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The FDA’s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/susan-monarez-cdc-director-senate-hearing-rfk-c7c883f604711238643a9ffd1681bcc0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The FDA announcement came as &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccine-advisers-covid19-rsv-a85baa8a9296fd857af5ce33ae3b6cfd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new vaccine advisers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;new vaccine advisers&lt;/a&gt; appointed by Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/people/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" data-ylk="slk:Robert F.

The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Conflict is another factor. The outbreak of civil war in Sudan in 2023 led to one key coverage measurement — the number of children receiving the first dose of the DTP vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis — falling from almost 90 percent to about half of that, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJ3JMTH5QRBQ7JC4R7W7RWWB2Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Planned budget cuts to vaccines “are likely to disproportionately affect low-income and middle income countries,” the study said, but richer countries are also likely to be affected by higher costs caused by increasing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EAW4OI45IJFUVG7N3Z56MDN5DM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study’s findings echo a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2025-increases-in-vaccine-preventable-disease-outbreaks-threaten-years-of-progress--warn-who--unicef--gavi" target="_blank"&gt;warning this spring&lt;/a&gt; from the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who noted outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases were increasing around the world, “putting lives at risk and exposing countries to increased costs in treating diseases and responding to outbreaks.” He urged countries with limited resources to “invest in the highest-impact interventions — and that includes vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MEZQPBZHCZBPNMN4GTUSXQUVHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study, which was funded by the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, was published in the Lancet medical journal.

&lt;p&gt;Experts are warning medical professionals and those who venture outdoors to be aware of a tick-borne illness that is moving south into Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study published in April in the Journal of Medical Entomology indicates that cases of babesiosis, a parasitic disease, are on the rise in parts of Virginia thanks to the southward migration of its host, a northern variant of the blacklegged tick, also known as the deer tick. A few hotspots in Virginia — notably Northern Virginia, Southwest Virginia and the Eastern Shore — have seen a spike in babesiosis, although the number of cases is dwarfed by the better known and more common Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, more than 1,500 Virginians contracted Lyme disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The same year, there were seven reported cases of babesiosis, according to the Virginia Department of Health. But babesiosis poses unique risks and appears to be on the rise, prompting public health officials to raise awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses that are caused by a bacterium or virus, babesiosis (pronounced buh-BEE-zee-oh-sis) is caused by a protozoan. People can become infected with babesiosis through a bite from a tick carrying the microorganism. Blacklegged ticks are most likely to bite humans, although another species, the hard tick, which is also found in Virginia, can spread babesiosis among animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-9c2tt1oP" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_9c2tt1oP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Babesiosis can cause flu-like symptoms and can be fatal for the immunocompromised and other vulnerable populations. Many people who contract the illness may encounter few or no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

Courtesy of Graham Snodgrass&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists and public health officials want to spread awareness about babesiosis because the illness appears to be relatively new to Virginia, and residents may be unaware of its presence. In areas without a long history with the illness, such as Virginia, “clinicians might not be familiar with babesiosis, which can complicate diagnosis and delay treatment,” according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first documented reports of babesiosis in the United States were in 1969 in Massachusetts. Since then, the northern blacklegged tick has been creeping southward. Researchers conducting the babesiosis study found infected ticks in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. The study also identified confirmed cases of babesiosis in those states, along with Washington, D.C., and West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holly Gaff, professor and chair of the biological sciences department at Old Dominion University and a co-author of the study, said that scientists are not sure precisely what is causing the spreading range of the northern blacklegged tick, but it could be caused by a change in agricultural practices and settlement patterns that favor ticks’ hosts. Reforested acreage and suburban expanses have taken over onetime farms.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;figure id="attachment_7885538" class="wp-caption alignright size-article_inline_third"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2024-holly-gaff-1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Holly Gaff" data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2024-holly-gaff-1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="7885538" data-srcset="https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2024-holly-gaff-1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2024-holly-gaff-1.jpg?fit=210%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 210w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Holly Gaff&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are great places for deer, and deer are great food for ticks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaff, who leads ODU’s Tick Research Team, headed a group involved in the study that collected ticks at 18 sites in eastern Virginia. Out of more than 1,200 ticks they collected, eight were found to be infected with babesiosis. Six of the ticks came from Northampton County on the Eastern Shore and one each came from Chesapeake and Portsmouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eastern Shore led the state in the number of reported cases, with seven of 30 cases between 2009 and 2023 coming from Virginia’s stretch of the Delmarva Peninsula, and an additional four in Maryland’s portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a case was reported in the Three Rivers Health District, which includes the counties of the Middle Peninsula and Northern Neck. There have been no reported cases of babesiosis in the Williamsburg area, including James City and York counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua Bernick, an epidemiologist with the Virginia Department of Health and a co-author of the study, said it appears that the tick prefers to inhabit places in Virginia that are more temperate than other areas of the state, such as more northerly counties, places at higher elevations and breezier locations such as the Eastern Shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Bernick and other experts caution that everyone should be vigilant because babesiosis could appear anywhere in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What really caught our attention was the spike in 2023 to seven cases,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of those cases were on the Eastern Shore, three were in Northern Virginia and one was in Central Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the strong military presence in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C., the Department of Defense has committed to combatting tick-borne illnesses, including babesiosis. When military personnel, contractors, their spouses or children contract a disease such as babesiosis, that “takes away from the readiness of military communities,” said Robyn Nadolny, chief of the vector-borne disease branch at Defense Centers for Public Health’s vector-borne disease laboratory in Aberdeen, Maryland, and a co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Robyn Nadolny, left, and Holly Gaff, seen here in the field studying ticks, were co-authors on a study indicating that cases of babesiosis, a parasitic disease, are on the rise in parts of Virginia.

Courtesy of Holly Gaff&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes awareness so important, according to Nadolny, is that ticks can carry more than one pathogen. “We see ticks that are coinfected. One tick bite can result in Lyme and babesiosis,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the emergence of babesiosis in Virginia and Maryland is not a reason to avoid outdoor pursuits altogether, Nadolny said. “It’s good for you to go outside. It’s good for you to go on a walk,” she said. “All of that is absolutely still on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, during high tick season, people should be vigilant, conducting tick checks anytime they’ve been places ticks tend to live such as forests, fields and other natural habitats. Checking one’s own body after being outside is important, and so is helping children, who tend to have poor body awareness, Nadolny said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernick, of the VDH, said that the best way to mitigate potential tick-borne disease is through bite prevention. Insect repellents that contain at least 20% Deet or picaridin can be used on the skin, and products containing permethrin can be used to treat clothing. In prime tick habitats, people should wear long pants, tuck their shirt into their pants and their pants into their socks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final component of babesiosis awareness is making sure that it’s known among medical professionals and the people they treat. “If you get sick, make sure you talk to your doctor knowing this is a possibility,” Gaff said.&lt;/p&gt;

Individuals with higher anxiety are thought to have difficulty disengaging attention from threatening stimuli, potentially fueling hypervigilance and a sense that danger is always present. Many cognitive models and therapies, including attentional bias modification, assume that this delayed disengagement is involuntary and resistant to motivational control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agnes Musikoyo and colleagues examined whether delayed disengagement from threat-related stimuli is truly an involuntary feature of anxiety or whether it might reflect voluntary attentional choices. Prior studies have often confounded initial orienting with disengagement and rarely considered the role of motivation in disengagement. The authors designed three pre-registered experiments using central fixation paradigms that isolate the disengagement process and manipulated participants’ motivation to disengage using punishment or reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 1 included 142 undergraduate participants who were assigned to low or high anxiety groups based on their DASS-21 scores (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales). After a Pavlovian conditioning phase where participants learned to associate one colored circle with an aversive noise (CS+) and another with no noise (CS–), they completed an eye-tracking task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants had to saccade to a peripheral target while a CS+ or CS– stimulus appeared at fixation. Disengagement was penalized with a noise if too slow, incentivizing quick responses. Key measures included saccade latency from the central stimulus and self-reported anxiety, aversiveness ratings, and noise expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiments 2 and 3, larger samples of participants (201 and 195 respectively) completed remote reaction-time tasks. Participants saw centrally presented images (angry/fearful/neutral faces in Experiment 2; angry/happy/neutral faces and snakes/spiders in Experiment 3) followed by a visual search task. Motivation was manipulated: half the participants received monetary incentives for quick responses, while the rest received only correctness feedback. Anxiety was measured using the DASS-21 (Experiment 2) and STAI-T (State Trait Anxiety Inventory; Experiment 3), and disengagement was inferred from slower response times when threat stimuli were shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1, participants were consistently slower to move their eyes away from the CS+ stimulus compared to the CS–, even though such delay increased their chance of being punished with the aversive noise. This suggests that motivationally salient threat signals can involuntarily capture attention. However, this effect was not influenced by participants’ anxiety level. High- and low-anxiety individuals showed comparable disengagement latencies. Even when analyzed using more sensitive trial-level models and including all participants, there was no evidence that anxiety predicted greater difficulty in disengaging from threat under high-motivation conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 2, the researchers found no evidence that emotional facial expressions, whether angry or fearful, slowed participants’ disengagement from the central stimulus, regardless of anxiety level or motivational context. While participants who were motivated by rewards responded faster overall, their disengagement speed did not differ depending on the emotional content of the face. Moreover, anxious individuals did not show any greater tendency to dwell on negative faces. The results were consistent across multiple analytic strategies, and again, no anxiety-related attentional bias emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 3, participants did exhibit slower responses when disengaging from images of snakes and spiders, suggesting these stimuli were indeed more attentionally captivating. However, this pattern did not interact with anxiety level or motivational condition, and no consistent effects emerged for emotional faces, even when participants had time to process them before the search task began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the findings across the three experiments suggest that attentional disengagement from threat is not inherently impaired in anxious individuals. Instead, the tendency to dwell on threat-related stimuli may be more situational and influenced by task demands and stimulus properties, rather than being a stable, anxiety-driven deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of note is that the threat stimuli used may not have been equally motivationally relevant across participants, particularly the use of emotional faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2025.2514625"&gt;The role of motivation in delayed disengagement from threat in anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Agnes Musikoyo, Andrew E.

However, a new study in middle-aged and older adults suggests that daytime napping, particularly around the middle of the day, is linked to a higher risk of death from any cause.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was presented at &lt;a href="https://www.sleepmeeting.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Sleep 2025&lt;/a&gt; — the 39th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies (APSS), held in Seattle, WA, between June 8–11 — cannot prove a causative link but suggests that further research is needed into links between daytime napping and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An abstract of the study is available in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/Supplement_1/A152/8135607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the Sleep Research Society, though its full results are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://recognitionhealth.com/team-member/dr-emer-macsweeney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Emer MacSweeney&lt;/a&gt;, MD, CEO and consultant neuroradiologist at Re:Cognition Health, who was not involved in this study, told &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are significant because they suggest that daytime napping patterns could serve as early markers of declining health or disrupted sleep architecture in older adults. While previous research has focused on nighttime sleep duration and quality, this study expands the scope by identifying the timing, length and variability of naps as potential indicators of all-cause mortality risk. […] the findings underscore the importance of viewing sleep as a 24-hour cycle, where daytime behaviours are just as telling as those during the night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data from 86,565 participants in the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. At the start, participants had a mean age of 63 years, 57% were female, and none had a history of shift work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants completed 7 days of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7191872/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;actigraphy&lt;/a&gt; monitoring — continuous wearing of a wristwatch-like device that tracks activity to monitor sleeping and waking times. The researchers used this data to identify frequency, timing and duration of daytime naps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recorded mean nap duration between 9 am and 7 pm, variability in nap duration for each individual across days, and timing of naps within the 2-hour time windows of 9–11 am, 11 am–1 pm, 1–3 pm, 3–5 pm, and 5–7 pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for demographics, body mass index (&lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Heart Lung and Blood Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/calculate-your-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;), smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, nighttime sleep duration, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8063933/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;chronotype&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers assessed associations between napping patterns and all-cause mortality during the 8-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Median nap duration for all participants was 0.40 hours, with a variation in nap length of 0.39 hours for each individual. People took the most naps between 9 and 11 am (34%), with 10% between 11 and 1, 14% between 1 and 3 pm, 19% between 3 and 5 pm, and 22% between 5 and 7 pm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 8-year follow-up, 2,950 participants died (3.4% of the total). For those who died, mean survival from the start was 4.19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers found that those who died during follow up took longer naps, had more variation in their nap times, and were more likely to nap between 11 am and 3 pm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacSweeney commented that: “This study is a reminder that napping is not inherently negative, but changes in napping behaviour, particularly longer and irregular naps, can signal evolving health concerns. It reinforces the need for clinicians to ask about daytime sleep as part of a routine assessment, especially in older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also opens the door to further research into the neurobiological and physiological changes that may link daytime sleep patterns to mortality, particularly in relation to early-stage dementia, inflammation, or metabolic instability,” she told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.23765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; has suggested that short daytime naps may be beneficial to health, potentially lowering systolic blood pressure, but long daytime naps are associated with higher BMI, waist circumference, blood glucose and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/is-excessive-sleepiness-as-we-age-a-warning-sign-of-dementia" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that excessive daytime napping is linked to a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these, as well as the latest study, are observational, so cannot show a causative link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kanwarkelleymd.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Kanwar Kelley&lt;/a&gt;, MD, JD, triple-board-certified in Otolaryngology Head &amp;amp; Neck Surgery (ENT), Obesity Medicine, and Lifestyle Medicine, and co-founder and CEO of Side Health, who was not involved in the current research, agreed that the study cannot establish causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelley explained why there might be an association between daytime naps and higher mortality:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may be because individuals with higher comorbid conditions are more likely to experience lower energy levels during the day or require naps. Alternatively, naps may be more frequently needed for those who are not getting enough sleep at night, which can lead to an increase in co-morbid conditions. Further research will be necessary to identify stronger associations between sleep and mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacSweeney agreed, noting that, “[g]iven the observational design of the study, it is more plausible that excessive or irregular napping is a symptom rather than a cause of underlying health conditions.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“In this context,“ she told us, “excessive napping likely functions as a clinical red flag rather than a direct contributor to mortality.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several measures you can take to try and get a better night’s sleep, so that you are less likely to need those daytime naps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacSweeney recommended the following evidence-based strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;establishing a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;limiting caffeine and alcohol, especially in the evening&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;creating a calming bedtime routine, free from screens and overstimulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;increasing daytime exposure to natural light to strengthen circadian rhythms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;managing medical conditions such as pain, heart failure or respiratory issues that may disrupt sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;treating underlying sleep disorders like sleep apnea or restless legs syndrome&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;exercising regularly, but avoiding vigorous activity close to bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She cautioned that, “[i]f excessive sleepiness persists despite good sleep hygiene, a clinical sleep assessment is recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The new] study is essential to remind medical workers to ask patients and caretakers about individuals’ sleep and their quality of sleep. Establishing good sleep habits may help you maintain healthier, longer sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Kanwar Kelley, MD, JD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 17:22:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNLWVVbm5UWHk0NGdKOFNlamd6dzJ1UHBQcl9xUkJRdDdjLXROdnF4TUNYbFVhRXRPRnZZSFotTW9BWmRDcjlxdl9WNndQQ1I0SVZnME8xY1Nhdm5laUpab1Y1dEY0R0NGTUx6NmxJWGNTLTNJdVBYYnZZb1czbUpLRUFDekp6eEg2LTFDMA</guid></item><item><title>新型冠状病毒变异正在蔓延：报告了痛苦的新症状- AL.com | New COVID variant is spreading: Painful new symptom being reported - AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPV1N1VTJ1VVZZM090WkVQV0lVeWZucDkwb1BwLVpxd3pSeXpWUzdpOXE1MHlpUnBVVHVVX2dKSnA0T2RoTjcxdnNOaTJxeUR0dzZ0am5yVndPaGJFZzFrcFBFTzF3RDRDVUNDUXM4UjdZSU9UWDJsRjlkcWNRYnJtdTVEQ0MxZmN4amo1aTl1WEI2N2R0NUZQUHhYLWlPcXVwNzUtaNIBuAFBVV95cUxQMXJNcGxnUXFqVkpLb1JBSWh6VTB1cVFCT2Q5RWcxR0tYeXlndVVQU1FwS2ZBZHVNTWhZV2dTQV82MXhRZHMwYXE1RG80WVRCdjZnZFpWMWM5YUJZamtyaUNvTDRIZkNVR1NSOWxHOV9uNUZkaXVqdGgxXzktY3V3NEdieHMzM04tb1ZnelpEOFZ2M1JsRndOa3hxNHVDYkRMb28zZ2tKSjBsd0xuQnB6VGRoWVI3T0o2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HWYZQUAGYVESNFRHKYOINAV4K4"&gt;A new COVID variant is spreading quickly in the U.S. and bringing with it a painful new symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UEXORL43ZZBMRPGDWGHXFH5FAI"&gt;Variant NB.1.8.1, or Nimbus, was first detected in China in January and, in May, accounted for 0% if cases in the U.S. in May, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/06/23/new-covid-variant-2025-symptoms/84317260007/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/06/23/new-covid-variant-2025-symptoms/84317260007/"&gt;USA Today reported. &lt;/a&gt;By early June, it made up 37% of cases in the country, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/index.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

reports&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Yet, when she brought her concerns to her general practitioner, the doctor told her she "didn't qualify" to be tested for breast cancer — a condition, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/american-cancer-society-recommendations-for-the-early-detection-of-breast-cancer.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, that is typically screened for in people 40 years or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes' physicians assumed her concerns were due to fibrocystic breast tissue, simple lumps in breasts that aren't linked to disease or cancer and are often associated with the menstrual cycle, per &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibrocystic-breasts/symptoms-causes/syc-20350438" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But three years later — on April 13, 2018 — Hughes saw a "shadow and a dimple" on her breast while putting on a bikini, and promptly called her doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lea Hughes / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Leah Hughes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I explained it to doctors on the phone, they referred me straight to the hospital," Hughes said, per &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, Hughes was given a mammogram, an ultrasound and a biopsy on the lump in her breast. After rounds of testing, physicians confirmed she had breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the diagnosis, she underwent more scans and tests — this time to see if the cancer had spread anywhere else in her body. MRI, PET and bone scans showed that the disease had spread to her bones and her liver, &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Doctors told Hughes her cancer was incurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following years, Hughes was able to manage the cancer through various drug treatments. Four years after she was diagnosed, in 2022, Hughes opted for a single mastectomy followed by chemotherapy, but in August 2024, doctors found the cancer had spread again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumors in her liver had grown, a routine scan showed, and the disease had since spread to her brain — after which she began whole-brain radiotherapy and more chemo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lea Hughes / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Leah Hughes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With stage 4 breast cancer, you know it can spread to the brain and you do worry," Hughes said. "But I didn't expect it then, because I had no symptoms at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Hughes began experiencing respiratory issues, and found the cancer had spread once again, this time to her lungs — which, she learned, required a procedure to remove 4.5 liters of excess fluid that had built up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Hughes is in her sixth round of chemo and fundraising to be able to afford a drug called Enhertu, which is not broadly available for people with her type and stage of breast cancer. She said she's at a stage of acceptance, but is "also not giving in" as she navigates her journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't believe everything I've been through. You don't realize until you sit back and reflect," she said.

Known scientifically as Toxoplasma gondii, this tiny invader silently alters &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-study-restores-brain-function-for-alzheimers-patients/"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt; without obvious symptoms. Beneath this stealth lies a complex interaction with brain cells, highlighting new health risks previously underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly one-third of Americans carry Toxoplasma gondii, often unaware they harbor the parasite. Usually contracted from undercooked meat or contact with cat feces, the infection rarely causes obvious illness in healthy people. However, this parasite can form long-lasting cysts inside brain cells, specifically neurons, quietly disrupting essential brain communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="neurons_and_astrocytes_a_vital_partnership"&gt;Neurons and Astrocytes: A Vital Partnership&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons carry vital information through electrical signals, enabling movements, thoughts, and feelings. These &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/weight-loss-connected-to-nerve-cells-in-the-brain-study-finds/"&gt;nerve cells&lt;/a&gt; depend heavily on support from astrocytes, the most abundant type of supportive brain cells. Astrocytes nourish neurons, maintain brain chemistry, and regulate critical neurotransmitters like glutamate, preventing harmful build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Primary cortical neurons infected with Toxoplasma.

Wilson, uncovers precisely how Toxoplasma gondii infection disrupts this crucial partnership. Wilson's group, reporting in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1012733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLoS Pathogens&lt;/a&gt;, showed the parasite specifically affects neuron-astrocyte communication by altering extracellular vesicles (EVs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles are tiny sacs released by cells, carrying proteins, genetic materials, and chemical signals. Cells use these vesicles to communicate vital messages over short distances. Normally, neurons produce ample EVs that astrocytes receive, regulating neurotransmitters like glutamate. But the researchers discovered infected neurons drastically reduce EV production and alter their contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="altered_messages_parasite_influenced_vesicles"&gt;Altered Messages: Parasite-Influenced Vesicles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team employed sophisticated laboratory techniques, including nanoparticle tracking, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-measure-the-quantum-state-of-electrons-for-the-first-time/"&gt;electron microscopy&lt;/a&gt;, and genetic sequencing, to analyze vesicles from infected neurons. They found infected neuron vesicles contained unusual proteins specific to Toxoplasma gondii, like GRA7 and MAG1, proteins not normally found in human or mouse cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found this disruption in EV signaling can interfere with how neurons and glial cells, especially astrocytes, maintain a healthy brain environment," said Wilson. "Even a handful of infected neurons can shift the brain’s neurochemical balance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the altered vesicles changed astrocyte behavior significantly. Upon receiving these modified EVs, astrocytes increased inflammation-related &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/crispr-helps-scientists-identify-key-genes-in-the-development-of-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;gene activity&lt;/a&gt; and sharply reduced production of GLT-1, the key glutamate transporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_dangerous_neurochemical_shift"&gt;A Dangerous Neurochemical Shift&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Astrocytes typically remove excess glutamate, protecting neurons from overstimulation, which can cause seizures or nerve damage. But when GLT-1 levels fall, excess glutamate accumulates, potentially causing harmful excitability in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of EVs isolated from uninfected and infected neurons.

Wilson’s findings suggest chronic, unnoticed parasite infections may similarly disturb the brain's neurochemical balance, posing hidden health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The parasite may play a larger role in neurological and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/california-launches-two-free-digital-behavioral-health-platforms-for-children-and-families/"&gt;behavioral conditions&lt;/a&gt; than we previously thought," Wilson stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="possible_early_detection_through_vesicles"&gt;Possible Early Detection through Vesicles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, testing for Toxoplasma gondii infection involves detecting antibodies. This method can’t confirm if the parasite still resides actively in brain cells. However, Wilson's discovery opens the door to using EVs as biomarkers, easily isolatable from blood, offering clearer insights into brain infection status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Toxoplasma infection leads to changes in EV protein content.

This advancement could significantly improve how doctors detect and manage chronic brain infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Riverside team now plans to examine &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/a-single-drop-of-blood-provides-comprehensive-health-insights-within-minutes/"&gt;human blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from blood banks for signs of parasite-influenced EVs. Additionally, they aim to understand how glial cells recognize parasite proteins, insights that might eventually lead to therapies or even vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="understanding_and_protecting_the_brain"&gt;Understanding and Protecting the Brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While infection with Toxoplasma gondii rarely leads to severe illness in healthy adults, understanding its subtle impacts is essential. This parasite primarily poses risks during pregnancy, as a new infection can cause birth defects.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching a milestone age like 50 can come with a new set of priorities for the season ahead. For women, your 50s likely mark the tail end of your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-first-in-perimenopause-8776589" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;journey through menopause&lt;/a&gt; (women typically reach menopause by the age of 52).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This physical transition is accompanied by &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-break-for-better-metabolic-health-8751700" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;changes in metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, bone density and muscle mass, which means your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eating-changes-to-make-at-50-11757224" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nutrient needs shift&lt;/a&gt; in this new era of life as well. Your 50s become a prime time to start prioritizing key nutrients like calcium, omega-3s, protein and fiber (if you haven’t already!). Dietitians shared their top foods for women in their 50s to ensure you’re getting enough of these important nutrients in your diet each week.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now that you’ve celebrated 50 years around the sun, your brain health may be more top of mind. Luckily, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting your brain health&lt;/a&gt; may be as simple as snacking on nuts regularly. “Studies have linked regular &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-eating-nuts-can-help-with-weight-loss-11681605" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nut consumption&lt;/a&gt; to better memory and quicker mental processing in older adults.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; She adds that nuts deliver key nutrients for brain health: “Walnuts provide omega-3 fatty acids that support &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy brain structure&lt;/a&gt; and nerve signaling.” Sprinkle walnuts on a salad like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/raspberry-spinach-salad-with-avocado-walnuts-8785979" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Raspberry-Spinach Salad with Avocado &amp;amp; Walnuts&lt;/a&gt; or have them at breakfast in this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blueberry-coconut-walnut-baked-oatmeal-8776719" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Blueberry-Coconut-Walnut Baked Oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One staple that can help you meet many of your nutrient needs is dairy. For starters, it’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938628/high-protein-foods-list-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in protein&lt;/a&gt;—just one glass of milk has 8 grams, while a cup of cottage cheese contains a whopping 24 grams, so it adds up quickly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Protein plays a vital role in preventing muscle and bone density loss, which accelerates during menopause due to the decrease in estrogen levels,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-fencl-rd-cd-35a6251b2/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Lindsay Fencl, RD, CD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “By &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-gaining-muscle-mass-11750809" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; and promoting bone strength, protein helps counteract the natural decline in lean tissue and bone mineral density, which reduces the risk of osteoporosis and frailty with age.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; ​“Dairy products are not only rich in protein but also contain essential nutrients like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-take-vitamin-d-and-calcium-at-the-same-time-8684625" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D and calcium&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are critical for maintaining bone strength and density as you age,” adds Fencl. After menopause, a woman’s daily calcium needs increase from 1,000 milligrams to 1,200 milligrams, so eating dairy more often can help you bridge the gap.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For even more benefits, choose fermented &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dairy products&lt;/a&gt; like yogurt and kefir, which contain probiotics. These helpful gut microbes play an active role in lowering inflammation and reducing the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Berry-Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/golden-milk-shake-8742332" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Golden Milkshake&lt;/a&gt; for your dose of dairy.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/your-diet-may-be-the-reason-for-sleep-issues-8678772" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; plays an integral role in how well you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So take care of your gut and it will return the favor. One food that will show your gut some love is beans. Not only are they a versatile pantry staple, but they’re rich in fiber—a specific type of fiber called prebiotics. “Prebiotic foods have gut-friendly benefits, and I often recommend them to support a healthy gut through aging. They are a type of dietary fiber and act as a ‘primer’ for probiotics,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinga-portik-gumbs-rdn-ldn-b3801319b/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kinga Portik-Gumbs, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because prebiotics provide the necessary fuel for the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;beneficial bacteria in your gut&lt;/a&gt; to thrive.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For women over 50, nutrition plays a vital role in protecting long-term brain health, especially as hormone changes can affect memory, mood and cognitive sharpness,” says Robinson. That’s why consuming the recommended two servings of fatty fish a week should be at the top of your list.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Fatty fish are packed with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; that help reduce inflammation in the body,” says Fencl—that includes inflammation in the brain. Research suggests that consuming adequate amounts of omega-3s can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;preserve brain function&lt;/a&gt; as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (That’s why omega-3s earned our top spot for the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026789/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;most important nutrient for brain health&lt;/a&gt; as you age.)

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3s can also be helpful for those who are still transitioning through menopause. Per Fencl, omega-3s can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-nutrients-for-menopause-8740097" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alleviate menopausal symptoms&lt;/a&gt; (mood swings, sleep disturbances and hot flashes), improve overall health and support healthy body weight by increasing satiety and controlling cravings.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Need some inspo for adding fatty fish to your meal plan? Try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/green-goddess-tuna-salad-8598999" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Green Goddess Tuna Salad&lt;/a&gt; or these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ginger-soy-salmon-bites-8669146" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Ginger-Soy Salmon Bites&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Go meatless for dinner at least once a week and opt for soy foods in place of your usual protein. They’re not only a source of high-quality plant-based protein, but they also provide a host of other nutrients that are needed after turning 50. Soy contains a unique nutrient called phytoestrogens, which act like a weaker form of the hormone estrogen. These phytoestrogens may help manage symptoms of menopause, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878846/food-for-fewer-hot-flashes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hot flashes and night sweats&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Miss Out on Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;“Adequate protein intake helps regulate blood sugar by improving insulin sensitivity, which can be crucial in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-insulin-resistance-8741761" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventing insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and managing the risk of type 2 diabetes, conditions that are more common as hormone levels fluctuate,” says Fencl. Some studies suggest that aiming for 1 to 1.2 grams of protein daily per kilogram of body weight can help prevent muscle loss postmenopause.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Strength Training to Your Workout Routine:&lt;/strong&gt; Protein and strength training work synergistically to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sarcopenia-treatment-11746009" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;preserve muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; during and after menopause. “Protein consumption needs to be paired with consistent &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;,” notes Fencl. “I recommend two to four days per week of heavy strength training that lasts between 30 to 45 minutes and focuses on four to eight reps per set.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; “Sleep is an underrated yet crucial necessity for women in their menopausal stage. A good night’s sleep acts like a phone charger; it recharges our energy and well-being. Some tips to achieve a better sleep are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-women-over-50-should-do-before-bed-11757559" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;creating a nighttime routine&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., journaling, reading, taking a bath) or switching to cooling sleepwear or cooling bedding to reduce night sweats,” says Portik-Gumbs. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A nutrient-rich diet is important at any stage of life, but may be even more so for women in their 50s. During this decade, women face the pivotal transition through menopause to postmenopause. The significant hormone shift that accompanies menopause brings about new health concerns like maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone density&lt;/a&gt; and supporting brain and heart health.

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a really simple, easy way to help folks meet their protein needs,” registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.abbeyskitchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.abbeyskitchen.com/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;Abbey Sharp&lt;/a&gt; tells &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;. She says most Americans aren’t deficient in protein, but “there are so many benefits to getting 25% to 30% of your calories from protein.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include feeling full and satisfied after meals, building muscle mass (which is especially important as you age), supporting weight loss, and your hair, skin, and nail health. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as protein powder becomes a staple in more people’s diets, there is growing chatter that it’s causing stomach issues, as social media users blame the supplement for their &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sophiesappp/video/7488889096719322399?q=protein%20powder%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1750774403281" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@sophiesappp/video/7488889096719322399?q=protein%20powder%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1750774403281" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reinafitpro/video/7477270360355015982?q=protein%20powder%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1750774403281" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.tiktok.com/@reinafitpro/video/7477270360355015982?q=protein%20powder%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1750774403281" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;gas&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what experts think.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How protein powder ingredients affect your gut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are multiple reasons that protein powder could irritate the stomach, according to registered dietitian and professor of nutrition at NYU, &lt;a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/ethan-k-balk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/ethan-k-balk" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;Ethan Balk&lt;/a&gt;. Whey protein in particular could be a likely culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-5fe0af52-13 jcJmBQ impression-element" data-cy="in-stream-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="1"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be because of lactose intolerance,” Balk tells &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;. Whey protein powder comes from dairy, and some may experience bloating and gas because their body has trouble digesting the lactose, Balk says. While &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/company/sharp/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/sharp/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt;Sharp&lt;/a&gt; says a possible solution is switching from whey protein concentrate to whey protein isolate, she cautions that isolate, which contains casein, could still cause bloating and nausea for some. In that case, you may want to try swapping whey protein for a plant-based protein to see if that helps, Balk says. If you’re still having issues, you could forgo protein powder or try supplementing with a probiotic, he adds.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potentially irritating ingredients include fermentable fibers like inulin and carrageenan, gums and thickeners like xanthan gum, and sugar alcohols that can produce gas as a byproduct and trigger stomach discomfort, Sharp says. You could try looking for protein powders without those ingredients and with sweeteners like monk fruit extract instead of sugar alcohols, which Sharp says is easier on the stomach.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t overlook fiber&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An important thing to remember, Sharp says, is to not to&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/too-much-protein-not-enough-fiber/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/well/article/too-much-protein-not-enough-fiber/" class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 iHosVH"&gt; not overdo it&lt;/a&gt; on protein powder to the point it displaces other vital nutrient-packed foods in your diet, which could be another cause of stomach issues.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enough fiber in your diet—from plants like whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables—you’re going to have stomach issues, regardless of the protein powder, Sharp says.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-5fe0af52-13 jcJmBQ impression-element" data-cy="in-stream-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A serving of protein powder a day is absolutely safe for folks to consume, especially when you’re combining that with…other sources of lean protein,” Sharp says. “It’s not that the protein itself is causing the issue, especially when eating plant-based sources of protein. The challenge comes when replacing other gut-supporting nutrients like fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="3"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why protein powder might overwhelm the gut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both Sharp and Balk agree that there’s one pretty substantial reason why protein powders could be causing stomach issues: too much protein, too fast.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can slow gastric emptying,” Balk says, which means the protein will hang out in the stomach a bit longer and cause that unwelcomed discomfort. Additionally, having 25 to 30 grams of protein in just a few minutes in the form of a shake or smoothie can overwhelm the gut and lead to more bloating and gas, Sharp explains.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really easy to down a protein shake in a couple gulps versus how long it takes to eat a steak,” Balk adds. “It’s not so much about avoiding ingredients, it’s about slowing down consumption.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-5fe0af52-13 jcJmBQ impression-element" data-cy="in-stream-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balk advises slowing down when you sip on a protein shake to help lessen the impact it has on your stomach.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not designed for stomach comfort. It’s designed to get a lot of protein in. That sets us up for probable or possible stomach distress,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content-sentinel" data-index="5"&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also might help to break up your protein intake—if you normally have two scoops of favorite protein powder in the morning, Balk recommends having one scoop in the morning and another later in the day so you don’t overwhelm your stomach all at once.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter when you’re ingesting the protein, it’s all going to do its job. It doesn’t need to be in one shot to work,” he says.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-5fe0af52-13 jcJmBQ impression-element" data-cy="in-stream-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more on protein:

But strength training is also increasingly important as you age since it preserves muscle mass, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62704292/exercise-for-bone-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62704292/exercise-for-bone-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bone density" data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;bone density&lt;/a&gt;, and functional strength, says Sarah Pelc Graca, CPT, a certified personal trainer and founder of Strong with Sarah Weight Loss Coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That just scratches the surface, though. Here’s the lowdown on exactly how walking and strength training each impact longevity, and what that means for your routine, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="walking-vs-strength-training-for-brain-health" data-node-id="6" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;Walking Vs.

On the flip side, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64206527/vo2-max-cognitive-decline-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64206527/vo2-max-cognitive-decline-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cognitive decline" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; can lead to accidents, memory loss, and even depression, she says. Fortunately, when it comes to supporting brain health and cognitive function, walking and strength training are both amazing, but in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64434477/4-week-walking-plan-burn-fat-build-muscle-pdf/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64434477/4-week-walking-plan-burn-fat-build-muscle-pdf/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walking" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="9.1.0"&gt;Walking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; increases blood flow to the brain, which boosts oxygen and nutrients to the areas responsible for memory and thinking, but it also helps lower stress and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63575056/how-to-get-good-deep-sleep/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="improve sleep" data-node-id="9.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;improve sleep&lt;/a&gt;, which are two big players in cognitive health,” Pelc Graca says. In fact, aiming for around 10,000 steps a day may even be associated with a lower risk of developing dementia. A 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2795819" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2795819" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="JAMA Neurology" data-node-id="9.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="9.5.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="9.5.0.0"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; monitored almost 80,000 adults ages 40 to 79 over about seven years and monitored how many steps they took each day. It found that walking more was associated with a lower risk of dementia, and the optimal amount of daily steps was just under 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197457223002148" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197457223002148" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stimulates the release of growth factors" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.1.0"&gt;stimulates the release of growth factors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (naturally occurring substances that stimulate cell growth), which supports the formation of new neurons in the brain, Pelc Graca says. Lifting weights may also improve executive function and memory, per a 2022 review in &lt;a href="https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00527-7" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-022-00527-7" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Springer Open" data-node-id="11.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.3.0.0"&gt;Springer Open&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 19 studies on the effects of resistance training on cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A combination of walking and resistance training is the ideal recipe for optimal brain health—and this finding is supported by a 2025 review in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1697260025000171" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1697260025000171" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="12.1.0.0"&gt;International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 35 randomized controlled trials to determine the effects that aerobic and resistance training have on cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Walking can be a great gateway to more intense exercise, and may be the best starting place for folks who haven’t been active in a while, but ideally, it’s best to work up to incorporating both types of exercise” for longevity, says exercise physiologist Rachelle A. Reed, PhD, ACSM-EP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="walking-vs-strength-training-for-bone-health" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Walking Vs. Strength Training For Bone Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="body-tip css-18qyn7q emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;Expert verdict: &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strong bones are key to staying active and avoiding serious injuries as you get older, because broken bones—especially in older adults—can lead to long recovery times and even long-term health issues, Pelc Graca says. The good news? Weight-bearing movements like walking and resistance training help maintain and improve bone mineral density, the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue, so you’re less likely to experience fractures and more likely to stay on your feet for the long haul. Strength training has a slight edge at this over walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Walking slows age-related bone loss, especially in the hips and legs, since your bones work to support your body weight with each step, stimulating them to become stronger and denser, Pelc Graca says. As a result, frequent walks may reduce the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63260413/wearing-weighted-vest-for-osteoporosis/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63260413/wearing-weighted-vest-for-osteoporosis/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="osteoporosis" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, per 2024 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11211113/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11211113/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Springer" data-node-id="18.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="18.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="18.3.0.0"&gt;Springer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study monitored 24,000 adults without osteoporosis over three years via questionnaires and found that those who engaged in outdoor walking regularly had a lower risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63025562/full-body-dumbbell-strength-workout/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63025562/full-body-dumbbell-strength-workout/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Strength training" data-node-id="20.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="20.0.0"&gt;Strength training&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; does more than just slow bone loss, though—it also stimulates new bone growth. “Strength training puts controlled stress on bones, signaling the body to build stronger, denser bone tissue,” Pelc Graca says. You can certainly add weight to your body while walking (hello, weighted vest), but there are limitations on the range of motion and weight you can use that actually impact bone preservation and muscle growth, says Natalya Vasquez, CPT, a certified personal trainer, health coach, and founder of On Your Terms Coaching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;However, the different exercises and directions your body moves weights in during resistance training also improves muscle mass, meaning better support for your skeleton, Vasquez says. This is particularly beneficial for older women and those post-menopause, since it helps counteract the bone loss that often occurs during this phase of life, according to a 2022 review in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.1029475/full" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.1029475/full" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Endocrinology" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="21.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="21.1.0.0"&gt;Endocrinology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="21.2"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="walking-vs-strength-training-for-cardiovascular-health" data-node-id="22" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;Walking Vs.

As a result, taking care of your cardiovascular system is nonnegotiable for boosting longevity and fostering a longer, healthier lifespan, Pelc Graca says. Walking shines when it comes to supporting &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64894213/how-to-improve-cardiovasular-health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cardiovascular health" data-node-id="24.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, but strength training still plays a valuable role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10643563/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10643563/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Walking boosts circulation" data-node-id="25.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.0.0"&gt;Walking boosts circulation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lowers blood pressure, supports healthy cholesterol levels, and improves insulin sensitivity, which are all key factors for keeping your heart in tip top shape, Pelc Graca says. Regular exercise like walking also helps manage stress, which can decrease blood pressure and the risk for heart attack and stroke, per the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Heart Association" data-node-id="25.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.2.0"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, because walking is low-impact, accessible, and doesn’t require equipment, it’s easier to do regularly, which is critical for long-term heart health, says Reed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That said, strength training still plays a valuable role in cardiovascular health since it &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64442140/intermittent-fasting-exercise-weight-loss-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64442140/intermittent-fasting-exercise-weight-loss-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reduces body fat" data-node-id="27.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="27.1.0"&gt;reduces body fat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, improves insulin sensitivity, and lowers mortality risk, per a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Exercise Sport and Movement" data-vars-ga-product-id="7c0d17ab-9b4b-49ba-89c8-f7b360e66069" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="27.3" data-href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" data-product-url="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-esm/fulltext/2023/01000/the_health_benefits_of_resistance_exercise__beyond.2.aspx" data-affiliate="false" data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="38ea9dc8-e08d-4945-9174-47ec6576f88c" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 e1aq0z090"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="27.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="27.3.0.0"&gt;Exercise Sport and Movement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that reviewed studies examining the long-term benefits of resistance training.

A lack of muscle is also correlated to poor balance and an increased risk of falls, in turn, upping your chances of injury, says Pelc Graca: “Put simply, more strength equals more freedom to do the things you love for longer.” Strength training takes the cake for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="building muscle" data-node-id="30.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;building muscle&lt;/a&gt;, but walking still supports muscle maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training is the most effective way to build muscle and maintain muscle mass, which both naturally decline with age, Pelc Graca says. Resistance training provides a heavy load to the muscles, which will stimulate muscle growth (hypertrophy). It also improves neuromuscular coordination, the communication between the brain and the muscles, which enables movement, Reed says. This workout also enhances joint stability, balance, and improves range of motion, allowing you to stay stronger and independent for longer, per a 2023 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9935664/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9935664/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Springer" data-node-id="31.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="31.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="31.1.0.0"&gt;Springer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 55 studies on the benefits of resistance training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Besides strength, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64218684/power-vs-strength-training/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64218684/power-vs-strength-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="training power" data-node-id="33.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;training power&lt;/a&gt; is also imperative for being able to move well for as long as possible. “Unlike muscular strength, which refers to how much force a muscle can exert, muscular power combines force and speed,” says Reed. So, maintaining that power is important to do functional tasks like climbing stairs, catching yourself during a fall, or quickly standing up from a chair. Incorporating power movements like medicine ball throws and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63869209/how-to-do-kettlebell-swings-plus-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a63869209/how-to-do-kettlebell-swings-plus-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kettlebell swings" data-node-id="33.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;kettlebell swings&lt;/a&gt; during strength training days can help maintain that force and speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As for walking, Pelc Graca says regular strolls preserve lower-body strength and endurance, especially in the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a28209151/calf-raises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a28209151/calf-raises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="calves" data-node-id="34.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.1.0"&gt;calves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a19962155/hamstring-exercises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a19962155/hamstring-exercises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hamstrings" data-node-id="34.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.3.0"&gt;hamstrings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64919230/best-glute-workouts-exercises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64919230/best-glute-workouts-exercises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="glutes" data-node-id="34.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.5.0"&gt;glutes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g63829177/standing-ab-core-workouts/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g63829177/standing-ab-core-workouts/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="core" data-node-id="34.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.7.0"&gt;core&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Walking also promotes healthy joints and balance, making it easier to move freely and confidently with age. However, because walking is a singular range of motion exercise (you only move forward and backward), it excludes other major muscle groups from activating, therefore limiting overall muscle gains and strength, Vasquez says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="walking-vs-strength-training-for-overall-longevity" data-node-id="35" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="35.0"&gt;Walking Vs.

However, you can tailor your workout routine to your individual interests and health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For instance, “older adults may benefit more from prioritizing strength training to preserve muscle mass and prevent frailty, while individuals with cardiovascular risk factors often need more aerobic activity like walking,” Reed says. “For those just getting started with exercise, walking is typically a more approachable and confidence-building entry point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re unsure where to start, Vasquez recommends walking for 15 minutes after lunch and dinner everyday and adding three 15-minute &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65099004/strength-training-8-years-younger-study-longevity/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65099004/strength-training-8-years-younger-study-longevity/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="full-body strength training" data-node-id="41.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;full-body strength training&lt;/a&gt; sessions to your schedule throughout the week.

"The same fungus once feared for bringing death may now help save lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt; produces spores that are able to lie dormant for centuries — including inside sealed tombs. When disturbed, the fungus can cause deadly respiratory infections, particularly in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/college-student-discovers-psychedelic-fungus-that-eluded-lsd-inventor" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/college-student-discovers-psychedelic-fungus-that-eluded-lsd-inventor"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;College student discovers psychedelic fungus that eluded LSD inventor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GT3jSuC9UzcakeGRbVSdDH" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GT3jSuC9UzcakeGRbVSdDH slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the scientists examined the unique chemical compounds produced by the fungus and discovered a class of natural compounds called RiPPs (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides). These molecules are difficult to isolate and rarely seen in fungi, but they hold therapeutic promise due to their complex structures and bioactivity. This means they have intricate, unique shapes that can interact with biological systems in powerful ways, such as killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found four novel asperigimycins with an unusual interlocking ring structure," lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xuegaolab.org/team/" target="_blank" data-url="https://xuegaolab.org/team/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Qiuyue Nie&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher in chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, said in the statement. "Two of them had strong anti-leukemia properties even without modification."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance the drugs' effectiveness, the researchers attached lipid molecules similar to those found in royal jelly, the nutrient-rich substance that sustains queen bees. This enabled the drugs to enter cancer cells more efficiently, because lipids help drugs cross cellular membranes, which are made largely of fats themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed how a gene called SLC46A3 acts as a kind of molecular gateway, helping the drug escape cellular compartments and target leukemia cells directly. This discovery could aid in the delivery of other promising but hard-to-administer drugs in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike broad-spectrum chemotherapy agents that can damage healthy cells, asperigimycins appear to specifically disrupt leukemia cell division without affecting healthy tissues. Early tests also suggest the compounds have minimal effects on breast, liver, and lung cancer cells. According to the researchers, this selectivity is important for minimizing unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to asperigimycins, the team believe similar life-saving compounds may be hidden in other fungal species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team are planning to test asperigimycins in animal models, with the eventual goal of launching human clinical trials. And by scanning fungal genomes and exploring more strains of Aspergillus, they hope to unlock new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ancient world is still offering us tools for modern medicine," said Gao. "The tombs were feared for their curses, but they may become a wellspring of cures."&lt;/p&gt;
