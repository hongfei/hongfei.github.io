It is our dream to make this achievement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The advance is the latest in a series of transplants involving pig organs since 2022. Surgeons in the US and China have transplanted pig &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03794-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00879-y" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/24/1246577224/gene-edited-pig-kidney-transplant-nyu" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a thymus gland&lt;/a&gt; into a small number of patients. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/01/pig-heart-transplant-faucette-dies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Several died within months&lt;/a&gt;, although their severe illness at the outset meant it was unclear whether the transplants were a factor. But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/04/pig-kidney-transplant" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;others have made a good recovery and have left hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The latest procedure was carried out in a 50-year-old man diagnosed with brain death after a severe head injury. The patient’s own liver was intact and, in a surgery that took more than 10 hours, the organ taken from a genetically modified Bama miniature pig was plumbed into his blood supply as an additional liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The pig had six genetic modifications aimed at preventing immune rejection. These included deactivating genes that contribute to the production of sugars on the surface of pig cells, which the human immune system attacks, and introducing genes that express human proteins to “humanise” the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;After the transplant, the pig liver showed signs of functioning, including producing bile, which helps break down fats in the digestive system, and porcine albumin, a blood protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There was good evidence of compatibility, which is really exciting,” said Peter Friend, a professor of transplantation at the University of Oxford. “Normally if you put a pig organ in it will be stone dead in a few minutes because you get hyper-acute rejection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team behind the advance, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08799-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;described in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, said it was not clear whether the liver would have been able to fully support the patient, given that he had an existing liver and because the liver was removed after 10 days at the request of his family. “We could not see whether the pig liver could support a patient with severe liver failure,” said Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Even if pig livers only partly replace liver function, they could still be valuable as a “bridging” transplant. Friend said that “elegant surgical plumbing” used by the team meant this could be a relatively straightforward procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“They basically slot the liver into … the main artery that runs from the leg towards the heart,” he said. “That makes it safer and much less prone to complications and something that can be removed as and when it’s not needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Muhammad Mohiuddin, director of the cardiac xenotransplantation programme at the University of Maryland, said: “This is a major leap forward for the field. With a liver, you don’t have to keep it for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“You can use it as a bridge until a human liver is available for transplant or it can be used as a partial support until the liver regenerates. I firmly believe that this can work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNRGhHUUExNUtWdmxPcnhQdmhVQjlTc0dPRVZOWUg5NkF0dXFVdU5zZUFNdUs1aHk4TUZQNjZET0h0M1V0eXE5WkdCc19vV1NST3FGZXU4VGRPcEx2UGtrNUhIUlZHR19xZlNmNU56SlZvV1ZUOUdCS0doV1F4dHhhd2QxMGJUQk5KYzhiX0tRZHpPVG9NcEU1RUh3a3VaR1JHcnJNdmJOWjVTazYzcEN4cTIxQ2tsQTNNT0ww</guid></item><item><title>Health department: Michigan resident who received kidney transplant in Lucas County died of rabies from infected organ - WTOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgJBVV95cUxNeWxJb3JfMlNKcmpvME14VHJMSG1qTW55cWFXckhHNlVFN1VEeE1aaExvRW1EUnFsQlJtTWhEVWI4NUZ5Wmg5NWtkX2Fxd3NoY0w0RUFaWWpVVzgwSXhGekZwMWd3UW91SXNrV24ydFVzMTZueWxDREVnclAySmoxMWY0WHBoMHM5MGJ0a2JqUmk1c25kR3FkNHpBQWJiYng3Wl9xOVAxc25VU0hwcUt5dlN0VUFCQzJGYzY4bGZRMS1WaXhaNHdwOXZMaUpnUXhtWlptc3VFMFdCbDIwNzRSLVU5bk81aVJrSDlzaFpJVnFQeWsxMjdPTk9qYkh6alZSSHJUd1V4SlNaQnBVOFUxSXI5bm9QQmFoSU9fQUt6cUJDMVVXeEc5M3ZVZmVZTlhvSFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;This marks the first human case of rabies in Michigan since 2009. Fewer than 10 people die of the virus in the US each year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUCAS COUNTY, Ohio — A Michigan resident died &lt;a href="/article/news/local/rabid-fox-animal-control-safety-rabies/83-974b18a4-8f71-48ea-9b0f-660711cb5af2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;from rabies&lt;/a&gt; after receiving a transplanted organ in Lucas County earlier this year, according to the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carl Schmidt, a deputy coroner with the Lucas County Coroner's Office, said the recipient, who had undergone a kidney transplant in December, contracted the viral disease through the donated organ.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The diagnosis was confirmed by sending tissue to the CDC," Schmidt said. "The cause of death is rabies and complications."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services worked with the Ohio Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the case, marking the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6014a1.htm#:~:text=In%25202009%252C%2520a%2520Michigan%2520resident,later%252C%2520after%2520symptoms%2520had%2520developed." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6014a1.htm#:~:text=in%25202009%252c%2520a%2520michigan%2520resident,later%252c%2520after%2520symptoms%2520had%2520developed."&gt;first human case of rabies in Michigan since 2009&lt;/a&gt;. The testing was conducted in the CDC’s Rabies Lab.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been no reported human cases of rabies in Ohio since 1970, according to the &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/zoonotic-disease-program/diseases/rabies" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/zoonotic-disease-program/diseases/rabies"&gt;Ohio Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC, along with state health departments, confirmed that no additional individuals are at risk of rabies exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A multi-state public health investigation was conducted to determine the risk of exposure to the recipient and found no risk to the general public," Heather Burnette, spokesperson for the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department, said. "Because the recipient was a Michigan resident, this case will not be classified as an Ohio human rabies case."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kara Steele, a representative from &lt;a href="https://www.lifeconnection.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.lifeconnection.org/"&gt;Life Connection of Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, could not comment on the specific case but explained to WTOL 11 that a donor risk assessment interview is conducted before any organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[It gathers] a potential donor’s comprehensive medical and social history on top of a physical assessment and lab work in order to ensure the safety of organs for transplantation," Steele said. "If an organ procurement organization received word from a transplant center concerning any recipient issues, the organ procurement organization would reach out to additional centers that transplanted other organs from a donor hero to see how their recipients are doing and then report back."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identities of both the recipient and the donor have not been released.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility where the transplant took place has also not been disclosed. However, according to the University of Toledo Medical Center’s &lt;a href="https://news.utoledo.edu/index.php/03_18_2025/utoledo-health-expands-transplant-program-to-include-pancreas" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://news.utoledo.edu/index.php/03_18_2025/utoledo-health-expands-transplant-program-to-include-pancreas"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, it is the only organ transplant center in northwest Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTOL 11 has reached out to UTMC for comment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC urges individuals to&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html"&gt; contact a healthcare provider immediately if they suspect exposure to rabies.&lt;/a&gt; Any mammal can contract rabies, although high-risk animals include bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 10 people in the United States die from rabies each year, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

While there is no cure for autism, there are some therapies like applied behavioral anaylsis (ABA) and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14409159/breakthrough-autistic-boy-symptoms-reversed-cheap-drug.html"&gt;medications thought to improve behaviors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study suggests autism may be over diagnosed due to diagnostic criteria that needs to be re-evaluated (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Danilo Bzdok, a neuroscientist at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital and Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute in Canada, said: 'In the future, large language model technologies may prove instrumental in reconsidering what we call autism today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.025"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed 4,200 observational clinic reports from 1,080 children in Quebec being evaluated for autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers tailored a large language modelling program - a type of AI that processes and understands language - to look through these reports and predict if an autism diagnosis would be given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 1,080 participants, 429 were diagnosed with autism by doctors. Included children were seven years old on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers fed the DSM-5's seven criteria descriptions into the AI model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are: difficulties sharing interests with others or having conversations, difficulties in non-verbal communication like making eye contact, difficulties maintaining relationships with other people, repetitive movements and mimicking, rigid adherence to routines or extreme resistance to change, highly restricted interests, and increased sensitivity to sensory stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using the AI model, the researchers argued patients diagnosed with autism were most likely to exhibit non-social behaviors highlighted in the DSM-5's criteria like repetitive behaviors, echolalia, highly restricted interests, or sensory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts suggested that, given the findings, it may be more efficient to focus on non-social behaviors when evaluating a child for autism rather than social ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic shows the behaviors the AI program found was most often linked to an autism diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also argued for diagnostic criteria to be re-evaluated to make diagnoses more accurate and it less likely for autism to be over diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team noted there were several limitations, including less data on older children who may exhibit different signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study comes as the US faces a surge in autism diagnoses.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-adf9d090-0a5a-11f0-a9b4-1b0d01aff380" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data, one in 36 children in the US have autism - just under 2million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early 2000s, this number was closer to seven in 1,000.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, most with the disorder are diagnosed by age five, though some can be tested as young as two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research published last year in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825472#:~:text=The%20ASD%20diagnosis%20rate%20was,6.3%20per%201000%20in%202022."&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; found between 2011 and 2022, autism diagnoses in children between ages five and eight rose 175 percent, from two per 1,000 people to six per 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the biggest increase was among young adults ages 26 to 34, with a 450 percent jump, which suggests they were delayed in getting a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with environmental exposures, experts have noted the rise of autism is partly due to doctors getting better at detecting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, autism advocacy groups have said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:15:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPU2U4RVRLdlZHMmhQakNWQjdWWkFVME9jT1hXNTF5aF9tQkdHdHVaTnlMZEhid285a1NScGVldlA1bEdzWEJVRTk3VXdZclJKOUtJLUdGQmFiR0tKWFM4V1dmc3NKejdZY1Nwd0ZBbjhEV0N4c2JWSWVyeFJlV1Z3WW9BTG9DZTc1UzByMF94VVFHTkdqR0lVczZwT0xwMXEx0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5fby1ENDdaZ2M3aFR0R0VDLVV1clE5RTNQcDVIQUZ6TXBOMWNXTTVfeGs1TV9xVmUwNDNKZ3Q2LTRkYzRkZGpVTV91V3JZaHFHOFZobDBaT3B4d3NHdmdBcTZqcEJRTmFEaF9lYVgxSmhRSzdHc3NnVkF1eEhTMmhBbmN6LUw2VVl3Vl9XQ21WM1dCcDZPdzBBSjRZOUF4ZFlXclRjVUE</guid></item><item><title>Experimental transplant of gene-edited pig liver into human offers hope for new frontier of research - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQRG9kQ3BwdjVNMklOT096dlVfaTJEV3ZHYTJib0hUTmtQWEpwRDlsd2dqdFMySXNLRVNmUS14LVgxSjE5OTVOUkF5dFh4Zmo3YzM3ZGlqaFY3cmJPdG1XUGJUTklnM0JFMmF4MDVtUklnR3dUd2lCektRbGVIT1kwdUk4b1ZqQzlw0gF_QVVfeXFMTlNNYU5hS3RiV2pwWWdETWFJMWhLak50TTZxVFRpbGR2SE9OM0M4UjZ3b2doS1lVWFJCaTB5Yko0NXZWalMtZC1HbGlQb09LeUtSV0tNTVNFZ25RYjZPWEo3WmVjZE9fWFVuTGVRalhVUDZXdTdIOHoteF9zMWVrUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Doctors in China have become the first to report details about a transplant of a genetically modified pig liver into a human.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000d336m2wgh101h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The liver was transplanted last year into a person who was brain-dead, and it “functioned very well in the human body” for 10 days, the researchers said. The blood flow to the organ was good, and there were no signs of immune rejection or accumulation of inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000e336ma30qywq5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a great achievement,” said Dr. Lin Wang, a co-author of the study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08799-1" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0002336m5ecvmu8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more than 100,000 people on organ transplant waiting lists &lt;a href="https://unos.org/data/#:~:text=Improve.,of%20today%201:00pm%20EDT" target="_blank"&gt;in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;, the demand for human organs far outpaces the supply. Scientists have been exploring alternatives for decades, including using pig organs because of their similarity to human organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p3cgdl00013b6mi3lk7byj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/january/first-successful-external-liver-perfusion-using-a-porcine-liver" target="_blank"&gt;Penn Medicine&lt;/a&gt; did the first successful external liver perfusion using a gene-edited pig liver﻿. Blood in a brain-dead patient circulated through a pig’s liver that was outside the person’s body. In that case, the pig’s liver showed no signs of inflammation in the 72 hours it was tested and the patient’s body remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0003336mx12wlu39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have had some successes transplanting gene-edited pig kidneys and hearts into people, but liver transplants have proven to be more complicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0004336mqdxkfzjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The heart just functions as a heart to pump the blood. The major function of the kidney is to produce the urine. The liver has so many functions,” Wang, a surgeon in the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery at Xijing Hospital in Xi’an, China, said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0005336mqb4c00un@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The liver filters the blood, removing toxins and waste; processes nutrients; detoxifies harmful substances like alcohol and drugs; produces bile to help with digestion; produces proteins that help the blood clot; and plays an important role in regulating blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0006336mro3bdm7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working with the liver “is so difficult,” Wang said. “We all know the function of the liver is so complicated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0007336mybntc21b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Replacing a human organ with a pig’s is complicated, said Dr. Shimul Shah, an expert in xenotransplantation — the transplant of animal organs into humans — and division chief of abdominal transplantation in the Integrated Department of Surgery at Mass General Brigham.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p3kxvt00043b6mqskkncty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The liver is a larger organ with a dual blood supply, meaning it gets blood from two sources: the hepatic artery bringing oxygenated blood and the portal vein that brings nutrient-rich partially deoxygenated blood from the digestive organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0008336m5zktxg1y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve done a much better job in kidney and heart and, even in the near future, in lung,” said Shah, who was not involved with the new report. “Liver is going to take a little bit more time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000q336mf006kn6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of September, more than 9,000 people in the US were waiting for a liver transplant. It is the second biggest need on the transplant list, following only kidneys. &lt;a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000l336m1o5w4ebz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A successful pig liver transplant would be a major advance for people with acute liver failure, even as a temporary bridge while awaiting a human donor organ. By the time most of these patients make it to the hospital, Shah said, their livers are so damaged that a transplant is the only option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p46za3000b3b6mh9h2h01v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You can’t take out someone’s liver and not give them something that is going to function in the meantime,” Shah said. A pig organ may be a good fit in this situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0009336m9ks07xfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The newly documented transplant was conducted in March 2024 in China.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000a336m0saci134@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To make the organ more compatible with the human body, scientists made six gene edits to a liver from a Bama miniature pig.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000b336ml2pqwt0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the surgeons placed the pig organ in the patient, they still kept the human liver in place. Wang said he wasn’t sure whether a pig liver could ever fully replace a human’s, since the volume of material that the pig liver produces may not fulfill what a human body requires.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p3s5zl00083b6mroo737dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Separate from Wednesday’s study, the team in China said it has also conducted a pig-to-human liver transplant that involved removal of the human organ, but details about that procedure have not been released.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000f336mvj6jo1ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the newly published case, the researchers terminated the experiment after 10 days at the request of the family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000g336mwox97g1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wang said the new work builds on what the researchers have learned about xenotransplantation from surgeons in the US who have had some success with transplanting kidneys and hearts. It also builds on their own work with animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000h336m0rrnwccm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2013, Wang and his colleagues were the first in China to successfully transplant a pig liver into a monkey, which survived 14 days. The team said it has also done pig-to-monkey heart, kidney, cornea, skin and bone transplants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000i336mbl3kdlyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wang says the team also recently transplanted a pig kidney into a human, and that patient should be well enough to go home soon. Details of the case have not yet been published.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000j336mjiwravko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shah has been &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/press-release/mgh-performs-second-xenotransplant-of-genetically-edited-pig-kidney-into-living-recipient" target="_blank"&gt;a part of the team&lt;/a&gt; at Mass General Brigham that successfully transplanted a pig kidney into a human who is currently doing well enough to live at home. He believes that the science is not quite there yet for the liver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000k336m6fdla1j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think this will help us understand, how do we advance liver xenotransplantation? Because we need more work like this,” Shah said of the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000n336mit52g2b9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Incremental steps help doctors get a step closer to fulfilling the ultimate goal of being able to offer a transplant to everyone who needs one, said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, chief of surgical transplantation at UT Southwestern Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p2lfng0011336md87f3dkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors have experimented with liver dialysis and medicines to treat people with acute liver failure, said Vagefi, who wasn’t involved with the new research, but “nothing’s really moved the needle yet, aside from transplantation, to really help that population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p2no1m0013336mnxutga87@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This shows it really may help bridge someone,” she said of the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Around 700 people are currently on the waiting list for a transplant, and the average wait is three to four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The announcement follows a slew of recent breakthroughs, including transplanting a pig’s heart into a man and a woman currently living with a pig’s kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The surgery team at Xijing Hospital implanting the genetically modified pig liver into a person as part of a nine-hour procedure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Lin Wang, one of the study’s authors from the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi’an, said: ‘The liver collected from the modified pig functioned very well in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s a great achievement. This surgery was really successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We examined the blood flow in the different vessels and arteries. The flow is very smooth. It functioned very well.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experiment was terminated after 10 days because of requests made by the patient’s family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, published in the journal Nature, suggest modified livers can survive and function in human bodies, but further research on long-term outcomes is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We have the opportunity in the future to solve the problem of a patient with severe liver failure,’ Professor Wang added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is our dream to make this achievement. The pig liver could survive together with the original liver of the human being and maybe it will give it additional support.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also expressed a desire to conduct further research on living, non-brain-dead human beings in the future, but stressed the complications and ‘many rules’ around this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The seven-month-old Bama miniature pig had been genetically modified to reduce the risk of rejection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, a team at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia connected a clinically dead person to a genetically modified pig’s liver located outside their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is the first time, however, a pig liver has been transplanted into a human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rafael Matesanz, founder of the National Transplant Organisation in Spain, said: ‘This is the world’s first case of a transplant of a genetically modified pig liver into a brain-dead human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The ultimate goal of the experiment was not to achieve a standard liver transplant, but to serve as a ‘bridge organ’ in cases of acute liver failure, while awaiting a human organ for a definitive transplant.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iván Fernández Vega, Professor of Pathological Anatomy at the University of Oviedo in Spain, described the procedure as a ‘milestone’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The clinical implications are highly relevant, as optimising this approach could expand the pool of available organs and save lives in liver emergencies,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is the first study to demonstrate that a genetically modified porcine liver can survive and exert basic metabolic functions - albumin and bile production - in the human body.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage liver diseases, but the demand for donor livers far exceeds the supply, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 10 days, the donor liver successfully produced bile and maintained a stable blood flow within the human recipient &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pigs are being considered as an alternative source of organs owing to their compatible physiological functions and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pig for this surgery was provided by Doctor Deng-Ke Pan at Clonorgan Biotechnology Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It contained six genetic modifications – the deactivation of three pig genes and the introduction of three genes for human proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was crucial to help prevent the recipient from rejecting the pig organ – a regular hurdle in animal-to-human transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The transplant follows more than 10 years of research into this process on animals. In 2013, scientists performed the first pig-to-monkey liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies into kidney and heart transplants from pigs to humans have also been successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But whilst those organs have mostly one function, the multi-functionality of the liver was a ‘huge obstacle for us to overcome,’ Professor Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2022, a dying man in the US became the first patient in the world to get a heart transplant from a genetically-modified pig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; In 2022, in a medical first, doctors transplanted a pig heart into a patient in a last-ditch effort to save his life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Left is Dr. Bartley Griffith, who conducted the heart transplant procedure, with David Bennett (right) after the surgery was completed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David Bennett, who was suffering from terminal heart failure, underwent a nine-hour operation at the University of Maryland Medical Centre in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 57-year-old survived for two months following the surgery, with doctors describing him as a ‘brave and noble patient who fought all the way to the end’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in November last year, Towana Looney became the fifth living person to receive a gene-edited pig kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since made history as the longest-living recipient, and says she feels ‘like superwoman’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqq800153b73x88ragc4@published"&gt;My husband and I are expecting our first child this summer. He’s starting to freak out about it a lot. Or more likely: his ability to hide how much he’s freaking out is eroding. He had to be born by an emergency C-section, and his mother didn’t make it. I know he’s been to therapy over the issue, but it seems to have resurged in a big way, and it’s manifesting in him becoming jitteringly overprotective of me. I can’t even drive to the corner store without him insisting he go instead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqqb00163b73a6zcf32d@published"&gt;I cannot stand the thought of months of this, but I also know he’s doing this from a place of deep psychological trauma, and I don’t want to damage him if I tell him to fuck off. I’m trying to coax him back into therapy, but he says, with some unfortunate truth, that it’s not an expense we can easily afford—not with a baby coming. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqqc00193b73h8xyjuzc@published"&gt;You’re totally correct here that there’s a balance you need to strike. On one hand, given his past, your husband’s jitteriness seems well justified. On the other hand, stress isn’t great if you’re pregnant—and you could explain to him that if he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants to protect you and the baby, he needs to chill out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqqc001a3b73r6ohbxl4@published"&gt;If his anxiety really can’t be controlled, and therapy truly isn’t an option, have him talk to his primary care physician. Uncontrolled anxiety is treatable in various ways, and his physician might have ideas or pharmaceutical interventions that could help. And, I’m not saying drugs should be the go-to solution, but I wonder if something like edibles could help him through this period until his anxiety about the birth has subsided. If he has an exercise routine, you could encourage him to lean into that to help manage stress as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqqd001b3b73cptpu8pn@published"&gt;All that said, if his anxiety isn’t causing you any adverse health effects—if this is more “very annoying” than “threatening my sense of wellbeing”— a few months of him being overprotective probably won’t break you. Tell him that you will in fact be driving to the store. If he’s stressing you out, tell him he needs to go take that stress away from you and the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdoe002h3b73dk2x20c8@published"&gt;Recently, we learned we are having a baby. I’m excited to be a father. But a while ago, the mother-to-be and I, “Claudia,” bought a house in need of major renovation work—which I’m doing all of—and we have Claudia’s sister living with us as well.They fight constantly to the point that I rented a house down the street to escape to (this was before the pregnancy). Claudia and I are more like friends than lovers but we’re both in that mid 30s range where it seems like “now or never,” and we’d both prefer “now.” I trust her and myself to be great parents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdof002i3b73uyuvzw8p@published"&gt;I’m wondering how to raise a kid as friends versus as conventional parents. I don’t think it’s crazy—but both of our families do. I’d like the sister to stick around as she’s a great person, but I understand that that’s not likely possible. The mortgage is expensive, however, and her contributions make a difference. The house is large enough that theoretically four of us—Claudia, the sister, the baby, and I—could live together in peace. Is it so wrong to have a child with someone you love and respect but don’t love as a romantic partner?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="175" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdof002l3b732240gfae@published"&gt;While your situation is unconventional, it’s not “wrong.” Plenty of children are raised successfully in a wide array of unconventional circumstances. As long as you feel like your friendship has a solid footing to withstand the trials of child-rearing, you should be OK. Your kids likely won’t even notice that you’re not romantically involved with each other. In my experience, children spend the first few years making sure you can’t sleep, and then the next few years asking for snacks or video games. Their self-absorption supposedly ends somewhere in their mid-to-late twenties. Perhaps, someday, your child will tell their AI therapist that they have trouble with intimacy because their parents were “more friends than lovers.” If that gives you pause, consider the hundreds of thousands of children raised by crappy parents, or parents who “stay together for the kids” and then end up fighting constantly (which is in fact a worse environment for the kids). If you can provide multiple loving good adult role models in your household, no matter their romantic whims, you’re winning.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="218" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdof002m3b730zf207yy@published"&gt;The part that worries me here is the fighting between Claudia and her sister. Having fights in the house that are so bad that they make you want to rent another apartment&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; a suboptimal environment in which to raise a child. The three of you need to sit down and figure out exactly what your expectations are for how everyone is going to contribute to the household, and live together. I can guarantee that adding a baby to the mix is going to change your circumstances drastically. Don’t wait for the baby to arrive to make a bunch of lifestyle changes. You’ll have your hands full. Start making changes now. Maybe sister can go live in the rental so the two of you can handle parenting duties. If Claudia is cool with you maintaining a separate place to escape to, make sure you’re using it for your mental health, but not to escape your parental responsibilities. If help with the mortgage is really what you need, perhaps you could rent a room to someone who isn’t related to you (with clear expectations in place about the fact that there is a baby on the way). Or maybe you set a deadline to sell the house (even if it’s in a few years) and move somewhere more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdog002n3b73jc46od1j@published"&gt;It’s not the size of the house that matters, it’s the amount of space your issues take up. If you get along, any sized space will work. If you’re always fighting, all the rooms in the world won’t make it any better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgq001e3b73fw2eaccs@published"&gt;I have a daughter in high school, “Holly.” We don’t have the greatest school district, and the food they provide is filled with all sorts of processed crap that will kill you. I’ve made sure that she doesn’t have an account with the school cafeteria and instead I give her actually healthy lunches and snacks, mostly fruit and raw vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgu001f3b733ewlszn3@published"&gt;She’s been seeing this guy in some of her classes “John.” I’ve met him twice. He seems like a respectable young man, he gets very good grades, if a bit squeaky and timid around me. Ordinarily, I think he and Holly would be good for each other. But in the past few days, I’ve been noticing something that disturbs me on her school outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3erk200283b73hryii9ti@published"&gt;There have been suspicious crumbs. I asked her about it, and I found out what he’s been doing:  sharing food with her at school, including stuff he gets from that awful cafeteria. She knows that’s against the rules, and bad for her besides, but she says “it’s different when he shares with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgu001g3b73wolm39po@published"&gt;That’s utter nonsense. Bad food is bad food, and the only difference is I suppose she’s only eating half of that crud if he’s poisoning himself with it too. I can’t exactly go over to the school and make sure she eats healthy, and I’m not so dumb that I think that telling her to stay away from her boyfriend is going to help. How can I make sure my daughter doesn’t harm herself with this stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgu001j3b73dfp5hjq2@published"&gt;Oh boy are you in for a rude awakening as your daughter becomes an adult and starts to make her own decisions. You need to come to terms with the fact that you cannot control your child forever. And, just like Leia told Tarkin in Star Wars Episode IV, “The more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.” A little deviation from an existing healthy diet isn’t going to kill her, and if you come down too hard, you might cause a rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgv001k3b73tztknqqn@published"&gt;Not to freak you out even more, but there are tons of foods that fall into the “not good for you” category that don’t leave crumbs! Gummy worms? No crumbs! Sodapop? No crumbs! Vaping? No crumbs!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgv001l3b733mijka91@published"&gt;You will not be around all the time to check for crumbs or gummy-worm residue. Instead, you’re going to have to (gasp) &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; your kid to make good choices, and to talk to you about the choices they’re making. It sounds like your daughter trusts you enough that she didn’t lie to you about where the crumbs came from, so at least you have some foundation of trust here. Keep the conversation going. Ask &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; she wants to eat foods that she wouldn’t eat otherwise when it’s with John. Put yourself in her shoes! If your boyfriend offers you half a Twix and your response is either (a) “that food will kill you” or (b) “my mom says I can’t,” neither of those responses are going to lead to a make out session. (And, especially if she’s never been allowed to have candy bars at home, a few bites of Twix might sound really good.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgv001m3b737uy31a5u@published"&gt;Also, it doesn’t help to frame these foods as “bad,” “poisonous” or “killers” when she sees kids at school eating them all the time and they are still alive and well in the hallways. Sure, the American public school cafeteria diet is deplorable. But the effects of that diet take years and years to manifest. Also, for a lot of students, that’s the only food they’re going to eat that day. Looking down on that food as “bad food” could send the message that you think all those kids are choosing not to eat a healthy diet out of ignorance or recklessness. Disparaging all her classmates is another great way to increase the growing divide between the two of you. Work on treating her as an equal before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — Natalie Phelps was 38 when she gave birth to her second child and was blindsided by a life-altering diagnosis: colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news was a devastating blow.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To go home and look at your baby and think, 'I just gave birth to this baby and I might not get to see this baby grow up,'" Phelps recalled.  "It was crushing emotionally, but there was also a lot of disbelief and feelings of unfairness".&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phelps thought her symptoms -- weight loss, abdominal pain and unusual bowel movements -- were because of her pregnancy, not a sign of cancer.  She had no family history of colon cancer, so she never imagined it would be something so serious.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her primary care physician didn't initially consider cancer either. The doctor referred her to a therapist, suspecting that postpartum depression could be at the root of her symptoms. Phelps was simply too young for colon cancer, or so they thought.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a growing number of people under 50, like Phelps, are now being diagnosed with the disease, often years before they're due for their first recommended screening.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a 2023 report released by the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's now the deadliest cancer among young men and the second deadliest among young women.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rachel Issaka, gastroenterologist and researcher at Fred Hutch Cancer Center, has dedicated her career to studying the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer and its disparities.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think there is this misconception that colon cancer is an older person's disease, Dr. Issaka said.  "In some settings, there's even a misconception that it's only an older man's disease. And that's not true at all."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why screening guidelines changed in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommended age to begin screening used to be age 50.  People are now advised to begin screenings at age 45, with those having a family history of the disease potentially starting even earlier. Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for detection, as it can identify polyps before they turn into cancer. Additionally, a stool test and a new blood test, approved by the FDA last year, are now available options for early detection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This blood test is looking for circulating tumor DNA, and what that means is that cancers in the body can release specific signals that suggest that those are cancer cells compared to normal cells," Dr. Issaka said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is often called a "silent" disease. By the time symptoms appear, the cancer may already be in an advanced stage. However, when caught early, the five-year survival rate for colon cancer can be as high as 90%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Phelps was diagnosed, her cancer was at stage four.  Today, she is committed to raising awareness about the importance of screenings and the lack of funding for colorectal cancer research.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 30, the Seattle Mariners are hosting &lt;a title="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/tickets/specials/colorectal-cancer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/tickets/specials/colorectal-cancer"&gt;Strike Out Against Colorectal Cancer Day&lt;/a&gt;.  For every ticket sold, $8 will benefit the Colorectal Cancer Alliance's 2025 &lt;a title="https://impact.ccalliance.org/event/2025-seattle-walk-to-end-colon-cancer/e619275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://impact.ccalliance.org/event/2025-seattle-walk-to-end-colon-cancer/e619275"&gt;Seattle Walk to End Colon Cancer&lt;/a&gt; -- an event Phelps helps co-organize.  She'll be at the Mariners game helping to spark a conversation about a topic many people avoid.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We'll be having a game where you toss poo in a toilet, and then you get to keep a little ice pack shaped like poop," Phelps said. "Then you get this little QR code that is a quiz. You can take it home in private, and it'll ask you all the embarrassing questions about your poo. But at least with that, I'm hoping people will do that and start thinking and paying attention to their body and advocating if they are having symptoms or concerns with their primary doctor."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a685040.html"&gt;Lupron&lt;/a&gt; is a drug that suppresses sex hormones (a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist) and is used to treat prostate cancer, endometriosis, and precocious (early) puberty. It can also be used for &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/22402-chemical-castration"&gt;chemical castration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierOrder07.302.pdf"&gt;In a linked case&lt;/a&gt;, the state physician's board also found that David Geier, who worked closely with his father, was practicing medicine without a license. He was issued a civil fine of $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Numerous conceptual and scientific flaws”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two Geiers have published &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Geier+DA&amp;amp;cauthor_id=28595786"&gt;a long list of questionable studies&lt;/a&gt; in obscure journals claiming to find harms of vaccines and links to autism. One focus of their work has been to claim that thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative previously used in vaccines, causes autism. No credible evidence of harms from thimerosal has been found, according to the CDC. And regardless, the preservative was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html"&gt;largely removed from vaccines in 1999&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of their articles have drawn widespread criticism from scientific and medical experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 2003, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030604060812/http:/aap.org/profed/thimaut-may03.htm"&gt;the AAP blasted one of their articles&lt;/a&gt; that claimed to find a link between thimerosal and autism. The AAP said the paper "contains numerous conceptual and scientific flaws, omissions of fact, inaccuracies, and misstatements."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Post reached David Geier for comment on his role in the HHS and how he was hired, Geier said, "I don’t have any comment to say. Talk to the secretary [Kennedy]. He’s the person that’s in charge."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To experts, the conclusion of Geier's upcoming CDC study on vaccines and autism is a foregone one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It seems the goal of this administration is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t," Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds autism research, told the Post. "They are starting with the conclusion and looking to prove it. That’s not how science is done."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON D.C., DC — Health officials say Minnesota has recorded its first measles case of 2025, a rare instance where someone who has been vaccinated contracts the virus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple media reports say the unidentified person traveled from Minnesota to Washington D.C. and visited multiple locations over three days before feeling ill and going to an urgent care, where they were diagnosed. DC Health issued an alert Tuesday, saying the individual may have exposed large numbers of people while riding an Amtrak train and walking through a concourse in Union Station, among other stops. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; KARE 11 reporter Michelle Baik looked up that train's itinerary and found that passengers could have been exposed to the contagious person during stops in Boston, New York and Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post reports the Minnesotan was not contagious when they flew into the nation's capital, adding that they were vaccinated and appear to be recovering. The Centers for Disease Control says the measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after exposure for those who have received two doses, and 93% effective for those who have received a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials say you are at increased risk of getting measles if you've never had the disease or gotten vaccinated. Symptoms of the virus include fever, rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declining vaccination rates following the COVID pandemic are blamed for several recent measles outbreaks, including situations in West Texas and New Mexico that involve nearly 300 infections. In 2025, a total of 378 cases have been reported in 18 jurisdictions across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jayne Griffith, Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologist, gave the following statement to KARE 11 Wednesday morning: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"On March 24, a case of measles was confirmed in an adult who lives in Hennepin County and had recently traveled domestically and internationally. The person was not infectious while in Minnesota, so there were no exposures in Minnesota from this case. We are still investigating where this person acquired measles."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/7O9PGLwf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8nj1e70001r26p430xt1dih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (&lt;strong&gt;CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;Puberty: It’s one of the most important milestones in a young person’s life. It’s also one of the most awkward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000g3b6myzkotptx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hormonal shifts lead to massive changes in body and mind, including growth spurts beyond just height, hair growth beyond just the head, mood swings beyond just tantrums and, for most, a sexual awakening. The process can be fraught with anxiety, insecurity and emotional upheaval for all involved, beyond the person going through it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000h3b6mjv5kjcwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Puberty in its narrowest definition means the path to sexual maturation,” Dr. Cara Natterson&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000i3b6mq6z19hrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you start puberty, you cannot be part of a baby-making equation. And when you finish puberty, you can potentially be part of making a baby,” she said. The broader definition, she said, includes the effects from all of those sex hormones — estrogen, progesterone and testosterone — including “mood swings, friendship shifts, shifts in the way kids make decisions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000j3b6mp8yfif09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Natterson, a pediatrician, is the author of the updated best-selling series for girls, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Care-Keeping-You-American-Wellbeing/dp/1683372301" target="_blank"&gt;The Care and Keeping of You&lt;/a&gt;,” and the ensuing separate volume for boys, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guy-Stuff-Body-Book-Boys/dp/1683370260/" target="_blank"&gt;Guy Stuff&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000k3b6mh8uc6iog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it wasn’t until her own children hit adolescence that she realized there wasn’t enough information out there. “My kids went into puberty, and it became very clear to me that we needed a whole lot more than  my little book and everyone else’s little books,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000l3b6m3hza1tez@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help fill that void and ratchet down the mystery (and sometimes shame) of this stage of life, she and a friend cocreated the platform &lt;a href="https://lessawkward.com/" target="_blank"&gt;lessawkward.com&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000m3b6mg5bt8err@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the process of puberty hasn’t changed, the timing has.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000n3b6m7gz5zlz0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Puberty (globally) is starting earlier, and we’ve known this for a long time,” Natterson said. This younger start might be happening for a variety of reasons, she said, including changes in average weight of children, environmental factors and relentless psycho-social stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000o3b6mr981kkzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm8njdb9000203b6m2q23if2r@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;

            Muddling the picture, puberty is often conflated with a separate, but closely related, biological process.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000r3b6mq0rznppi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s this thing called ‘adrenarche’ that is caused when the adrenal glands release their hormones, DHEA and DHEAS,” Natterson said, noting that they are cousins of estrogen and testosterone. These hormones tell the body to make more sweat and, in certain places, to make it with greasier, thicker proteins, and to sprout more hair.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000s3b6myn25aykn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It happens around the same time as puberty, but in some kids, it can happen much earlier. So, a 5-year-old can have pubic hair, and they’re not in puberty. Or a 15-year-old can be well through puberty and have no body odor, no greasiness and no pubic hair growth. It’s confusing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000t3b6mmpb7hfm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Should parents worry? And if so, when?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000u3b6mtzc350yv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any adult who thinks the kid in their life is going into puberty and they have a question or a concern, reach out to a health care provider,” Natterson said . The pediatrician will talk to your child and also perform a physical exam to determine what, exactly, is going on. A parent may be asked to wait outside, depending on the child’s age, but can ask questions after.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000v3b6mwpna024o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to help your child navigate this potentially challenging stage of life?  Natterson wants parents to keep these five things in mind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000w3b6mw0tbig0c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The (average) age is 8-9 for girls and 9-10 for boys, which means it is happening 2-3 years sooner than it did for many of us,” Natterson said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000x3b6m2a5xmxkq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said that when she was in medical school, students were taught that the start of puberty, typically with the onset of breast development, begins at 11 or 11 and a half. But then a groundbreaking &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/99/4/505/75275/Secondary-Sexual-Characteristics-and-Menses-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;study of 17,000 girls&lt;/a&gt; was published in 1997, showing that the average age for the start of breast development was 9.96 years for White girls and  8.87 years for Black girls.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000y3b6m1dp0v0fz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another study of more than 1,200 girls, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20696727/" target="_blank"&gt;published in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, sought to confirm those findings. “And it didn’t just confirm it, it moved the starting point even further,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000z3b6mqqhrg94c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Starting in 2010 … we knew that the average age of breast development for a girl fell somewhere between 8 and 9 in this country,” she said. “And for boys, the start of puberty looks like testicular and penile growth, which frankly, most parents have no idea is happening … That average age is between 9 and 10.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00103b6my5r1kn5s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s different — that’s two years different — from when we were growing up,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00113b6mi0e77tt7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So what is a “normal” age to show signs of puberty?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00123b6mdu3w1fjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before age 7 for a girl, before age 8 for a boy … (if) you start seeing changes in the body, you want to bring in a medical thinker,” Natterson said. “But you noticed I’m not using the word ‘concerned’ or ‘worried’ because there are a lot of red herrings here. There are a lot of things that can look like puberty that aren’t puberty.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00133b6mwye3mmjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Oh, and by the way, if they’re 12 and nothing has happened, that is also normal,” she said. “So now wrap your brain around a five- or six-year spread of ‘normal’ onset of body changes. That’s really hard for everyone to manage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00143b6mdf25iuxa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not moving faster, but rather slower!” Natterson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00153b6mo3ig9dmj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She was taught, again in medical school, that puberty takes about two to four years. “It’s a sprint, and you get through it, and it’s super awkward, and your body changes, and then you’re done,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00163b6mc35w96es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But nowadays, Natterson said, “it takes nearly a decade for kids to get through it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00173b6m4lpf2ssw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coming of age is radically different today compared to 20 years ago in part thanks to screens, Natterson pointed out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00183b6myf567fmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Devices — cellphones  for sure, but also iPads and laptops and video consoles, too — are shifting the ways kids travel through their tween and teen years both physically and emotionally,” she said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00193b6m6c0jyu8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Take sleep. The devices themselves, both their engrossing content and their blue light, keep kids up later into the night, in turn reducing their sleep. When devices are kept in the bedroom, pinging notifications interrupt sleep or prevent us from entering deep sleep cycles,” she said. “Less sleep impacts everything from their metabolism to their growth. Emotionally, too little sleep reduces focus and exacerbates mental health issues and shifts overall mood, all of which affect friendships, sibling dynamics, romantic relationships, and more.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001a3b6mjk8b6gm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Interrupted sleep is just one example of the impact of screens, Natterson said. “Their very content has direct effects on self-esteem, risk taking behaviors, choices about what to put into and onto their bodies,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001b3b6mt3si10b4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And that content might also include pornography.      “The average age of first porn viewing in this country is 12 … and 15% of 10-year-olds have seen it,” she said. (Those statistics are based on teens’ self-reported use of pornography in &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/new-report-reveals-truths-about-how-teens-engage-with-pornography" target="_blank"&gt;a 2022 survey&lt;/a&gt; from Common Sense Media.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “If you’re not having conversations like this — about all of this: smells and feelings and sex and all of it — if you’re not having those conversations with the kids in your lives, someone else is,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Puberty affects the body and brain
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001d3b6merir7b1x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The same sex hormones that change the body also impact the brain,” Natterson said, “which explains everything from mood swings to social shifts to decision making.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001e3b6muife0bbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sex hormones  — whether they are estrogen and progesterone, which govern female puberty, or testosterone, which governs male puberty — they circle around the brain. They change the way the neurons fire. They change the way moods are expressed,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001f3b6mnx4om8vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(Pediatric endocrinologist and researcher) Louise Greenspan says the first sign of puberty is not breast development or penile and testicular growth. It is a slamming door. I love that line; it is absolutely true,” she said. “That is, all those hormones rising and falling and coursing through the brain and changing the way the brain feels and the way it reacts — it has to be a setup for mental health issues if we are not talking about it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001g3b6me4pq7vm8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally conversations that take place “many, many times over many years,” Natterson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001h3b6miaxvszk2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s one piece of advice  I can give the adults who care about kids, it’s this: realize that they’re interested in being in the conversation with you, even if they don’t speak,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001i3b6mkn6wthd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Ask them questions, and then zip it and listen to what they have to say. Because if you can stop filling the space with your own words, you’re going to learn how much all of these outside factors are bearing down on their life. They just need space to speak.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001j3b6msl8agx8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That said, it might be awkward, and it might be hard. To talk to her son, Natterson said she would sit outside of his closed bedroom door and chat; over time that door opened. “He was almost invariably sitting at his desk in his chair, and I would go lay down on his bed and look straight up at the ceiling, and I’d be like, ‘Hey, dude, how you doing?’ And he’d start talking. No eye contact,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001k3b6mo46wl19r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But my laying on his bed and him sitting at his desk with his back to me was a place and a way that we could get into some of our best conversations.” Other similar no-eye-contact locations are in the car and on walks, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001l3b6m549urmy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also, it might not go perfectly. “When  you mess the conversation up, which we all do (!), just take a do-over and try again,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001m3b6mf88ty6oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remi Bader is coming clean about undergoing weight-loss surgery after sidestepping speculation for months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The influencer &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/remi-bader-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;opened up to Self&lt;/a&gt; about her single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy in an interview published Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She spoke about having the procedure, which involved “cut[ting] out 80 percent of [her] stomach,” in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Remi Bader revealed her weight-loss surgery after months of speculation. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Remi Bader/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The influencer told Self about choosing to have a single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;remibader/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She shared the same on “Khloé in Wonder Land.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Khloe Kardashian/X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Bader said she chose the surgery after struggling with debilitating back pain, excessive sweat, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, heart issues, fatty liver disease and infertility fears.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, after the 30-year-old went under the knife, she spent “hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up” — and despite being discharged from the hospital after three days, she continued vomiting for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bader subsequently fell into a “very, very deep depression” and “wanted to die.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The procedure involved cutting out “80 percent” of the model’s stomach. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Remi Bader/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The “brutal” recovery led to Bader falling into a “deep depression.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images for The Recording Academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

				&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The TikTok star, who has since been prescribed antidepressants, told the magazine how she is doing one year post-op.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My binge eating is better,” she explained. “I’m still struggling and I have those thoughts, but I can’t physically binge as much because I don’t have the room for it. You cannot drink and eat within the same 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes I’m out to dinner with friends, and I run to the bathroom. It’s also hard; I’m going to these events and dinners, and I’m constantly getting sick,” Bader continued, saying she also suffered hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bader lost “more than 140 pounds in less than a year.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;GC Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She called the “quick” transformation “confusing.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While reflecting on her “quick” transformation, Baden admitted that it has been “really confusing to be … in a different body but have the exact same brain” because she “never wanted to be this size” and wished to remain “curvy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model &lt;a href="https://x.com/i/events/1875987636159905792" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shared more of her story on Wednesday’s episode of the “Khloé in Wonder Land” podcast&lt;/a&gt;, revealing she lost “more than 140 pounds in less than a year”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She clarified that &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/article/celebrities-who-used-ozempic-for-weight-loss/"&gt;taking Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; was just a “Band Aid” for her prior to her surgery — but doubled down on the “brutal” recovery being the “worst” experience of her life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bader said she “never wanted to be this size” and liked being “curvy.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/@remibader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She stopped publicly speaking about her weight in 2023 due to “ridiculous” body shaming. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/@remibader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bader has not been speaking publicly about her weight and her health since September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, she &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/09/18/remi-bader-sobs-as-she-begs-followers-to-stop-commenting-on-weight-gain/"&gt;sobbed while begging “disgusting” trolls to stop&lt;/a&gt; their “ridiculous … &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/06/14/remi-bader-turned-away-at-montauk-ranch-called-fat-bitch/"&gt;body-shaming” over her fluctuating figure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My health journey will now be my business,” Bader said. “It’s really not fair to just see really mean, mean things. I’m taking care of myself the best that I can.”&lt;/p&gt;

This large-scale umbrella review analyzed data from over 258,000 participants and found that low- to moderate-intensity activities like yoga, Tai Chi, and even exergames significantly benefit cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children and teens saw the greatest memory gains, while people with ADHD experienced notable improvements in executive function. The findings highlight that even small bursts of movement can have profound cognitive effects, making exercise an accessible and essential brain-health strategy for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Cognitive Boosts:&lt;/strong&gt; Yoga, Tai Chi, and exergames showed the strongest improvements in memory and cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Gains in brain function were observed within just 1–3 months of regular exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Low- to moderate-intensity exercise benefited all age groups, especially children and those with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether it’s an early morning jog, or a touch of Tai Chi, groundbreaking research from the University of South Australia shows that any form of exercise can significantly boost brain function and memory across children, adults, and older adults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the largest, most comprehensive umbrella review to date, researchers found that regular exercise improves general cognition, memory, and executive function in both healthy individuals and those with clinical conditions, reinforcing exercise as an essential, inclusive activity for optimising cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108246"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man running." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Senior researcher, Professor Carol Maher says exercise should be encouraged as a cognitive health strategy across all ages and fitness levels. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthesising findings from 133 systematic reviews, covering 2724 randomised controlled trials and 258,279 participants, the systematic umbrella and meta-meta-analysis found that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;low- to moderate-intensity exercise had the greatest benefits for brain function and memory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;children and adolescents showed the greatest improvements in memory, while people with ADHD saw the biggest gains in executive function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;yoga, Tai Chi, and exergames (active video games) delivered the most significant cognitive benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher, UniSA’s Dr Ben Singh, says the findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how different types, intensities, and durations of exercise influence cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise has a profound effect on physical health, but we also know it benefits brain function. What this study confirms is that even low-intensity exercise – like yoga or walking – can improve cognition, making it accessible to people of all ages and abilities,” Dr Singh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In particular, we found that benefits were delivered quickly – with clear gains within 1-3 months, highlighting that even small bursts of activity can make a big difference. It also signals that trying out new activities could play a key role in keeping the brain engaged and active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For children and teens, exercise was especially beneficial for developing memory, while for people with ADHD, it helped improve focus, reduce impulsivity, and enhance executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found that mind-body exercises, like Tai Chi and yoga, had the most significant impact on memory, while exergames – such as Pokémon Go – were highly effective for general cognition. This is an encouraging finding, as it suggests that engaging, low-impact activities can offer real cognitive benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior researcher, Professor Carol Maher says exercise should be encouraged as a cognitive health strategy across all ages and fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases are growing global health concerns, underscoring the urgent need to identify effective strategies to preserve and enhance cognitive function across the lifespan,” Prof Maher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study presents compelling evidence that exercise should be integrated into healthcare and education settings to promote cognitive well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing that even small amounts of exercise can improve memory and brain function – especially for those at higher risk – presents a clear opportunity for exercise to be included in clinical and public health guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ddcf3f3fcfff8f1b3d0fcf3eefbf4f8f1f9dde8f3f4eefcb3f8f9e8b3fce8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annabel Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unisa.edu.au"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annabel Mansfield – University of South Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effectiveness of exercise for improving cognition, memory and executive function: a systematic umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Ben Singh et al. &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effectiveness of exercise for improving cognition, memory and executive function: a systematic umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;To evaluate systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of exercise on general cognition, memory and executive function across all populations and ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs evaluating the effects of exercise on general cognition, memory and executive function were eligible. Data extraction and risk of bias scoring were conducted in duplicate. The A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) was used to assess the risk of bias. Effect sizes were pooled using random effects models and reported as standardised mean differences (SMD).

Exercise significantly improved general cognition (SMD=0.42), memory (SMD=0.26) and executive function (SMD=0.24). Memory and executive function improvements from exercise were greater for children and adolescents than for adults and older adults. Those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder exhibited greater improvement in executive function than other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-6"&gt;Effects were generally larger for low- and moderate-intensity interventions. Shorter interventions (1–3 months) and exergames (video games that require physical movement) had the largest effects on general cognition and memory.

In some cases, it may even lead to abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the Lebanese man did not present any such symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Louis Chaptini, senior author of the new case report said: 'That's the part that makes this case so fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The patient didn't have the classic symptoms. No heartburn. No food impaction. Just hiccups that wouldn't go away.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being able to identify his condition through his blood test, the experts involved found it difficult to understand how eosinophilic esophagitis was causing him to constantly hiccup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, they theorized the buildup of eosinophils in his esophagus might have triggered impulses in the vagal nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Louis Chaptini, senior author of the new case report noted that the patient did not show any regular symptoms of the condition &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To test the theory, the doctors gave him a topical steroid to use, which helped cure his hiccups and he found relief within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His eosinophil count also dropped back to a normal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors concluded: 'EoE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chronic refractory hiccups even when the typical symptoms of EoE are lacking, and prompt treatment with topical steroids should be considered.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no cure for the condition, treatments such as steroids and an acid blocker like a proton pump inhibitor can help address the inflammation and manage symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case was &lt;span&gt;published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-025-05044-1#Sec2"&gt;Journal of Medical Case Reports&lt;/a&gt; on March 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

improves cognition and working memory, and may aid in slowing cognitive decline. Omega-3s play a role in mood regulation, helping the brain communicate using the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, and reducing inflammation in the brain, which has been linked to depression,” Pincus says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="13" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Avocado&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Avocados not only offer healthy fats which &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(22)01132-7/fulltext" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(22)01132-7/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="14.1.0"&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show boost overall health, but they also contain Omega-3s. “Omega-3 is needed for the brain cell membranes,” Duffy Dillon explains. “It is also required to create myelin sheaths, the coating surrounding nerves which help transmit messages throughout the body.”&lt;br data-node-id="14.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="15" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Moon says polyphenols have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that work to reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain so that it can function at its best. Dark chocolate is high in cacao polyphenols, making it a tasty brain food (in moderation). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Polyphenols also “improve blood flow to the brain, which means a better supply of nutrients and oxygen to fuel how we think, learn, and remember,” Moon says. Science backs this up. One small &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024004614" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024004614" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="study" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.1.0"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that adults who ate chocolate high in cacao polyphenols performed better on a cognitive test than those who ate chocolate low in cacao polyphenols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="18" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Pistachios&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Pistachios have a high antioxidant capacity that rivals that of popular antioxidant-containing foods, and they are a plant-based source of complete protein,” explains Lauren Pincus, M.S., R.D.N., author of &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;The Protein-Packed Breakfast Club&lt;/em&gt;. “Foods that are high in antioxidants can be a powerful weapon against disease and premature aging of your body and your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Wild blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Eating “wild blueberries regularly may be an effective way to enhance some aspects of brain function and maintain others,” Pincus explains. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768899/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768899/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Studies" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown wild blueberries can improve executive function, enhance memory, may slow down age-related cognitive decline, and improve metabolic health which benefits brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Leafy greens like spinach and kale offer major brain-healthy nutrients like “vitamin K, lutein, folate, and beta carotene,” Pincus says. In fact, she points to a &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000004815" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000004815" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="study" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that showed that around one serving a day of green leafy vegetables may help slow cognitive decline associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="24" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Various types of beans “contain folate, iron, magnesium, and antioxidants, which are all important to maintaining good brain health,” Pincus says. “Folate plays a role in neurodevelopment and cognitive function while iron helps with oxygen transport to the brain. Magnesium supports numerous biochemical reactions in the brain and helps with neurotransmitter regulation. Antioxidants like polyphenols help protect brain cells from oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="26" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Pumpkin seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Pumpkin seeds contain antioxidants that may protect the body and brain from free-radical damage. They’re also an excellent source of other nutrients important for brain health, including magnesium, zinc, iron, and copper,” says Simmons. Duffy Dillon also recommends seeds as a source of magnesium, which she says helps boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Simmons explains that eggs are a good source of nutrients tied to brain health, including vitamins B6 and B12, folate, and choline. Moon says egg yolks are packed with choline. “The brain needs choline to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that supports early brain development and lifelong memory maintenance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="30" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Green tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28899506/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28899506/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" data-node-id="31.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="31.0.0"&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that green tea may help with cognition. Simmons says, “Green tea contains caffeine, which may boost brain function and improve alertness, performance, memory, and focus,” she says. &lt;br data-node-id="31.2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="32" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Broccoli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Simmons points to broccoli as another brain-boosting food. “Broccoli also contains compounds such as sulforaphane that provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and may help protect the brain against damage. Sulforaphane levels are highly concentrated in broccoli sprouts,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="34" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Trout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ideal for those observing a pescatarian eating plan, or people simply looking to change up their menu, trout is a great brain food option. The fish is chock full of Omega-3s, which Duffy Dillon recommends adding to your menu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="36" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Corn tortillas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Corn tortillas contain lutein, which Moon says, “is a carotenoid with antioxidant benefits that also happens to make foods yellow or green, making them easy to spot in the produce department. “Lutein collects in the brain and eye area to protect them against oxidative stress,” she says. “We need this because the brain uses 20% of our oxygen, making it susceptible to oxidative stress.” Duffy Dillon also recommends corn tortillas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="38" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;High in Omega-3s, chia seeds are another great choice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589531/#Abs1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589531/#Abs1" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Studies" data-node-id="39.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that chia seeds may aid in cognition.

&lt;p&gt;It can be frustrating to see your child act on impulse and pay for it. Impulsivity is one reason people with unmanaged ADHD are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763421000567" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7850915" data-affiliate="true"&gt;more accident prone&lt;/a&gt; than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While instructing your child to think before acting may seem reasonable, said McClure, ADHD impulse control challenges are rooted in neurology. Kids with ADHD “often struggle to pause and reflect before acting, not because they don’t want to, but because their brain processes information differently,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than criticize your child for their brain-based differences, help them build skills in ways that feel natural and empowering, offered McClure. You could say, “I notice your brain wants to go fast right now. What would help slow things down?” or “It’s OK to get excited. Let’s figure out what will help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. “You signed up for this — you can’t quit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids with ADHD are often deeply engaged when they’re interested in something. Such passionate attention, known as hyperfocus, can serve as a mighty &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X24000129" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7850915" data-affiliate="true"&gt;ADHD strength&lt;/a&gt;. When your child isn’t into an activity, however, their involvement can plummet to zero. And that’s OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Forcing an ADHD child to stick with an activity they no longer enjoy, one that doesn’t play to their strengths or one that has become overwhelming, can lead to discouragement and emotional dysregulation,” McClure said. Because ADHD brains thrive on engagement, autonomy and flexibility, she added, “rigid expectations can create stress, rather than resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than forcing your child to stay committed to something unappealing, McClure recommends supporting them in “making adjustments that foster self-awareness, emotional regulation, and the ability to advocate for their needs — skills they’ll need for life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. “Sit still.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Despite not being at the epicenter of the outbreak, the number of people being vaccinated has increased, according to Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We're 75 miles east of the actual outbreak, but we're seeing an increase in the number of vaccinations that we're giving in our community," she told ABC News. "Over the last four weeks, our health department has been operating a walk-in vaccine clinic that's just for MMR, and that vaccine clinic [has] administered a little over 300 vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She added that health officials have seen multiple babies under 6 months old who have been exposed to measles. Because they are too young to be vaccinated, they have been given shots of immunoglobulin, which are antibodies that act as a post-exposure prophylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wells said the vaccines are available at no cost, and health officials have been trying to spread the word over social media and the local news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So we're kind of just getting the people that, I think, either their children are behind on vaccines, just because parents get busy and it's hard to get your four-year-old sometimes into the doctor's office, or people that were kind of on the fence about vaccines and maybe said, 'Well, I don't want to vaccinate my kids, because you never see measles.'

"They're finding different locations in order to have those clinics; they're starting to focus a lot more on school-based clinics. So, let's go to where the children are and get the parents to come to that school and then offer the vaccine there, which I think is a great tactic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, in nearby New Mexico, the state Department of Health (NMDOH) &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 43 measles cases so far this year.

			&lt;p&gt;The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156185" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; in the break room at work could contain high levels of substances that elevate levels of 'bad' cholesterol in your blood – but there's a simple way to reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diterpene"&gt;Diterpenes&lt;/a&gt; are compounds made by plants that have a variety of effects on the human body. Two of them – &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafestol"&gt;cafestol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahweol"&gt;kahweol&lt;/a&gt; – have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20174238"&gt;linked to increased levels&lt;/a&gt; of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. &lt;span&gt;High levels of these compounds have been found in coffee, but it seems to depend on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-best-way-to-brew-coffee-depends-on-what-you-want-from-your-java"&gt;how you extract it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swedish researchers measured the levels of diterpenes in coffee made by a range of common coffee machines and brewing techniques. They found that boiling a big pot of coffee is the worst offender, but you can easily offset those levels by filtering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee machines commonly found in workplaces around the world also produced cups of joe with relatively high diterpene levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We studied 14 coffee machines and could see that the levels of these substances are much higher in coffee from these machines than from regular drip-filter coffee makers," &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-03-21-cholesterol-elevating-substances-in-coffee-from-machines-at-work"&gt;says David Iggman&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical nutritionist at Uppsala University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From this we infer that the filtering process is crucial for the presence of these cholesterol-elevating substances in coffee."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team calculated the benefits for a person drinking three cups of coffee a day, five days a week. Swapping the machine coffee for a nice paper-filtered java could reduce LDL cholesterol by enough to cut the relative risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by 13 percent over 5 years, and 36 percent over 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected samples from 11 machines that brewed coffee from grinds mixed with hot water and passed through a metal filter, and from a further three that mixed a liquid coffee concentrate with hot water without filtration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, the team also brewed coffee themselves using a range of methods, including drip-brew, percolator, French press, and boiled coffee. Samples from each method and machine were then frozen for storage and transport, before being analyzed for diterpene concentration. &lt;span&gt;In addition, the team collected four espresso samples from three cafeterias and a workplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156189" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-642x366.jpg" alt="How You Make Your Coffee Could Affect Your Cholesterol Intake" class="wp-image-156189 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-642x366.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-728x415.jpg 728w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-768x438.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-1536x875.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol-600x342.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/coffee-cafestol.jpg 1555w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156189" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;How the different brewing methods stack up in terms of cafestol concentrations. (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2025.103933"&gt;Orrje et. al, &lt;em&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, 2025&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that manual methods of brewing coffee generally resulted in lower diterpene levels than grabbing a cup from a machine, &lt;span&gt;whether it be a brewing machine, a liquid-model machine, or a traditional espresso maker&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a glance, espresso seemed to be the worst way to make coffee, with a median cafestol level of around 1,060 mg/L. But there were only four samples analyzed and their levels varied wildly, from 35.6 to a staggering 2,446.7 mg/L. As such, it's hard to pull much meaning out of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee from liquid and brewing machine models had a median cafestol concentration of 174 milligrams per liter, and 135 mg/L of kahweol. French presses produced coffees with moderate diterpene levels, coming in under 90 mg/L for cafestol and under 70 mg/L for kahweol, while percolators had similar readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best option seemed to be paper-filtered drip brews, clocking a median of just 11.5 mg/L of cafestol and 8.2 mg/L for kahweol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exception was boiled coffee, a typically unfiltered method that's common in countries such as Sweden. Getting your  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="156185" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; fix this way resulted in a massive mean concentration of just under 940 mg/L of cafestol and nearly 680 mg/L of kahweol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156292" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642.jpg" alt="filtering coffee" class="wp-image-156292 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/filter-coffee-642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156292" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Filtering coffee could make a big difference to your health. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEdcijLL8g/"&gt;Andreantian/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, it's easy to slash those levels. When the researchers filtered their boiled coffee through fabric, concentrations dropped to just 28 mg/L for cafestol and 21 mg/L for kahweol. They used a sock for some reason, but any cloth or paper filter should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also acknowledges that the study has major limitations, including small sample sizes and variables that went unaccounted for, like filter pore size, water pressure, and temperature, and how the beans were roasted and ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings join a growing and often conflicting body of research into the health effects of coffee – and it's hard to know how it all fits together. Other studies, for instance, have found that drinking three or more cups of coffee per day could &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;lower your risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing cardiometabolic diseases by 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular coffee consumption has also been linked to lower risks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-coffee-and-tea-drinkers-could-be-lowering-their-risk-of-dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-help-protect-against-parkinsons-study-says"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-protect-against-certain-types-of-skin-cancer"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-tea-or-coffee-each-day-could-reduce-mouth-and-throat-cancer-risk"&gt;mouth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-dramatically-lowers-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer-coming-back"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;. It could offset the negative health effects of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-lower-risk-of-death-from-too-much-sitting"&gt;prolonged sitting&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/giant-study-links-drinking-coffee-with-almost-2-extra-years-of-life"&gt;extend your life&lt;/a&gt; by years. But that could all depend on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/four-cups-of-coffee-a-day-might-be-the-perfect-amount-of-your-heart"&gt;how many cups&lt;/a&gt; you down per day, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-health-perks-of-coffee-depend-on-when-you-drink-it-suggests-study"&gt;what time&lt;/a&gt; you drink them – and now, how you brew it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most of the coffee samples contained levels that could feasibly affect the levels of LDL cholesterol of people who drank the coffee, as well as their future risk of cardiovascular disease," &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-03-21-cholesterol-elevating-substances-in-coffee-from-machines-at-work"&gt;says Iggman&lt;/a&gt;. "For people who drink a lot of coffee every day, it's clear that drip-filter coffee, or other well-filtered coffee, is preferable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2025.103933"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(13 News) - Casino Del Sol has confirmed that a norovirus outbreak caused the cancellation of a large convention over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Wild Wild West Steampunk Convention was set for March 20-23 at the casino. But on Saturday, Casino Del Sol canceled the rest of the event over “ongoing medical concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;On Tuesday, the casino sent a release to 13 News and explained more about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Casino Del Sol was informed that individuals attending a private event at our property were experiencing illness,” the casino said. “An individual associated with the event informed Casino Del Sol management that a guest of the group reported that she had norovirus and at least two attendees were already ill before arriving at the event. By Saturday, March 22, additional attendees, as well as a few Casino Del Sol team members, reported experiencing stomach flu-like symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Wild West Steampunk Convention &lt;a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/843226430/Wild-West-Steampunk-Convention-news-release" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;issued a news release&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday and said it had not received an official reason for the cancellation until Casino Del Sol issued its release to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It seems Casino Del Sol has put out a press release this evening confirming norovirus as the cause of their decision to close Wild Wild West Con,” the WWSC wrote. “We want to be clear that this is the first time we have been made aware of this development and it was provided to the press rather than to our staff or management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;13 News went to the casino Saturday and saw no signs about the event on the property or near the conference center, where it was held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Pascua Yaqui Tribal Medical Authority and the casino said it “took immediate action to mitigate potential health risks.” The casino reported that the conference center, public restrooms and the rooms the ill guests were staying were deep cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Several people on social media complained about the short notice for the cancellation. The casino said vendors and attendees were told two hours ahead that they had to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“This timeline was determined based on the need to swiftly clear the area so that cleaning and sanitization efforts could begin immediately,” the casino said. “While we recognize that this created challenges for some vendors, the health and safety of all guests and team members had to take priority in order to prevent potential further spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Some people on social media also complained about the lack of information that was released during the weekend and the fact that the casino remained open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“We understand that there has been a strong desire for immediate information, and we appreciate the patience of our guests and the public while we worked to verify details and ensure that the information we provided was accurate,” the casino said. “Our priority throughout this process has been the well-being of our guests, team members, and the greater community. By acting quickly, we were able to contain the situation and reduce the potential for further illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Still others on social media called out the WWWSC for deleting a social media post made Saturday afternoon. The WWWSC said it did so “at the insistence of (Casino Del Sol) in an effort to maintain a working relationship during a difficult situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The WWWSC said it asked Pima County about the incident and was told “the Pascua Yaqui Health Department is managing the outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divider | border-bottom mx-auto w-75 my-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entire Casino Del Sol Statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Casino Del Sol was informed that individuals attending a private event at our property were experiencing illness. An individual associated with the event informed Casino Del Sol management that a guest of the group reported that she had norovirus and at least two attendees were already ill before arriving at the event. By Saturday, March 22, additional attendees, as well as a few Casino Del Sol team members, reported experiencing stomach flu-like symptoms.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;In coordination with the Pascua Yaqui Tribal Medical Authority, Casino Del Sol took immediate action to mitigate potential health risks. Out of an abundance of caution, the decision was made to conclude the event early and begin a deep cleaning of the conference center. Additionally, all hotel rooms that housed event guests were placed on hold to undergo a deep cleaning and sanitization process, in line with our already rigorous cleaning protocols.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vendors and attendees were given two hours’ notice to vacate the event space. This timeline was determined based on the need to swiftly clear the area so that cleaning and sanitization efforts could begin immediately. While we recognize that this created challenges for some vendors, the health and safety of all guests and team members had to take priority in order to prevent potential further spread.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some hotel guests experienced a disruption to their stay, while others did not. This was based on the origin of the reported illness. As an added precaution, all occupied hotel rooms and public restrooms underwent an enhanced deep-cleaning and sanitization process in addition to the hotel’s already robust and comprehensive cleaning procedures for every room. Guests who were not affiliated with the event were not impacted by this precautionary measure.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;We understand that there has been a strong desire for immediate information, and we appreciate the patience of our guests and the public while we worked to verify details and ensure that the information we provided was accurate.

By acting quickly, we were able to contain the situation and reduce the potential for further illness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;While we regret the circumstances that led to the early conclusion of the event, we stand by our commitment to upholding the highest health and safety standards. We remain vigilant and prepared to take any necessary steps to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for all who visit Casino Del Sol.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divider | border-bottom mx-auto w-75 my-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="header | article-header w-100"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Entire Wild Wild West Steampunk Convention Statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:JJNCTILEIJBR7DXAQKMFAPSOCY" data-fusion-component="JJNCTILEIJBR7DXAQKMFAPSOCY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:JJNCTILEIJBR7DXAQKMFAPSOCY" data-fusion-component="JJNCTILEIJBR7DXAQKMFAPSOCY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Be sure to subscribe to the 13 News YouTube channel: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/@13newskold"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;www.youtube.com/@13newskold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 13 News.

The breakfast staple is an excellent addition to &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/how-to-make-a-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, hearty oatmeal, or, on its own, slathered in peanut butter. And, as a fruit with natural packaging, it's easy to carry on the go for a quick snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've all heard the saying, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." For many, the versatile fruit is a regular part of the daily diet. But just how healthy is it to eat a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/best-banana-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt; every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian nutritionist, shares her insight on everything we need to know about eating bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let's get to the nutrition. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, one medium banana has about 105 calories, 27 carbs, 14 grams of sugar, 5 grams of fiber, and 422 mg of potassium. It's also a good source of other nutrients like vitamin C and vitamin B6 and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/what-are-electrolytes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:electrolytes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;, including magnesium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is estimated that 90% of Americans are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/roasted-vegetable-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vegetables;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; every day," Manaker says. "So, if someone wants to eat a banana every day, that can be a great habit to get into to get some fruit servings in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential Downsides Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But bananas might not be the ideal pick for everyone. Manaker says they might not be the best choice for those following a low-potassium diet or those who get elevated blood sugar after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas contain carbohydrates and sugars, which raises questions about whether they're a healthy food for people with diabetes. However, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, bananas contain resistant starch, similar to fiber, and release less glucose into the bloodstream than non-resistant starches, like white bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to their carb content, bananas are known for their potassium, an important electrolyte vital to cell and muscle function and heart health. Potassium and sodium work together and need to be in balance. Hyperkalemia occurs when your blood potassium levels are too high, although this condition is rare. Medical experts estimate that only 2% to 3% of people have high potassium levels, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For a generally healthy person, it is unlikely to experience hyperkalemia by eating one banana a day, especially if the rest of their diet isn't excessively high in potassium-rich foods," Manaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yes, a banana a day is most likely safe. But this depends on your individual health and diet. Overall, Manaker recommends people eat a variety of fruits and veggies. "While eating a banana every day isn't bad for many people, it may be more beneficial to eat different fruits, with bananas sprinkled into the rotation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She adds that the amount of bananas someone can eat in a day depends on the rest of their daily diet. For someone with a stomach bug who can only stomach bananas, she said that having more than one is likely acceptable. But it's probably not the best idea for those eating many bananas on top of "mass quantities" of carbohydrate-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they say, too much of anything—even fruits—can have its downsides, so it's best to aim for a balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired of plain old bananas? Put your produce to use with a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/healthy-peanut-butter-banana-smoothie-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:peanut butter banana smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;peanut butter banana smoothie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/banana-nut-bread-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana nut bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;banana nut bread&lt;/a&gt; (to use up those super ripe ones).

Researchers have now discovered that postpartum female mice develop a long-term preference for cooler environments, driven by brain changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes involve a specific group of neurons in the preoptic area (POA) that express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Postpartum mice showed reduced warm sensitivity and increased cold sensitivity in these neurons, helping explain their new thermal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Postpartum mice preferred cooler environments for over four weeks after weaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Mechanism Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; The shift was linked to reduced activity of ERα-expressing neurons in the preoptic area.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive Experience Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Deleting estrogen receptors in these neurons in virgin females mimicked postpartum behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mothers experience major metabolic adaptations during pregnancy and lactation to support the development and growth of the new life. Although many metabolic changes have been studied, body temperature regulation and environmental temperature preference during and after pregnancy remain poorly understood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and collaborating institutions show in the journal &lt;em&gt;Molecular Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; that postpartum female mice develop new environmental temperature preferences and reveal brain changes mediating these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108242"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and baby." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/postpartum-temperature-brain-neurscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Supporting this finding, the researchers found that virgin females in which the estrogen receptor alpha had been deleted in ERαPOA neurons also preferred lower temperatures and avoided warmer locations, mimicking postpartum females. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In both humans and mice, body temperature increases during early pregnancy, drops to normal temperature during late pregnancy and then goes up again during lactation,” said co-corresponding author Dr. Chunmei Wang, assistant professor of pediatrics at USDA/ARS Children’s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Wang and her colleagues investigated what changes occurred in the brain that mediated the new temperature preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We worked with mice and found that female mice prefer a cooler environment starting from late pregnancy and persisting in long-term postpartum,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For more than four weeks post-weaning female mice had a lower body temperature and preferred cooler environments; they lost their typical preference for warm environments (30 &lt;a&gt;°&lt;/a&gt;C/86 °F) but still avoided cold environments (15 °C/59 °F).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the biological underpinnings of these changes, the researchers studied the preoptic area (POA), a brain region important for sensing and regulating body temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that the change in temperature preference in postpartum female mice was associated with a significant decrease in a particular group of neurons, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-expressing neurons in the preoptic area of the brain (ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons),” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting this finding, the researchers found that virgin females in which the estrogen receptor alpha had been deleted in ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons also preferred lower temperatures and avoided warmer locations, mimicking postpartum females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking closely into the ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, the researchers found that these neurons vary in their ability to sense warm or cold temperatures – one group of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons can directly respond to warmth, while another group responds to cooler temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, compared to female mice that had not been pregnant, ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons of postpartum females had reduced response to warmth and an enhanced response to cold,” Wang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the results support that the ability of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA &lt;/sup&gt;neurons to sense warmth and cold is regulated by reproductive experience and leads to changes in temperature preferences that alter the animal’s warmth-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the researchers are exploring the function of each group of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons on the regulation body temperature and thermal preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to this work include Nan Zhang, Meng Yu, Qianru Zhao, Bing Feng, Yue Deng, Jonathan C.

The number and activity of ERα-expressing POA neurons (ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt;) were assessed using immunohistochemistry and in vitro electrophysiology in response to temperature changes and ERα agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025a"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We showed that female mice prefer a cooler environment starting from late pregnancy and persisting long term postpartum. Female mice with RE (&amp;gt;4 weeks post-weaning) displayed lower body temperature and a lower thermal preferred temperature, and lost preference for warm environments (30 °C) but preserved avoidance of cold environments (15 °C).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was associated with a significant decrease in the number of ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Importantly, virgin female ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt;-KO mice displayed lower thermal preferred temperature and impaired warm preference, mimicking RE mice. We further found that distinct ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; subpopulations can be regulated by temperature changes with or without presynaptic blockers, and by ERα agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, RE decreased the number of warm-activated ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and reduced the excitatory effects of warmth and estrogen-ERα signaling, while cold-activated ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons were slightly enhanced in female mice with RE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030a"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results support that the thermosensing ability and estrogenic effects in ERα&lt;sup&gt;POA&lt;/sup&gt; neurons are regulated by reproductive experience, altering thermal preference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9WeFpHdEdOMXV1TGtTOHNEVXpUWThhUTBXOW41THozQ0wzaGlLODJ5bDk3VXZzN0FMdWFPM0JiNWl6bDNRVEh4Nld3WnFKaTExSXprRHRLbDZEeHYydlMyUlJHU3lGaFlYbmlfbFJRQ1c0UQ</guid></item><item><title>Vaccine skeptic hired to head federal study of immunizations and autism - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNeHd0cUdpVXZra0JMY1FTRFo3SWtWTWFPY190OG9HbE0zTDlyaE8xeDNWZjJuSkhRbzhUejNlMmh1eXlKeXh0U0d6ZEhFeXpJeUZ3bW03Qmt3V01DQkVOQTZWdnZpd3lHc1kyWkM5d09HSmtoQXJVMy02Z19EWUhCSjljTUpkUjN6bVliSmR1WjdQQXBTb3JTSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OLFJMKAJMZHLLC7ATDVDOJ5ACU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A vaccine skeptic who has long promoted false claims about the connection between immunizations and autism has been tapped by the federal government to conduct a critical study of possible links between the two, according to current and former federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NXYZMVKG45AQBHTJ47S2ON4WDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services has hired David Geier to conduct the analysis, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Using advanced MRI scans and blood tests, researchers identified elevated iron in key brain regions and signs of nerve damage in ADHD patients compared to healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers are known precursors to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The findings suggest a potential biological mechanism linking ADHD to a higher risk of dementia later in life, underscoring the importance of early ADHD diagnosis and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron Accumulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with ADHD had increased brain iron in regions associated with cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerve Damage Indicator:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated blood levels of NfL, a marker of axonal damage, were found in ADHD patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The combination of iron buildup and NfL suggests ADHD may increase the risk of age-related dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An adult brain affected by attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity (ADHD) presents modifications similar to those observed in individuals suffering from dementia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the findings of a study conducted by the Geneva University Hospitals (HUG) and the University of Geneva (UNIGE) which shows that, compared with healthy individuals, patients with an ADHD diagnosis have more iron in certain regions of their brain along with higher levels of neurofilaments (NfL) in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These markers have been consistently reported to be characteristic of old age-related dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease and can be measured in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108238"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/adhd-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These results confirm that a link exists between ADHD and an increased risk of dementia at old age and identify first neurological mechanism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirms that ADHD may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life and it provides first evidence for a neurological mechanism possibly involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This significant step forward is described in the journal &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a frequent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 3.5% of adults according to a 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) study. It is characterized by an inability to maintain attention along with inappropriate levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although symptoms generally manifest during childhood and significantly affect educational development and social interactions, its effects can persist and adversely affect daily functioning in adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old age-related dementias affect about 55 million people globally, with almost 10 million new cases each year according to WHO statistics from 2023. Alzheimer’s disease represents 60 to 70% of these dementia cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recent epidemiological studies show that adults suffering from ADHD have an increased risk of dementia at an advanced age, but the mechanism through which ADHD constitutes a risk is not known,” states Professor Paul G. Unschuld, Head of the Division of Geriatric Psychiatry of the HUG, Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine and the initiator of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron and neurofilaments as indicators &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used an advanced brain imaging method, known as quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine iron content in the brain of 32 adults between 25 – 45 years of age affected by ADHD and 29 healthy individuals in the same age bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) levels in the blood of the participants were measured in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study reveal notable differences in iron distribution in several regions of the brain of the individuals affected by ADHD. Furthermore, a significant association was established between iron levels in the precentral cortex and NfL levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron plays an essential role in normal brain functioning, but its excessive accumulation may cause neuronal damage and lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excess iron in certain regions of the brain is often observed and is associated with increased oxidative stress that furthers neuronal degeneration,” specifies Professor Paul Unschuld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the NfL is an indicator of neuronal damage in the brain, more specifically of neuronal axons which are essential for nerve transmission. High blood levels of NfL reflect axon damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, an increased brain iron and NfL levels may indicate an underlying neurodegenerative pathology and an increased risk of neurodegenerative dementia at old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results confirm that a link exists between ADHD and an increased risk of dementia at old age and identify first neurological mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The importance of early detection and management of ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These discoveries pave the way for new research into understanding why persons with ADHD may be at increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Paul Unschuld believes that the information provided by this study “will enable targeted prevention strategies to be developed to reduce the risk of dementia in persons affected by ADHD. This is especially important since there is a well-known correlation between lifestyle and altered iron levels in brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To achieve this, additional longitudinal studies are required in order to determine if a reduction of iron levels in the brain is a potential treatment pathway for preventing dementia at an advanced age in persons with ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the relationship between ADHD and dementia underlines the importance of early detection of these diseases. It also highlights the importance of proactive management of ADHD in adults, not only to improve quality of life for individuals but also to prevent long-term consequences on cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by a SPARK grant awarded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) to Professor Paul G. Unschuld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dementia and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a5b544e5553545f145d4f5f54554e7a4f54535d5f145952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Antoine Guenot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unige.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Geneva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Antoine Guenot – University of Geneva&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pcn.13806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain iron load and neuroaxonal vulnerability in adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt;” by Paul G.

Here, we investigated the liability for neurodegenerative brain disease in adult ADHD, possibly reflected by increased brain iron content and associated neuroaxonal vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-two adults with ADHD (35 ± 10 years) and 29 age- and sex-matched controls (32 ± 12 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), standardized psychometric testing and assessment of lifestyle factors. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to assess magnetic abnormalities indicating local alterations of iron deposition in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By calculating QSM-maps, local iron deposition was tested for statistically significant differences between ADHD and healthy controls. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were measured as an indicator of neuroaxonal integrity by using a fourth-generation ELLA immunoassay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain iron content differed in persons with ADHD, with strongest effects observable in the right precentral cortex (healthy controls: 0.0033 ± 0.0017ppm; ADHD: 0.0048 ± 0.0016ppm; &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;(59) = 3.56, &lt;em&gt;P &amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt; 0.001). Moreover, right precentral cortex iron in persons with ADHD was associated with increased blood NfL levels (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;(1.57) = 13.2, &lt;em&gt;P =&lt;/em&gt; 0.001, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pcn13806-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate altered regional iron content in the brains of adults with ADHD. The observed association between increased precentral magnetic susceptibility and increased NfL suggests a connection between local excess of brain iron and neuroaxonal damage in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the limited sample size of the current study and the naturalistic medication plan, further longitudinal studies are needed to establish whether altered brain iron distribution in adults with ADHD may be associated with an increased risk of dementia at old age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:37:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFB4X0lsdWlJRThhdmVtUVU0ZUdFRUNHazZ2UDYxZE5uQm5pSDFTU1VSTDg2ejlqYUlGUmp6Nk9kZkxDVVI4LU52UUpyeDZSNXJRQTljVXlaaXNxTFNWX3VDQ2NIdVNaLVVWa0RuY0ZYOA</guid></item><item><title>Measles vaccine: Can young children get an early dose of the MMR shot? - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYnFQMnFvZ3pCVERWV2ZMVG80TlNYU0Q0eG1Ycm1GSVpScDRFcVFWU3E5X0VrRndfYjdnckFmcnJKZHdyYXJwa0c3WHpXZzl0SWJpUFIxamVhMEtjSzFFcG8tNHZGM0JqSzdYV3BrbzE1dFNoV2xVWWxRQ05Zb3hFZXRlMnhjZTBrV2sxX0phYVhNTUo5cEQzSHlxNE1JdDFaTFV0SmlkZ1ZoZkt3UVlVaUh30gFWQVVfeXFMTXFUdkgtajVuXzA1RGVBQ19BakxCaVZ2VnhfRnVhVmVYMUM0LWN0VWdxUG1sZzZCai15QzZBU0R3d3BPeElTMEpwMVVkalZFVWtTSGpjLVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-worried-getting-worse-texas-measles-outbreak-grows-families-resist-va-rcna196873" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in the first three months of 2025 than in all of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the 420-plus cases have been centered around the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;West Texas&lt;/a&gt; outbreak, which has spilled over to neighboring &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/ok-measles-update.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;. Other cases in people returning from travel abroad have been reported in a handful of states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vaccination is the best way to protect against infection, but the first dose of the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/childhood-vaccines-adults-booster-shots-measles-texas-what-know-rcna193197" target="_blank"&gt;measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; usually isn’t given until a child is 12 to 15 months old. A second dose is given from ages 4 to 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That schedule leaves children under 1 vulnerable. Some parents, however, are opting to give their young children a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pediatricians-walk-delicate-line-parents-measles-vaccination-debate-rcna194226" target="_blank"&gt;dose of the vaccine ahead of schedule&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock — an epicenter of the current outbreak — said that parents are calling to request an early dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’ve almost doubled the amount of vaccine we administer on a typical month,” Montanez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20the%20routine,elapsed%20since%20the%20first%20dose).&amp;amp;text=There%20are%20no%20recommendations%20to,MMR%20vaccine%20during%20measles%20outbreaks." target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Protecting-Your-Baby-from-a-Measles-Outbreak-FAQs.aspx#measles-travel-baby" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; say that, in the case of an outbreak or international travel, children as young as 6 months can get a dose of the vaccine, and children under 4 years old who have gotten one dose can get their second one earlier. All doses must be separated by at least four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Shilpa Patel, a pediatrician at New Jersey Hackensack Meridian Health Medical Group Northern Valley Pediatrics, said that an early dose before 12 months is essentially a bonus dose, and doesn’t take the place of either of the two standard doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It does not count for the total,” Patel said. “You still need two doses after the age of 12 months.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Montanez said that’s because, “at this age of development, their immune system isn’t quite developed to where the vaccine would provide prolonged or lifelong immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Therefore, we would have to give another dose at a year and essentially a third dose at 4 to 6 years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While early doses are typically recommended when traveling abroad with children, Patel said she’s also starting to recommend the vaccine for kids traveling to some parts of the U.S., including Texas and Disney World in Florida. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/measles-outbreak/measles-outbreak-traced-disneyland-declared-over-n343686" target="_blank"&gt;Theme parks&lt;/a&gt; have been the sites of measles outbreaks in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Don Gibson, 36, and his wife considered early vaccinations for their two sons, now ages 2 years and 4 months, as they prepared&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in January to travel from California to Texas for an April wedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We were really excited to go, and they invited our kids, too, so we were going to take the whole family, but, then, after we booked our travel, including lodging, flights, we saw the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak happening in Texas&lt;/a&gt;,” Gibson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This prompted a conversation with the family pediatrician, who said they could give an early second dose for their 2-year-old and a dose for the infant when he&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;reached 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The wedding, however, would occur before the infant hit 6 months, and ultimately the family decided to cancel their plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Patel said that she’s even started offering an early dose to families who aren’t traveling, but who are concerned about rising measles counts in their neighborhood, pointing to the &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;three measles cases&lt;/a&gt; recently identified in her home state, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For now, doses for domestic travel and for patients in places without active outbreaks are being given at the discretion of individual doctors and parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7146a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;no official recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling domestically to places experiencing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some are calling for changing that to include a flexible third dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In an article earlier this month in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831828" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;, former CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky and several other experts proposed codifying an extra dose for high-risk domestic travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Montanez noted that it’s unclear whether insurance will cover an extra dose of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She said that 80% of her patients are on Medicaid and have their regular immunizations covered by the Texas Vaccines for Children program. But, because these particular doses are given outside of the standard schedule, it remains unclear whether they will be reimbursed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ultimately, the extra dose is the parents’ choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“If you decide you want to do this, you are welcome to,” Montanez said. “If you don’t want to do this, you don’t have to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 21:27:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQYnFQMnFvZ3pCVERWV2ZMVG80TlNYU0Q0eG1Ycm1GSVpScDRFcVFWU3E5X0VrRndfYjdnckFmcnJKZHdyYXJwa0c3WHpXZzl0SWJpUFIxamVhMEtjSzFFcG8tNHZGM0JqSzdYV3BrbzE1dFNoV2xVWWxRQ05Zb3hFZXRlMnhjZTBrV2sxX0phYVhNTUo5cEQzSHlxNE1JdDFaTFV0SmlkZ1ZoZkt3UVlVaUh30gFWQVVfeXFMTXFUdkgtajVuXzA1RGVBQ19BakxCaVZ2VnhfRnVhVmVYMUM0LWN0VWdxUG1sZzZCai15QzZBU0R3d3BPeElTMEpwMVVkalZFVWtTSGpjLVE</guid></item><item><title>For Some Measles Patients, Vitamin A Remedy Supported by RFK Jr. Leaves Them More Ill - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5WN3RzNzZZNlF0QkE3QzQwOGktWU5yR2RZemZ6VllWUUI3TV9nTEtCQm9Dc2RYYkkwcWRFaHl6RUNLbkRYS0dBNUZXaEhLTjJTa0syUzdLWGNGcDRScFl0VWl0S1pCbkZNclJPZHYtc0wzVTYzWVpBMUYwN0M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors in West Texas are seeing measles patients whose illnesses have been complicated by an alternative therapy endorsed by vaccine skeptics including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Parents in Gaines County, Texas, the center of a raging measles outbreak, have increasingly turned to supplements and unproven treatments to protect their children, many of whom are unvaccinated, against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;One of those supplements is vitamin A, which Mr. Kennedy has promoted as a near miraculous cure for measles. Physicians at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, say they’ve now treated a handful of children who were given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some of them had received unsafe doses of supplements for several weeks in an attempt to prevent a measles infection, said Dr. Summer Davies, who cares for acutely ill children at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I had a patient that was only sick a couple of days, four or five days, but had been taking it for like three weeks,” Dr. Davies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While doctors sometimes administer high doses of vitamin A in a hospital to manage severe measles, experts do not recommend taking it without physician supervision.

The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) said today 327 cases have been identified since late January, an increase of 18 cases since late last week.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Only 2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; patients in the Texas outbreak were fully vaccinated for measles, while 325 were unvaccinated against the highly contagious virus, or their vaccine status is unknown.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far 40 people have been hospitalized in the Texas outbreak, and 1 unvaccinated child has died from her infection. Gaines County is the epicenter of the outbreak, with 226 cases reported. Fifteen counties in Texas have reported cases.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighboring New Mexico added 1 more measles case to its outbreak total, which now stands at 43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is primarily a disease of people who are not immunized, and most residents in the outbreak area are protected from measles disease even if they are exposed to the virus. We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas," New Mexico Health said on &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;its website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; We expect to continue to identify new measles infections associated with this regional outbreak in New Mexico and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico's outbreak has been contained in Lea and Eddy counties.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma also has&lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 9 measles cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; linked to the West Texas outbreak, 7 confirmed and 2 probable.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cases up 5.5-fold in Americas region&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) posted a rapid risk assessment on measles in the Americas. PAHO said the overall risk in countries with low vaccine coverage is high, and that cases have risen 5.5-fold compared to the same time period in 2024.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/2025-mar-24-phe-risk-assessment-measles-final.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;From January 1 to March 15&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of this year, 507 measles cases were confirmed in the Americas region, compared to 91 cases reported in the same period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four countries reporting the most cases are the United States (301 as of March 15; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;now 378&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Canada (173 cases), Mexico (22), and Argentina (11).&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She has survived 180 rounds of chemo and seven surgeries &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rates of colorectal cancer in Americans under 50 have risen over the past two decades. This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has changed from 50 when Ms Comer was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc7news.com/post/screen-early-bay-area-woman-stage-4-colon-cancer-shares-dire-message-colorectal-awareness-month/16076982/#:~:text=%22I%20was%20told%20that%20I,during%20an%20interview%20in%202023."&gt;ABC 7 News&lt;/a&gt; if the recommended colon cancer screening age had been moved just a few years earlier, 'I would have been inconvenienced for maybe 18 months, but it would not have been a death sentence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c28441d0-08ac-11f0-a088-dfe2cc6ff8d4" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes 19,550 cases and 3,750 deaths in under-50s.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2030, colon cancer is estimated to be the biggest cancer killer in patients under 50. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are still largely unsure what's behind the epidemic, but obesity, diets high in processed meats and sugar, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental exposures like microplastics and antibiotics are several of the top theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While bloody stool, abdominal pain, weight loss, and changes in bowel habits are tell-tale signs of colon cancer, Ms Comer had no symptoms leading up to her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the only sign of trouble was elevated liver enzymes during a blood test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver enzymes are proteins that help the liver produce and break down bile and rid the body of toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer that has spread to the liver damages protective cells and can lead to excess enzymes flooding into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer told ABC 7 News that following her diagnosis, she would spend eight to 11 hours three days every other week in doing chemotherapy treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also underwent seven surgeries to remove the tumors from her liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after 180 rounds of chemotherapy and between 60 and 70 scans, Ms Comer made the decision to stop treatment and enter hospice care at home this year due to the lasting wear and tear from chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'It wasn't a difficult decision. There were no treatment options that were working and the chemo was making me sicker so I couldn't recover.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Comer, pictured here with her husband and daughter, is now in hospice care and focusing on encouraging young patients to get screened for colon cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said that over the years, her advice to young people and doctors has stayed the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm really a pain in the butt. I keep saying the same thing - screen early,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45. Prior to 2021, this began at age 50, making Ms Comer miss the age requirement to catch her cancer before it spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Comer said: 'To the problem in your life, you are the answer and you are the solution. You have to figure it out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though she is no longer seeking treatment, she noted her husband and 17-year-old daughter have helped keep her from giving up on life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Who would want to leave, who would want to leave this beautiful world with all this kindness?' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 20:22:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPaEdLdkE3eHZFOV9BdkZiZXdKdUJvaXVRU0pDQ0ZKSXc0UkcxeVdndmduMEZJUUR1Umx0YlN6dGdqRmVselVXVHpGLTQtVXhCTlY2d29kamN0STZvcXU5Y1p6ZERsVWpYc2k3LVpQRTR4aGRQTHE4MTBIWXZCRlJscjdSZ2Z6WGtMVVRkWC11c3NzUnlnMUZ5SElRR2V1TWFG0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5kdF9YR1lFZmxmX2p3UGZiZkhtWmFORGQtV3BVSVFTazRka2xrSDJMLVZqa0VjcmxrdWxoUmJPckFoT1p3VkJZQ0ZqRVVRU1JaSWtudk1FSHpDaTE2ZFVqcnU5a3FqWG9oQ3JYdnVsTmVHaVM1a3RFSkJhdHhPWjA5aV84QW83cFkxUXpvc2lBNUVxLURLdnVfNnNMV3RBYjZXTzNLMkE</guid></item><item><title>World First on Bird Flu: A Sheep Tests Positive - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQalV5TDFVQUliV0dOeXRVVzlCVEJCVTYxd0Y4SkR4dERxb3dzYk10bTVVVDBtU3VwTzBBZ3czbnZLellhMHpTLWtlOTUzek9va05XYUlHbHhLZnV4RlFtblF6UGJSTVVuZVc5dUhMUnI3Sms2dnhZYktUVi1SS0V3YVlpSGNEbFhhN2c0RVFsdjM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        We can add one more animal to the list of those known to have contracted bird flu: sheep. Health officials in Britain say the virus turned up in a single sheep on a farm in an undisclosed location, reports the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w1jj0jzl2o?utm_source=join1440&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_placement=newsletter&amp;amp;user_id=66c4c321600ae150759254c4"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. Avian flu, aka H5N1, had previously been reported in a wide range of animals beyond birds, including &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/365898/amid-more-cat-deaths-another-pet-food-recall.html"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/363806/2nd-form-of-bird-flu-spreads-to-cows.html"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt;, pigs, foxes, and &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/364066/new-strain-of-bird-flu-detected-in-a-human.html"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, but this appears to be the first time for a sheep anywhere in the world, notes the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/world/europe/bird-flu-sheep-england.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The best guess is that the sheep, which was euthanized after testing positive, came into contact with infected poultry or their droppings.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                        "In this instance sheep and poultry have mixed on the same farm, resulting in the transmission of avian influenza," said Phil Stocker of Britain's National Sheep Association, adding that the development may lead to new farming practices to keep animals better separated. Health officials continue to emphasize that it remains relatively difficult for the virus to spread to people, notes &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-the-worlds-first-case-of-bird-flu-in-sheep-means-for-the-viruss-spread/"&gt;Scientific American&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="USDA" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, one medium banana has about 105 calories, 27 carbs, 14 grams of sugar, 5 grams of fiber, and 422 mg of potassium. It's also a good source of other nutrients like vitamin C and vitamin B6 and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/what-are-electrolytes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/food-news/what-are-electrolytes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="electrolytes" data-node-id="5.3" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;, including magnesium, sodium, and potassium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"It is estimated that 90% of Americans are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/roasted-vegetable-recipes/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/roasted-vegetable-recipes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="vegetables" data-node-id="6.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; every day," Manaker says. "So, if someone wants to eat a banana every day, that can be a great habit to get into to get some fruit servings in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="potential-downsides-of-bananas" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;Potential Downsides Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But bananas might not be the ideal pick for everyone. Manaker says they might not be the best choice for those following a low-potassium diet or those who get elevated blood sugar after eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Bananas contain carbohydrates and sugars, which raises questions about whether they're a healthy food for people with diabetes. However, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, bananas contain resistant starch, similar to fiber, and release less glucose into the bloodstream than non-resistant starches, like white bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In addition to their carb content, bananas are known for their potassium, an important electrolyte vital to cell and muscle function and heart health. Potassium and sodium work together and need to be in balance. Hyperkalemia occurs when your blood potassium levels are too high, although this condition is rare. Medical experts estimate that only 2% to 3% of people have high potassium levels, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-1i7jlb0 emevuu60"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br data-node-id="10.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;"For a generally healthy person, it is unlikely to experience hyperkalemia by eating one banana a day, especially if the rest of their diet isn't excessively high in potassium-rich foods," Manaker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-bottom-line" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1iyazm5 emevuu60"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;So yes, a banana a day is most likely safe. But this depends on your individual health and diet. Overall, Manaker recommends people eat a variety of fruits and veggies. "While eating a banana every day isn't bad for many people, it may be more beneficial to eat different fruits, with bananas sprinkled into the rotation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;She adds that the amount of bananas someone can eat in a day depends on the rest of their daily diet. For someone with a stomach bug who can only stomach bananas, she said that having more than one is likely acceptable. But it's probably not the best idea for those eating many bananas on top of "mass quantities" of carbohydrate-rich foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As they say, too much of anything—even fruits—can have its downsides, so it's best to aim for a balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Tired of plain old bananas?

But within a few weeks of taking creatine daily, Taft clocked a benefit that she hadn’t anticipated: a cognitive one. “In addition to strength building, creatine has been really helpful with lifting my brain fog,” she says. The best evidence of that, she adds, may be that she remembers to take it every day. Taft’s experience reflects a broader shift in creatine’s target audience. Once a word rarely heard uttered outside of powerlifting circles, nowadays creatine is attracting new interest among women—and middle-aged women at that. According to doctors, it’s for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="1" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;What is creatine, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine is a natural compound that our bodies make using three amino acids (arginine, glycine, and methionine), says Banafsheh Bayati, MD, a board-certified ob-gyn and medical cofounder of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1583755&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fperelelhealth.com%2F%3Futm_channel%3Dpaid_search%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dpmax%26utm_campaign%3Dbrand%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://perelelhealth.com/?utm_channel=paid_search&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Perelel Health" data-vars-ga-product-id="ee6be9a7-8459-4e1b-8219-b7ec728a143e" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="2.1" data-href="https://perelelhealth.com/?utm_channel=paid_search&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-product-url="https://perelelhealth.com/?utm_channel=paid_search&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=pmax&amp;amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-affiliate="true" data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1583755&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fperelelhealth.com%2F%3Futm_channel%3Dpaid_search%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dpmax%26utm_campaign%3Dbrand%26gad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwytS-BhCKARIsAMGJyzqG2r3H_n6EFnl1EmqIPgULQvzyCXbCbqyARfUHCecQH8REHJ_-Z-waAvRDEALw_wcB" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/_p/afflink/swxB/perelelhealth-perelel-doctor-made-vitamins-for","site_id":"10a25939-3448-4c42-8343-9bfdfc32076b","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-price="$0.00" data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id="9bb6b777-4fb0-4ed4-b95d-fcf0c3f0ded5" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="body-link product-links css-1kl271g e1aq0z090"&gt;Perelel Health&lt;/a&gt;. “Its main job is to help make ATP [the body’s main source of energy] in muscle and brain tissue,” Bayati explains. Creatine is produced in your liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and the majority of it (around 95 percent) is stored in our skeletal muscles, says Stacey Ellery, PhD, a pregnancy physiologist and research group head of biogenetics in reproduction at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia. But while the body may naturally produce creatine, that amount covers only a portion of what your muscles use, particularly if you’re active or working on building them, says board-certified ob-gyn &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/drmaryclaire/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/drmaryclaire/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mary Claire Haver, MD" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Mary Claire Haver, MD&lt;/a&gt;. And though creatine is also found in animal-based foods like red meat, poultry, and fish, for your body (and brain) to really reap the benefits, you’d need to eat a few pounds a day. Hence: supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="3" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;How creatine helps muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In the ’90s, supplementing with creatine rose to popularity among the body-building masses, as did the first wave of scientific studies supporting its ability to bolster muscle mass. How does it do it? “Creatine phosphate stored in muscles is responsible for supplying energy for quick anaerobic bouts of muscle contraction,” says Heather A. Milton, an exercise physiologist supervisor at NYU Langone Health. We use those CP stores within 10 to 30 seconds, she adds, so the higher the stores we have in the muscles, the more our energy output. “This means creatine provides more capacity to lift a heavier load and withstand fatigue while doing so, and that increased strength of work produces greater muscle growth,” says Milton. So you’re able to train harder, lift heavier, and, crucially, recover faster, because creatine is key both for muscle metabolism and muscle repair.  But it’s important to remember that taking creatine alone won’t magically grow your muscles. “It’s the increased capacity to train that most people experience when taking creatine that results in increased muscle mass and exercise performance,” says Ellery.&lt;br data-node-id="4.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="6" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;How the rest of your body may benefit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While the research on creatine and muscle is long-standing and robust, newer research points to additional benefits. One area is the brain, which makes sense, considering that the brain relies on ample amounts of ATP (which, as a reminder, creatine helps create) to function. “When creatine stores are low, brain cells may have a harder time keeping up with the energy demands of thinking, processing, information, and managing stress,” says Haver.

This is why creatine levels fluctuate with your menstrual cycle and other hormonal changes, like the drop in estrogen during menopause. Not to mention that key players in the reproductive process (sperm, uterus, placenta, and fetus) rely on creatine as a source of cellular energy. “Observational studies suggest that in some cases, low creatine levels are associated with fertility complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes,” says Ellery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="10" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;Why women in midlife may be the biggest winners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine is not a one-size-fits-all recommendation for every woman hovering around midlife. But most doctors agree that, besides vegans and vegetarians (who noticeably lack it in their diets), middle-aged women stand to benefit from it because it can help mitigate the loss of muscle and bone mass, as well as the brain fog that is common in perimenopause. The fact that creatine not only increases exercise performance but also specifically targets changes in energy metabolism, inflammation, and oxidative stress associated with insufficient estrogen is huge for women in midlife, says Ellery. She adds that creatine is also fast becoming a therapeutic intervention of interest for diseases more prevalent in female populations, such autoimmune and major depressive disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;For Veerle Arts, a 39-year-old strength and mobility coach and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.breuckelenathletic.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.breuckelenathletic.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Breuckelen Athletic" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Breuckelen Athletic&lt;/a&gt; in Brooklyn, New York, a podcast interview with &lt;a href="https://www.drstacysims.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.drstacysims.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stacy Sims" data-node-id="12.3" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Stacy Sims&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, talking about creatine in the context of women’s health and performance benefits first piqued her curiosity. “After taking it for four weeks, I began to notice that I could scale up my workouts and sustain a higher intensity. Around the six-week mark, I felt clearer, like my brain fog had lifted. And two months in, I had noticeably put on more muscle,” says Arts, adding that she has been taking it for 10 months and has no plans to stop. “Most of my female clients over 40 are either considering creatine or already taking it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="13" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1eiql25 e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-2xuljx eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-40esvh e1pe3zr90"&gt;Around the six-week mark, I felt clearer, like my brain fog had lifted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-15j1ztq eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-6lrfhd emevuu60"&gt;Are these supplements safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Creatine’s use as a dietary supplement has been studied for decades, and it is widely regarded as safe. In the ’90s, it got some negative press due to a case study linking it to kidney injury, says Ellery. But that study has since been debunked and superseded by thorough safety reviews. (Still, people with kidney issues should check with their doctors before taking the supplement.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Because the supplement market is wildly and widely unregulated, paying attention to source and quality are key, says Milton. Creatine monohydrate is the gold standard, says Haver—specifically products that are third-party tested (like those certified by the &lt;a href="https://cleanlabelproject.org" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://cleanlabelproject.org" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clean Label Project" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-1kl271g emevuu60"&gt;Clean Label Project&lt;/a&gt;) for purity, potency, and contaminants. The clinically effective dose that doctors usually recommend is 3 to 5 grams a day, though people who are keen to saturate their muscles faster, says Haver, will sometimes “creatine load,” which involves taking a higher dose (20 grams per day, split into four doses) for five to seven days. “But that isn’t necessary, especially if you’re in this for long-term health and maintenance.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Consistency matters more than anything else, and, as with any supplement, it’s important to note that there is a range of responsiveness: Some people experience mild side effects like water retention or gastrointestinal upset, and some people experience a benefit while others don’t.  Additionally, many doctors recommend taking it for up to five years, since its effects beyond that time frame are not well documented. The bottom line? For women eager to shore up their mental and physical strength in midlife, it may be worth trying.&lt;br data-node-id="17.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="body-tip css-tax92z emevuu60"&gt;Any content published by Oprah Daily is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The breakfast staple is an excellent addition to &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/how-to-make-a-smoothie/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoothies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, hearty oatmeal, or, on its own, slathered in peanut butter. And, as a fruit with natural packaging, it's easy to carry on the go for a quick snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We've all heard the saying, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." For many, the versatile fruit is a regular part of the daily diet. But just how healthy is it to eat a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/best-banana-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt; every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian nutritionist, shares her insight on everything we need to know about eating bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Health Benefits Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, let's get to the nutrition. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173944/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, one medium banana has about 105 calories, 27 carbs, 14 grams of sugar, 5 grams of fiber, and 422 mg of potassium. It's also a good source of other nutrients like vitamin C and vitamin B6 and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/what-are-electrolytes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:electrolytes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;electrolytes&lt;/a&gt;, including magnesium, sodium, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It is estimated that 90% of Americans are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/christmas/roasted-vegetable-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vegetables;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vegetables&lt;/a&gt; every day," Manaker says. "So, if someone wants to eat a banana every day, that can be a great habit to get into to get some fruit servings in."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Potential Downsides Of Bananas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But bananas might not be the ideal pick for everyone. Manaker says they might not be the best choice for those following a low-potassium diet or those who get elevated blood sugar after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bananas contain carbohydrates and sugars, which raises questions about whether they're a healthy food for people with diabetes. However, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;, bananas contain resistant starch, similar to fiber, and release less glucose into the bloodstream than non-resistant starches, like white bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition to their carb content, bananas are known for their potassium, an important electrolyte vital to cell and muscle function and heart health. Potassium and sodium work together and need to be in balance. Hyperkalemia occurs when your blood potassium levels are too high, although this condition is rare. Medical experts estimate that only 2% to 3% of people have high potassium levels, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15184-hyperkalemia-high-blood-potassium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For a generally healthy person, it is unlikely to experience hyperkalemia by eating one banana a day, especially if the rest of their diet isn't excessively high in potassium-rich foods," Manaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So yes, a banana a day is most likely safe. But this depends on your individual health and diet. Overall, Manaker recommends people eat a variety of fruits and veggies. "While eating a banana every day isn't bad for many people, it may be more beneficial to eat different fruits, with bananas sprinkled into the rotation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She adds that the amount of bananas someone can eat in a day depends on the rest of their daily diet. For someone with a stomach bug who can only stomach bananas, she said that having more than one is likely acceptable. But it's probably not the best idea for those eating many bananas on top of "mass quantities" of carbohydrate-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As they say, too much of anything—even fruits—can have its downsides, so it's best to aim for a balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tired of plain old bananas? Put your produce to use with a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/healthy-peanut-butter-banana-smoothie-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:peanut butter banana smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;peanut butter banana smoothie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/banana-nut-bread-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:banana nut bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;banana nut bread&lt;/a&gt; (to use up those super ripe ones).

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are dozens of canned soup options to choose from at the supermarket, including plant-based picks and traditional types with differing fat and sodium content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When shopping for a healthy canned soup, look for one with 300 to 600 milligrams of sodium per serving, zero trans fat or added sugars, and no more than four grams of saturated fat per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using those guidelines, some of the healthiest canned soups you can buy at the supermarket include Amy’s Organic Lentil Soup Light in Sodium and Cedarlane Foods Organic Vegetable &amp;amp; Barley Soup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re looking for a quick lunch or dinner, nothing beats a savory can of soup. These quick conveniences often elicit nostalgic, comforting, and delicious childhood memories. But nowadays there are many more canned soup options to choose from. In fact, pretty much any soup you can think of is available for purchase in a can.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while majority of these shelf-stable soups are undoubtedly tasty, many of them contain ingredients that take away from their overall healthfulness.The yummiest soup varieties tend to boast high levels of sodium, fat, preservatives, and even added sugars, making them a little less alluring for the health-conscious community.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, there’s now plenty of healthy canned soups to choose from at &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/americas-most-popular-grocery-store-right-now-8774580" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;many grocery stores&lt;/a&gt; nationwide.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to sussing out healthier canned soup options, the main nutrients and ingredients we want to be wary of are &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-foods-high-in-sodium-7564072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;, saturated and trans fat, added sugars, additives, and preservatives.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned soup is one of the most notorious sources of sodium (aka salt) as it adds to the product’s overall taste and shelf life. But long-term excessive sodium consumption can lead to hypertension (or high blood pressure levels)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and increase one’s risk for developing heart disease. “A good soup choice will have between 300 and 600 milligrams (milligrams) of sodium per serving. Just remember that one serving is usually just half of the can, so if you’ll be having both servings (which most people do), don’t forget to double the sodium,” says Rachel Gargano, MS, RD, CSSD, CBS, chief registered dietitian at Live it Up. These guidelines help you to stay within nationally-recognized limits. “The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting sodium intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams a day&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (though ideally no more than 1,500 milligrams per day for most adults),” says Jamie Adams, MS, RDN, RPYT, women’s health dietitian and founder and owner of Mamaste Nutrition.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Speaking of heart disease, trans and saturated fats are other nutrients we want to be on lookout for. Trans fat, also known as hydrogenated fat, increases LDL (low-density lipoprotein or ‘bad’) &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/worst-foods-for-high-cholesterol" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; while decreasing HDL (high-density lipoprotein or ‘good’) cholesterol levels, delivering a one-two punch to heart health and increasing cardiovascular disease risk&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The healthiest canned soup will have zero grams of trans fat and no ‘hydrogenated’ ingredients on the ingredients list. Saturated fat (though more controversial&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) is also generally accepted as a cholesterol-raising nutrient as well,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and is best limited when heart health is the priority. The AHA recommends keeping saturated fat intake to less than six percent of your total daily calories&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. So if you’re following a 2,000 calorie diet, that would be about 13 grams total. Look for soup options with no more than four grams of saturated fat per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additives, preservatives, and added sugars&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are also ingredients to avoid in canned soup. This is because mystery ingredients like additives and preservatives lack the long-term evidence to fully evaluate their health effects&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (though they’re technically deemed safe for consumption). Meanwhile, added sugar is a major &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/sugar-inflammation" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pro-inflammatory agent&lt;/a&gt; in the diet&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and can contribute to chronic disease development&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and insulin resistance&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. “Some soups, particularly tomato-based varieties, may contain higher amounts of added sugars which only provide empty calories,” says Adams. The healthiest soups will mainly contain ingredients you recognize and have no added sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Better-for-you canned soups will be filled with health-boosting nutrients, like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-sources-of-protein-8775868" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, too. “Ensuring you have enough protein and fiber at the meal will help you get enough nutrition and feel satisfied. Some soups don’t have enough of these macronutrients, which means you may be more likely to feel hungry sooner,” says Gargano. These nutrients also promote muscle and tissue growth and repair, as well as gut and metabolic health. Protein can be found in lean meats, fish, poultry, dairy, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/ways-to-use-up-extra-eggs-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt;, nuts, seeds, and legumes, whereas fiber is most concentrated in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/healthiest-grains" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;, veggies, legumes, nuts, and seeds. “Look for soups higher in protein (at least five to seven grams per serving) and fiber (three plus grams per serving) for a more nutritionally balanced soup that leaves you feeling full and satisfied,” Adams adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Unsaturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds are other nutrients you want to see in a canned soup. Unsaturated fats offer satiating benefits while also working to lower cholesterol levels and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-foods-11684448" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; throughout the body. Micronutrients like vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds support several important body systems like the gut, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, heart, brain, skin, hair, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-stronger-longer-nails-9588978" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;nails&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Sources of these nutrients include whole grains, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-nuts-to-eat-11686130" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, seeds, legumes, vegetables, and healthy oils (like olive or avocado), and you want to choose a soup with as many of these ingredients as you can find.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-healthiest-canned-soup-varieties"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Healthiest Canned Soup Varieties  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With these guidelines in mind, let’s dive into six of the healthiest canned soup varieties:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Lentil Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a super-satisfying dish full of protein, fiber, plant compounds, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-a-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; (which together support gut, heart, immune, metabolic, and eye health), look no further than lentil soup. “Lentil soup tends to have a bit more protein than other bean-based soups,” Gargano agrees, meaning you’ll feel plenty full after enjoying it. Amy’s Organic Lentil Soup Light in Sodium has nine grams of protein, six grams of fiber, and a total of 460 milligrams of sodium.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Minestrone Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Minestrone warms you from the inside out with its rich tomato broth filled with an array of vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/bean-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt;, and pasta. These ingredients provide plenty of protein, fiber, and micronutrients for a balanced and filling meal. “Soups such as minestrone usually have at least three grams of fiber per serving, and bring with them the excellent health benefits of beans and legumes,” says Gargano. Health Valley Organic Minestrone Soup is made with organic veggies and spices, and provides seven grams of protein, six grams of fiber, and only 32 milligrams of sodium per serving. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Tomato Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Few soups are as American as tomato soup, often conjuring up childhood memories of gooey &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/grilled-cheese-secret-ingredient" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grilled cheese dipping&lt;/a&gt;. And thankfully, this soup can be plenty healthy as a meaningful source of fiber, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/vitamin-c-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin A, and lycopene&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;—a powerful plant compound that benefits eye, immune, and gut health&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, many tomato soups are sneaky sources of added sugars, so it’s important to check the ingredients list prior to making a purchase. Sprague Tomato Bisque with Roasted Red Peppers is a fantastic grab that meets our criteria, though is a little low in protein. “If you love a soup that has enough fiber, is low in sodium, but not enough protein (like tomato soup), you can add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/quick-easy/leftover-chicken-recipes" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;leftover chicken&lt;/a&gt;, low-sodium canned chicken, or extra beans to it for a boost,” Gargano shares.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Chicken and Vegetable Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though chicken noodle soup is a comforting classic, it lacks the robust vegetable content needed to earn a spot on this list. Chicken and vegetable soup meets this criteria, however, providing plenty of protein, fiber, energy-boosting B vitamins, and immune-supportive plant compounds. “Pacific Foods Organic Chicken and Wild Rice Soup is one example made with organic chicken and veggies, and this soup provides you with 12 grams of protein and four grams of fiber per serving,” says Adams. While this option is just 40 milligrams over the recommended sodium guidelines, you can mix in a touch of water while warming it up to mitigate this.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Split Pea Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A close relative to lentil, split pea is equally satisfying with its impressive fiber, protein, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-iron-8702307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, B vitamins, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; content to benefit immune, bone, blood, gut, heart, and metabolic health. “This soup provides plenty of fiber and vegetables—things that most Americans fall short of every day,” Gargano adds. Amy's Organic Light in Sodium Split Pea Soup is made with organic vegetables and provides 12 grams of protein, seven grams of fiber, and 510 milligrams of sodium per serving with no added sugars. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Vegetable Barley Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And our final healthy canned soup to highlight is vegetable barley. This &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/vegetable-soup-recipes-7187500" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian soup&lt;/a&gt; is rich in fiber with its high vegetable content, and features an often-forgotten (but super nutritious) ingredient—barley! Barley is an excellent source of protein, fiber, potassium, iron, magnesium, B vitamins, selenium, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-zinc-7511268" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, copper, and manganese&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, championing heart, gut, immune, metabolic, and bone health. Cedarlane Foods Organic Vegetable &amp;amp; Barley Soup is a tasty organic option with less than 500 milligrams of sodium per serving, and it serves as the perfect palette for protein-rich add-ins.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-healthy-canned-soup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look for in Healthy Canned Soup &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the above varieties are fantastic soups to start with, there are many other healthy canned soup options to be discovered in the canned foods aisle. To find them, use the following guidelines:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Choose soups with less than 600 milligrams of sodium per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for options with zero grams of trans fat and no ‘hydrogenated’ ingredients on the label&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opt for soups with ingredients you recognize and can pronounce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose soups with at least five to seven grams of protein per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for fiber content of at least three grams per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aim for soup brands with four grams of saturated fat or less per serving&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select soups with no added sugars&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reach for varieties with plenty of nutrient-dense ingredients like lean meats, fish, poultry, whole grains, legumes, and/or vegetables&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
