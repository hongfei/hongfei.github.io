The latest figures show the disease’s spread continues to accelerate — and indicates that the country is backsliding in keeping children from dying of preventable diseases, said Paul Offit, an infectious-diseases physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who directs its vaccine education center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LHA4Z4LRRRGLVBP263LHBLZ4II" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The jump in whooping cough cases coincides with a worsening national &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/08/trump-measles-vaccine-rfk-jr-response/" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, both driven in part by declining childhood vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LXDAQLCC25GO7A34ERQM2BGI3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You’re already now seeing children die [of whooping cough] in states where you haven’t had a child death in years,” Offit said. “For the same reasons we’re going backward with measles, we’re going backward with pertussis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BMCBR4WCJ5DWNBGBKRV42JISAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People of any age can become ill from pertussis, which creates a thick mucus in the windpipe and makes it hard to breathe. But the disease is especially dangerous for infants, whose airways are smaller and more fragile. Children with pertussis may cough uncontrollably, stop breathing and turn blue; when they inhale through a narrowed windpipe, it makes a whooping sound — hence the name, Offit said. The disease is sometimes called the “100 day cough” because illness can persist for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L4YRI65ZWBEYRB7DTK6PRSVT5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Pertussis will always be with us — even if the entire country were vaccinated, the bacteria would still be circulating,” Offit said. “The purpose of the vaccine is to keep you out of the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LRFMQYRE7BDH3JC67EMPETOESM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Vaccination rates against whooping cough have declined since the coronavirus pandemic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;: In 2023-2024, the vaccination rate among the nation’s kindergartners fell to 92.3 percent, from 94.9 percent four years earlier.

That tends to be long before most parents realize their child is ill, in part because early symptoms, like runny noses and a low-grade fever, are so similar to those of the common cold or RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GLNFNADGN5AZFA5ZJYEHJQXQGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once a person has more severe symptoms, like a persistent cough, antibiotics can only stop the spread of the bacteria to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IEQ6TMZZB5GB3DHOGNRF64UFXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This is where I tell families, your child will be fighting to breathe, and even supportive care will not always save a child from death,” said Singh, who advises people not to delay vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BHE57DMSPNF4PIN7ROLETU5P4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;National and state-level vaccination rates also can conceal a more complex picture at the local level, where diseases can take hold and spread, said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5O3B4EUBKBD75IYG3XN7LJB2EU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In Texas, for example, the 2023-2024 measles vaccination rate for seventh-graders (from schools that responded) was &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;above 94 percent,&lt;/a&gt; according to data from the Texas Department of Health Services; in rural Foard County, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the rate&lt;/a&gt; was just north of 66 percent. At the individual district or school level, the rates vary even more, with one Tarrant County private school showing a measles vaccination rate of 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WDICIHNYAZA23E76CUE3NT4YLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the big challenges is that the infrastructure that is out there to provide not just access to vaccines, but information parents are seeking, has been hit with severe cuts over the past few weeks,” Casalotti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VVFEFCGDBNFGLFHKICRTGNMKHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Among the cuts recently announced by the Trump administration was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/10/vaccines-nih-rfk-research-canceled/" target="_blank"&gt;the elimination or reduction&lt;/a&gt; of grants to researchers who study vaccine hesitancy. Casalotti said the National Association of County and City Health Officials has been asking its members how cuts like those to the CDC and National Institutes of Health have affected their work on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7WK2ZG7M2FGOZMRAVJJUO7XDY4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We’re hearing money is being pulled from mobile clinics, that they have to stop having extended hours for immunizations, that they’re not able to do as much or any communication around immunization,” Casalotti said. “That means parents are left without ways to make decisions for their family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VO3DYLWHWNFQZNG3RQH54RBZF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Offit, the Philadelphia doctor, said the cuts to public health programs and decline in vaccination rates paints a troubling picture for disease control and prevention in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WCDYEKTKARDRDHJG7XGVPQQMBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We’re taking a major step back,” he said. “I think the only way we move forward again is if we hit bottom and people say, ‘This is enough children dying.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 01:51:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNRDBTVmdOb3Y2YllRZzJETGZwVU9EWXVvX1pZZHZUSktPclBMYUZLY0MyVVBNUEUxYlFCekxhMUlzYmsza1lfRXM1VzE3Ymd6YThrR0NjYUFVZFI0QnM1anRndnk1WWVhQS1kZEMtcHlrU0trR1NuY3pCMDc4ejFnQkdoWUJ2RjY3YldPV1hn</guid></item><item><title>在金县确诊的婴儿麻疹病例；今年在华盛顿州排名第5 - KOMO | Infant measles case confirmed in King County; 5th in Washington this year - KOMO</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;KING COUNTY, Wash. — &lt;/span&gt;Public Health—Seattle &amp;amp; King County confirmed another positive measles case in King County on Friday, marking Washington's fifth measles case of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health said the infant traveled through Sea-Tac airport and was present at certain Seattle Children’s Hospital locations while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health also noted the infant was likely exposed to measles during recent international travel, and it had not yet been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant's case is not connected to any of the previously reported cases, according to Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County. Of the now five confirmed measles cases that have been reported, this one is the third reported infant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County said it also responded to two other measles cases this year among people who traveled through King County but are not Washington state residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Measles outbreaks are happening in every part of the world," said Elysia Gonzales, Medical Epidemiologist for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County. "If you are planning international travel, it’s important to speak with your healthcare provider about what vaccines may be needed. Children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health—Seattle &amp;amp; King County said the public may have been exposed to measles at several locations during the infant's infectious period. Potential exposure sites include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on April 15 from 4:50 p.m. to 7:45 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle Children’s Hospital on April 17 from 8:45 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. (Emergency department lobby)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle Children's Hospital on April 17 again from 5:30 to 7:45 p.m. (Forest B level 1 lobby and Forest Pharmacy)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle Children’s Hospital on April 18 from 11:50 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seattle Children’s Hospital on April 20 from 12:05 p.m. to 2:25 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County advises anyone who was at these locations during the specified times to monitor for symptoms and consult a healthcare provider if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected. It mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from about 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and rarely, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can happen even in healthy people, but those at highest risk include: infants and children under 5 years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems from medications or underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing about 97% protection against measles.

Case in point: We rated pecans as the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nut-for-better-blood-sugar-8713351" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;No. 1 nut to eat for better blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers at Pennsylvania State University were curious to learn more about pecans, and they published their findings in 2025 in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, researchers wanted to know how replacing snacks with 57 grams (about ¼ cup) of pecans a day affects certain markers for cardiometabolic diseases in individuals at risk for them. Cardiometabolic diseases include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, to name a few.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After screening 191 individuals, 138 of them were chosen for the study; about 60% were female, with an average age of 46. All participants were free from heart disease and type 2 diabetes, but had at least one risk factor for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-have-metabolic-syndrome-8694742" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;High blood sugar levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low HDL (“good”) cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High triglycerides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Larger waist circumference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were split into two groups: an intervention group, who replaced the snacks they usually ate with pecans (a total of ¼ cup per day), and a control group, who continued with their usual diet while avoiding nuts and nut butters. Participants had certain tests done at baseline and again after the 12-week study period, with strict instructions for what to avoid before the testing. The tests included:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Flow-mediated dilation (FMD), which is a test to see how well blood vessels dilate or relax in response to increased blood flow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), a measure that assesses the stiffness of arteries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lipids/lipoproteins (cholesterol, triglycerides)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glycemic control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, participants also completed three 24-hour recall food diaries throughout the study period—at baseline and weeks 6 and 12. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2020 is a rating tool used to assess diet quality based on the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Higher scores (up to 100) reflect healthier eating patterns. The scores of individual participants were calculated to find an average score for each group. At baseline, both groups’ average HEI-2020 score was about the same, at approximately 56. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though the FMD was the primary test researchers were looking at, there was no difference at the end of 12 weeks between the groups’ FMD scores. Researchers note that this may have been because all of the participants’ FMDs were within normal ranges at baseline, so there wasn’t a need for improvement. They also add that the amount of pecans eaten provided an amount of flavonols (a type of antioxidant) lower than what has been shown in previous studies to improve FMD. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the end of 12 weeks, there were also no medically significant differences between groups regarding HDL (“good”) cholesterol, insulin, HbA1C (average blood glucose level over three months), C-reactive protein (CRP, a measure of inflammation), or waist circumference.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What did change was cholesterol and triglyceride levels—and the change was significant. The pecan group saw a reduction in: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;total cholesterol levels of over 8 points (mg/dL) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LDL cholesterol of over 7 points (mg/dL) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;non-HDL cholesterol (all types of LDL cholesterol plus triglycerides) by 9.5 points (mg/dL)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;triglycerides by over 16 points (mg/dL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, at the end of the 12 weeks, the pecan group’s HEI-2020 score increased by 9.4 points. They also showed an increase in healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and fiber compared to the usual diet group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By the end of the study, the pecan group’s weight had also increased by about 1.5 pounds. While researchers are unsure why this occurred, it’s important to remember that weight can fluctuate by 5 lbs, even from morning to night—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/one-thing-you-shouldnt-do-to-lose-weight-8763929" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;and this is normal&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some limitations of this study include that the dietary information was self-reported, which can have faults if participants don’t accurately remember what they ate. The study authors also state that, due to the number of secondary factors that were examined, statistical errors could have occurred. Finally, it’s important to note that this study was funded by the American Pecan Council, though the authors state that the APC played no role in how the study was conducted or interpreted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that by replacing a “typical” snack with a small handful of pecans each day, you might experience a reduction in harmful cholesterol and triglycerides, and an increase in the quality of your diet. Depending on what your typical snack is, however, you might be able to add the nuts to it. For example, adding nuts to yogurt or a piece of fruit is a great way to balance the nutrition in the snack and make it more satisfying. And if you enjoy a piece of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8013599/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-chocolate-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dark chocolate&lt;/a&gt; in the afternoon, pecans can perfectly complement dark chocolate’s heart-healthy characteristics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We love using pecans in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8031283/blueberry-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Summer Blueberry Salad with Toasted Pecans &amp;amp; Feta&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blueberry-cobbler-energy-balls-8674600" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Blueberry Cobbler Energy Balls&lt;/a&gt;. Or spice them up savory like we did for our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7881849/rosemary-garlic-pecans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Rosemary-Garlic Pecans&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While pecans lowered harmful cholesterol in this study, they didn’t see a difference in the beneficial HDL cholesterol—the type of cholesterol you want to see increase. Had the study been longer, participants may have seen a difference in their HDL, but since it wasn’t, we can’t say for sure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What if you can’t eat pecans due to allergies or some other medical condition, or you simply don’t like them? Thankfully, there are other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/288593/10-foods-that-lower-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods that help raise beneficial cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and lower the bad stuff, including salmon, oatmeal, apples, beans and avocado. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise has also been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommendations-for-high-cholesterol-8715965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;benefit cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; by lowering LDL and increasing HDL cholesterol. Both cardio and resistance training exercises have been linked with improved cholesterol levels, so choose an activity you enjoy and get moving!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that replacing usual snacks with pecans is associated with lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Making this change also increased participants’ healthy eating scores. This goes to show that by making small changes, like replacing your typical snacks with healthier options, you can make a big difference in your health. This may be especially true if you replace nutrient-poor snacks—like a bag of chips or some pieces of candy—with pecans from time to time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pick a health habit to start with—like eating, exercise, getting more sleep or managing your stressors—and begin to gradually integrate the new habit into your life a little bit at a time. Over time, you’ll notice a shift in how you feel, and you may even see better numbers at your next visit to the doctor’s office. Those better numbers could mean lower risk of disease and better quality of life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And who knows? &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/3-habits-aging-study-8787260" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;You might even live longer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

But health officials regard those as separate outbreaks, because they were fueled by multiple introductions of the virus by international travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;C.D.C. officials now view the spread of measles in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico as a single outbreak, Dr. Dan Filardo, who leads the agency’s task force for the measles response, told state health officials at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is the largest outbreak in the U.S. since measles elimination was declared in 2000,” he said.

A new study followed individuals self-administering psychedelics and found that while some experienced lingering visual aftereffects, most were not distressed by them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, delusional ideation slightly decreased a month after use, suggesting that psychedelics may not heighten psychotic traits as once feared. Traits like high sensory absorption and younger age were most associated with persistent visual effects, reinforcing the need for careful screening in clinical and recreational contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Aftereffects:&lt;/strong&gt; About one-third reported lingering visuals like afterimages, but few found them distressing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Delusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Delusional ideation slightly decreased one month after psychedelic use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; High sensory absorption and younger age were strongest predictors of HPPD-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic drugs are seeing a surge of interest from mainstream medicine, and initial results suggest that psychedelic-therapy can be a safe and effective treatment for some mental health conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the side-effect profile is still incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the use of psychedelics has been posited to carry a risk of triggering latent psychotic disorders or persistent visual hallucination, known as Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand the prevalence and risk factors of such side-effects, Katie Zhou and colleagues surveyed 654 people online who were planning to take psychedelics through their own initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those, 315 people were resurveyed two weeks after their experience and 212 people were resurveyed again four weeks after their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample was 74% male, and 77% university educated. About one third had been diagnosed with at least one psychiatric condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors found a weak correlation between lifetime psychedelic use and both delusional ideation and magical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, on average, delusional ideation was slightly reduced one month after psychedelic use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that schizotypal traits may not be caused by taking LSD or magic mushrooms, in keeping with the principle that correlation does not imply causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a third of individuals surveyed at the four-week mark did have some lingering hallucinatory sensory experiences, such as intensified colors and afterimages. However, the majority of those who experienced this did not report being distressed by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest predictors of persistent visual aftereffects were the personality trait absorption—the tendency to be easily immersed in sensory or imaginative experiences—and younger age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This corroborates previous findings showing that young people and adolescents may be at a particular risk of HPPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, empirical scrutiny of the potential risks of psychedelics should accompany changes in policy and access to psychedelic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychedelics and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katie Zhou&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katie Zhou – PNAS Nexus&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prediction of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder and thought disturbance symptoms following psychedelic use&lt;/a&gt;” by Katie Zhou et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction of hallucinogen persisting perception disorder and thought disturbance symptoms following psychedelic use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in using psychedelic drugs to treat psychiatric disorders is growing rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While modern controlled clinical trials show a favorable safety and efficacy profile, it remains unclear if the risk of side effects would increase with broader use in more heterogeneous populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we investigated the frequency and baseline predictors of delusional ideation, magical thinking, and “hallucinogen persisting perception disorder” (HPPD)-related symptoms following psychedelic use in a self-selected naturalistic sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a prospective cohort study, symptoms were assessed in (⁠N=654⁠) participants at one week before a planned psychedelic experience, and at two and four weeks afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the sample, delusional ideation was found to be reduced one month after psychedelic use (⁠P&amp;lt;0.001⁠) with no changes detected in magical thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings were in seeming opposition to positive correlations between lifetime psychedelic use at baseline with magical thinking (⁠rs=0.12⁠, P=0.003⁠) and delusional ideation (⁠rs=0.11⁠, P=0.01⁠), suggesting that schizotypal traits, instead of being caused by, may merely correlate with psychedelic use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, over 30% of the sample reported HPPD-type effects at the 4-week endpoint, although rarely perceived as distressing (&amp;lt; 1% of the population).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger age, female gender, history of a psychiatric diagnosis and baseline trait absorption predicted the occurrence of HPPD-like effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in line with prior studies showing a high prevalence of HPPD-like symptoms in psychedelic users, which, however, appear to remain at a subclinical severity in most cases, explaining the comparatively lower prevalence of HPPD diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 20:38:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE4yanBEZEJaT29oT0twN1NBWk5HbXJkTzA2WVZpMThpSGhHS0ZGcFljZ2otai1yU1h1ajFFbE8xU1lIeFg0dDQxSkNjQ2R0aERyNk53dGkybnY3enVzSS14RWRpTk5QaG9KZktBdmNn</guid></item><item><title>能量饥饿引发大脑中危险的谷氨酸激增-神经科学新闻 | Energy Starvation Triggers Dangerous Glutamate Surges in the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBHWFRWTjQwczNrb29POHRCZTZOdTVjdVVhUHo1b21Fc0Fxd2VPSXd6SkZxZVhwNWRDT1ZoVGdvU2R1S2cydE9GZ0hTVDg2d0czbV8zX1Z5V05sb2hKTWZFWDkzWVgzd0w5UExoU1RLQVQwQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;The brain needs constant energy to function, especially for managing neurotransmitter activity. A new study shows that when energy is depleted—such as during a stroke—neurons begin releasing glutamate in abnormal, self-amplifying bursts that can damage nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a fluorescent sensor, researchers observed long-lasting, localized glutamate events that became more frequent under stress. These findings point to a dangerous feedback loop and highlight how disrupted metabolism leads to excitotoxicity, worsening outcomes in conditions like stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Crisis:&lt;/strong&gt; Energy depletion halts normal glutamate release and triggers abnormal, self-reinforcing surges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxic Cascade:&lt;/strong&gt; Excess extracellular glutamate harms neurons and impairs synaptic function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intervention Clue:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking NMDA receptors significantly reduced harmful glutamate release events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;RUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brain requires a constant supply of energy. A disrupted energy supply, as it is for instance caused by a stroke, can have serious complications. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from the research group Cellular Neurobiology at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, together with researchers from the Universities of Düsseldorf and Twente, investigated how an energy deficiency in the brain affects the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108973"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/glutamate-surge-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Conversely, the researchers were able to significantly reduce this type of glutamate release by inhibiting glutamate receptors, especially by inhibiting the subclass of NMDA receptors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed that under stress abnormal glutamate release events occur that self-amplify and that may thereby contribute to the damage of nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Dr. Tim Ziebarth, report their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;iScience&lt;/em&gt; on April 18, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unusual glutamate releases occur more frequently upon energy depletion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal conditions, brain tissue is sufficiently supplied with energy, which is in part required for the selective release and reuptake of neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, if there is no longer enough energy available, this balance between neurotransmitter release and reuptake can quickly become disrupted,” Tim Ziebarth explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially in the case of strokes, where the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, there is often an extracellular increase in the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, which severely impairs the function of synapses and the survival of the affected nerve cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the underlying processes are only partially understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a model system, Tim Ziebarth observed a previously unknown, unconventional release mechanism that significantly increased the extracellular glutamate concentrations upon energy depletion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his measurements, he used a fluorescent sensor protein, which allowed him to visualize the release of glutamate in real-time. In addition to regular glutamate releases, which are typical for the synaptic activity of neurons, he also observed very unusual, local glutamate signals that were relatively large, long-lasting, and heterogeneous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Under normal conditions, these atypical events occurred only sporadically,” he reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, after inducing an energy deficiency, their frequency increased significantly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal glutamate release comes to a halt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these events were the main cause of the increase in extracellular glutamate concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems that under metabolic stress conditions, such as energy depletion, these atypical release events are particularly favored, which led to the accumulation of glutamate,” Professor Andreas Reiner concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, the normal glutamate release by neurons, which itself requires substantial amounts of energy, came to a halt.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar observations had previously only been described for a migraine model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In further experiments, the team was able to show that increased extracellular glutamate concentrations promoted additional release events. The process is therefore self-reinforcing. Conversely, the researchers were able to significantly reduce this type of glutamate release by inhibiting glutamate receptors, especially by inhibiting the subclass of NMDA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not yet answer exactly how the unusual neurotransmitter releases occur and which cell types are responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further investigations must also clarify how much this type of release actually contributes in stroke situations or in neurodegenerative diseases,” says Andreas Reiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is well established that elevated glutamate concentrations are harmful to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfa5baa3a6aee1b8aaa6a3aabd8fbdbaade1abaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julia Weiler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rub.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julia Weiler – RUB&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2025.112256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Atypical Plume-Like Events Contribute to Glutamate Accumulation in Metabolic Stress Conditions&lt;/a&gt;” by Andreas Reiner et al. &lt;em&gt;iScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atypical Plume-Like Events Contribute to Glutamate Accumulation in Metabolic Stress Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural glutamate homeostasis is important for health and disease. Ischemic conditions, like stroke, cause imbalances in glutamate release and uptake due to energy depletion and depolarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We here used the glutamate sensor SF-iGluSnFR(A184V) to probe how chemical ischemia affects the extracellular glutamate dynamics in slice cultures from mouse cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SF-iGluSnFR imaging showed spontaneous glutamate release indicating synchronous network activity, similar to calcium imaging with GCaMP6f. Glutamate imaging further revealed local, atypically large, and long-lasting plume-like release events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plumes occurred with low frequency, independent of network activity, and persisted in tetrodotoxin (TTX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking glutamate uptake with TFB-TBOA favored plumes, whereas blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) suppressed plumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During chemical ischemia plumes became more pronounced, overly abundant and contributed to large-scale glutamate accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar plumes were previously observed in cortical spreading depression and migraine models, and they may thus be a more general consequence of glutamate uptake dysfunctions in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 20:04:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBHWFRWTjQwczNrb29POHRCZTZOdTVjdVVhUHo1b21Fc0Fxd2VPSXd6SkZxZVhwNWRDT1ZoVGdvU2R1S2cydE9GZ0hTVDg2d0czbV8zX1Z5V05sb2hKTWZFWDkzWVgzd0w5UExoU1RLQVQwQQ</guid></item><item><title>在视网膜厚度中发现的精神分裂症风险的眼睛线索-神经科学新闻 | Eye Clues to Schizophrenia Risk Found in Retinal Thickness - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFA3RWlFNTZ5aFRrdEZLNHo2SmNaT0U2NFJNZENVY291WnVhWTJETFVJd29ZNjFFQUJOS2QzTHkyLTlUR01pN2dHNzFsRTUyOGVzdFViNURqUzNfT21oU2JkeEt2Rmc4VmpxXy00VWtJNUkzeUJZTEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;The retina, as part of the central nervous system, may reflect early signs of brain disorders like schizophrenia. A large-scale genetic study found that people with higher genetic risk for schizophrenia tend to have thinner retinas, even in the absence of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These subtle changes were detected using optical coherence tomography, a fast and non-invasive eye scan. The findings also support the inflammation hypothesis of schizophrenia, suggesting new possibilities for early detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retinal Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with thinner retinas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Retinal thickness can be measured in minutes using optical coherence tomography.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Connection:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetic variants tied to inflammation may underlie both brain and retinal changes in schizophrenia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Zurich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The retina is part of the central nervous system and therefore a direct extension of the brain. This is why changes in the brain could potentially also be detected in our eyes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers led by the University of Zurich and the University Hospital of Psychiatry Zurich has now tackled this very question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108969"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/schizophrenia-retinal-thickness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study shows that higher genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia is indeed associated with thinner retinas. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers examined whether changes in our nerve connections are linked to a genetic risk for schizophrenia, as impaired neural information processing is one of the main characteristics of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that schizophrenia not only reduces volume of gray matter in the brains of those affected, but that it also leads to loss of retinal tissue. However, whether these changes are the cause of schizophrenia or a consequence of the disorder has remained unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retinal health could also be affected by schizophrenia itself, for example through antipsychotic medication, lifestyle factors or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive use of data from healthy individuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To investigate whether the risk of developing schizophrenia has an effect on the central nervous system, we examined tens of thousands of healthy individuals,” says Finn Rabe, first author of the study and postdoc at the University of Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We then calculated polygenic risk scores for each individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to use extensive genetic and retinal data taken from the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database containing data from over half a million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could say that the scale of the UK Biobank’s data has revolutionized biomedical research,” the researcher adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thin retina, elevated risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that higher genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia is indeed associated with thinner retinas. However, the effects are small and can only be reliably demonstrated in large-scale studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s findings is that, unlike changes in the brain, changes in the retina are easy to detect using non-invasive and inexpensive retinal measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to optical coherence tomography, which can be described as a kind of ultrasound for the eye, retinal thickness can be measured within a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offers a promising outlook for prevention. “Our study shows the potential of using optical coherence tomography in clinical practice. But large-scale longitudinal studies are needed to examine how useful it will be for prevention,” says Finn Rabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives for new therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding of the study concerns genetic variants associated with inflammatory processes in the brain. These may also contribute to structural changes in the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study thus offers further support for the inflammation hypothesis of schizophrenia, i.e., the idea that inflammatory processes contribute to the development or progression of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this hypothesis is confirmed, inflammation could be interrupted by medication, potentially enabling us to improve treatment possibilities in the future,” says Rabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience and schizophrenia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#55383039343b3c307b3b2c3330393027153e3a3838203b3c3e34213c3a3b7b202f3d7b363d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Melanie Nyfeler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uzh.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Zurich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Melanie Nyfeler – University of Zurich&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00414-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia through neuroinflammatory pathways associated with retinal thinness&lt;/a&gt;” by Finn Rabe et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia through neuroinflammatory pathways associated with retinal thinness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is associated with structural and functional changes in the central nervous system, including the most distal part of it, the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the question of whether retinal atrophy is present before individuals develop schizophrenia or is a secondary consequence of the disorder remains unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we address this question by examining the association between polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia and retinal morphologies in individuals without a schizophrenia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used population data for 34,939 white British and Irish individuals from the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our robust regression results show that higher polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia were associated with thinner overall maculae, while controlling for confounding factors (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = −0.17, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we found that greater polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia specific to neuroinflammation gene sets were associated with thinner ganglion cell inner plexiform layers (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = −0.10, self-contained &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.014, competitive &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results provide new evidence for genetic factors that could predispose individuals to heightened neuroinflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, these responses could contribute to neurodegenerative processes such as retinal thinning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:45:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFA3RWlFNTZ5aFRrdEZLNHo2SmNaT0U2NFJNZENVY291WnVhWTJETFVJd29ZNjFFQUJOS2QzTHkyLTlUR01pN2dHNzFsRTUyOGVzdFViNURqUzNfT21oU2JkeEt2Rmc4VmpxXy00VWtJNUkzeUJZTEE</guid></item><item><title>锻炼肌肉需要多长时间？这是事实- GQ | How Long Does It Take to Build Muscle?

The thinking is that this fast-tracks muscle growth. Cox says “aiming to push yourself anywhere from 1-3 reps shy of failure seems to be beneficial,” findings which are backed up by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4731492/"&gt;multiple studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need to be obsessed with a high protein diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything from yogurt to cereal is touted as high protein at the moment, but does adding protein to your diet make a difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve learned the principles of building muscle, and the most efficient way to do it, above. But what about the actual building blocks of muscle itself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to build muscle, the body must be in what is called an &lt;em&gt;anabolic state&lt;/em&gt;,” says Cox. To get into this state, you need to be taking on more calories than you’re burning off. Think of it like a construction site. The more bricks you make available, the faster the building can grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true of muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An adequate protein consumption stimulates muscle protein synthesis, which helps to build up your muscle fibers,” says Cox. “A protein intake of 1.6-2.2 gram per kilogram of bodyweight is considered to be optimal for maximizing muscle growth.”  In other words, if you weigh about 175 pounds, you should aim for a daily protein intake of 128g-176g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s true that protein can make you feel full and is therefore a way to lower calorie intake if you’re trying to lose weight, it isn’t calorie &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;, so you will still see you weight gain if you overdo it. Plus, your bowels won’t be in the best shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Carbohydrates are also really important when trying to build muscle as they are the body’s main source of energy for workouts,” Weston notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t sleep on healthy fats, either. “They are a great source of energy for exercising, so you can push yourself harder in your workouts and therefore build muscle,” says Weston. “Plus, fats are also so important for hormone and cell health, including muscle cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any truth behind the fad workouts and diets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but no. “I am a firm believer that silver bullets don’t exist, particularly when it comes to fitness,” says Cox. “The solution you’re actually searching for is right in front of you: consistency over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weston seconds that: “Building muscle shouldn’t feel too complicated. Just stick to a routine, with proper form and allowing a few rest days per week, rather than trying to follow a fad workout program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the fastest way to build muscle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re exercising a couple of times per week and have adjusted your diet accordingly, Weston reckons you’ll see results in about six to eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite a slow process,” she says. Nor, Cox adds, can it be accelerated—without taking steroids, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people will try and shortcut the process by doing more workouts or doing longer workouts and while that seems like it should work, it will often just cause more fatigue without any additional stimulation,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:36:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9lMXhrX0pTdEFVaWgxSTQ5VlV1aVBDaXhjUlVJME8yOFV0Q2xVQU1YSlV0dkVwMEVYQnhpWGN5U1p6ZUFUMF8xcnlUR01hdlliZzlRNWUtZTQ0T0VkcHNmcU5EeTdXZkE3Sk1SX3NBSQ</guid></item><item><title>得益于多巴胺，您的大脑从恐惧中学习-神经科学新闻 | Your Brain Learns From Fear, Thanks to Dopamine - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9TVEpFLVNFM3ZFd0ZRWC10d2JUdGU3M2VJclg1QVJtRUFjbm5qSlp2NmUtYy1MYkVjbllWMlRjbk9zbGt3VlV2TmQ0R2laa1ZyT0dTVU0yVmtKUGVRLVhkTm5MbmwxSzNFWE9qN1pTdmxBdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals how dopamine helps the brain learn to avoid unpleasant outcomes by responding differently in distinct brain regions during negative experiences. In a study with mice, scientists tracked dopamine activity over time as animals learned to escape an adverse event, showing that one brain area adapted early in learning while another supported long-term avoidance behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge simplistic views of dopamine as purely “rewarding” and suggest it plays a critical role in adaptive — and maladaptive — learning from threats. The study may offer insights into psychiatric conditions marked by excessive avoidance, like anxiety and OCD, and underscores why the trendy idea of a “dopamine detox” misses the complexity of this vital brain chemical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Evolves With Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Dopamine activity changes over time depending on how well an animal learns to avoid danger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Different Brain Areas, Different Roles:&lt;/strong&gt; The ventromedial shell responds early in avoidance learning; the core supports long-term threat prediction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oversimplified Detox Trend:&lt;/strong&gt; The popular “dopamine detox” wellness trend ignores dopamine’s crucial role in adaptive behavior and learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine is the brain’s motivational spark, driving us to chase what feels good, say scrolling another reel on social media, and steer clear of what doesn’t, like touching a hot stove. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But scientists haven’t fully understood how dopamine helps us learn to avoid bad outcomes — until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108965"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox.jpg" alt="This shows a woman's head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/dopamine-learning-neuroscience-detox-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found that the two areas of the nucleus accumbens responded differently. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Northwestern University shows that dopamine signals in two key brain areas involved in motivation and learning respond differently to negative experiences, helping the brain adapt based on whether a situation is predictable or controllable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous research has shown that dopamine can respond to negative experiences, this is the first study to track how those signals evolve over time as animals move from novices to experts in avoiding them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study will be published April 22 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors said the findings help explain how we learn from bad experiences, and why some people learn to avoid danger better than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also shed light on how excessive avoidance — a hallmark symptom of multiple psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression — may come to be via alterations in dopamine function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to an overestimation of danger in the environment and a decreased quality of life as the brain prioritizes avoiding certain experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the study helps explain why the concept behind the recent “dopamine-detox” wellness trend is too simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine is not all good or all bad,” said first author Gabriela Lopez, a doctoral candidate in the Interdepartmental Neuroscience Program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It rewards us for good things but also helps us tune into cues that signal trouble, learn from consequences and continuously adapt our learning strategies in unstable environments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the study worked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, scientists trained mice to respond to a five-second warning cue that predicted an unpleasant outcome. If the mice moved to the other side of a two-chamber box during the warning cue, they could avoid the outcome entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the mice learned the task, researchers recorded dopamine activity in two areas of the nucleus accumbens, a brain region involved in motivation and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research had suggested that dopamine in the ventromedial shell of the nucleus accumbens increases during bad experiences, while dopamine in the core of the nucleus accumbens decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the scientists wanted to understand how these different dopamine responses work together when the mice learn to avoid bad experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the two areas of the nucleus accumbens responded differently:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the ventromedial shell, dopamine levels initially surged in response to the unpleasant event itself. As the mice actively learned about the meaning of the warning cue, the dopamine response shifted to the cue itself. Eventually, though, the dopamine response faded away as the mice became skilled at avoiding the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the core, dopamine decreased for both the unpleasant event and the warning cue. The reduction in dopamine in response to the warning cue steadily increased throughout training, especially as the mice became more successful at avoiding the event. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These responses are not only different in their sign — where in one area, dopamine goes up for something bad and, in the other area, it goes down for something bad — but we also saw that one is important for early learning while the other one is important for later-stage learning,” said corresponding author Talia Lerner, associate professor of neuroscience and psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Feinberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the researchers tested what would happen when the outcome couldn’t be avoided, regardless of the mice’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under those conditions, dopamine patterns returned to what they looked like earlier in training — suggesting that these brain signals are sensitive to context and may help animals adapt their behavior when the environment changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shows that the dopamine signals are flexible, sensitive to task rules, and may help us adapt to changes in the environment,” Lopez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why a ‘dopamine detox’ is too simplistic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have been singing the praises of the “dopamine detox” wellness trend — cutting out things that trigger a dopamine rush, like eating junk food or scrolling social media, to regain control over these behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this study helps explain why the concept of a “dopamine detox” is too simplistic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think of dopamine as a learning molecule that is important for normal behavior in everyday life,” Lopez said. “So, cutting it out completely can do more harm than good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dopamine signals we are studying are important for representing aversive signals that are involved in problems like chronic pain, depression and withdrawal from addictive substances,” Lopez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overactive avoidance learning may also be a pathway that contributes to obsessive-compulsive disorder and other clinical anxiety disorders. We hope to follow up on these basic research findings to address clinical problems affecting patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this dopamine and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f29981939f87979e819d9cb29c9d80869a8597818697809cdc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristin Samuelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kristin Samuelson – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.04.006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Region-specific nucleus accumbens dopamine signals encode distinct aspects of avoidance learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Gabriela Lopez et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Region-specific nucleus accumbens dopamine signals encode distinct aspects of avoidance learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoidance learning—learning to avoid bad outcomes—is an essential survival behavior. Dopamine signals are widely observed in response to aversive stimuli, indicating they could play a role in learning about how to avoid these stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is unclear what computations dopamine signals perform to support avoidance learning. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity in dopamine responses to aversive stimuli has been observed across nucleus accumbens (NAc) subregions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how heterogeneous dopamine responses to aversive stimuli contribute to avoidance learning, we recorded NAc core (Core) and NAc ventromedial shell (vmShell) dopamine during a task in which mice could avoid a footshock punishment by moving to the opposite side of a 2-chamber apparatus during a 5-s warning cue. Both signals evolved substantially—but differently—with learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that Core and vmShell dopamine signals responded oppositely to shocks at the beginning of training and oppositely to warning cues as cue-shock associations developed in mid-training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core dopamine responses strengthen with learning and are especially evident during expert performance. vmShell dopamine responses to cues and shocks were present during early learning but were not sustained during expert performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data support a model in which Core dopamine encodes prediction errors that guide the consolidation of avoidance learning, while vmShell dopamine guides initial cue-shock associations by signaling aversive salience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 19:10:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9TVEpFLVNFM3ZFd0ZRWC10d2JUdGU3M2VJclg1QVJtRUFjbm5qSlp2NmUtYy1MYkVjbllWMlRjbk9zbGt3VlV2TmQ0R2laa1ZyT0dTVU0yVmtKUGVRLVhkTm5MbmwxSzNFWE9qN1pTdmxBdw</guid></item><item><title>导致湾区流感病例激增的脊髓灰质炎样疾病的病毒- SFGATE | Virus that causes polio-like illness found in Bay Area as influenza cases spike - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNLUZ5OGhOTkprTHVLTGhMM3BpOEFjazZqTkVHS1MtSXBIQmxKaE0wUGRUUGstMTdUNTU5cXU4NUhlQ1RSZWcyeGxxZHFUcXUtOEpqSTN5STI3R0hHekUtNXdJaGw1QmNVX3puMGQ4THJVaWZITEtTaHF3Qy12QThIaFg1WUZKWHhxSWdLc1ZUT29zc3M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downtown San Jose, Calif. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Steve Proehl/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get your gallon of hand sanitizer out from underneath the kitchen sink, because while COVID-19 levels may be low, a slew of other &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-bay-area-flu-season-cases-increasing-20159536.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;respiratory illnesses&lt;/a&gt; are riding high in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to recent data from &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22San%20Jose,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22c8d357b9%22%7D&amp;amp;plantId=c8d357b9&amp;amp;charts=CjIQACABSABaBkhNUFZfNHIKMjAyNS0wMy0xMXIKMjAyNS0wNC0yMooBBmEwZjcxM8ABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=a0f713&amp;amp;target=HMPV_4" data-link="native" class=""&gt;WastewaterScan&lt;/a&gt;, a Stanford-run program that tracks viral traces in local wastewater, levels of influenza B — a virus that causes similar symptoms as the flu — were prevalent throughout virtually the entire region as of Tuesday morning. But for local infectious diseases experts, this information comes as no surprise: This past February, they remarked that California experienced one of the &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-bay-area-flu-season-cases-increasing-20159536.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;worst flu surges of the century&lt;/a&gt;, which led to an increased number of deaths and hospitalizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="Inline-1" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had a really terrible flu season this year,” Dr. Monica Gandhi, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco, told SFGATE. About two months ago, California had a flu rate of 27.8%, just a few percentage points behind the national rate of 31.6%, &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-bay-area-flu-season-cases-increasing-20159536.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;SFGATE previously reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, California Department of Public Health data shows that rates have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Respiratory-Viruses/Respiratory-Virus-Report/RespiratoryVirusReportWeek15.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;decreasing since February&lt;/a&gt; — but disease is still in high circulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no doubt there’s a lot of respiratory viruses,” Gandhi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21669-enterovirus-d68" data-link="native" class=""&gt;EV-D68&lt;/a&gt;, is also circulating in the Bay Area, WastewaterScan data suggests. Though it usually has little impact on adults, if unchecked, it can lead to severe, life-long impacts on children and teenagers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/enterovirus/spread-enterovirus-d68-linked-polio-illness-may-have-risen-50-over-10-years" data-link="native" class=""&gt;First identified in California in 1962&lt;/a&gt;, enterovirus-D68 once appeared in small, isolated clusters but has since become more common on a &lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/76609" data-link="native" class=""&gt;worldwide scale&lt;/a&gt;, appearing in the late summer and fall, according to a 2023 University of Minnesota article. Rates of the illness were particularly high in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26489019/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;U.S. in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in 1,153 infections in 49 states, a 2016 article published in the Journal of Medical Virology article shows. At the time, it was the largest number of infections ever recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the virus&lt;/a&gt; typically causes mild symptoms that mimic the common cold. Like many respiratory diseases, it’s found in sputum, mucus and contaminated surfaces and can be spread through coughing and sneezing. Though adults are more likely to be asymptomatic, young children — especially those with asthma — could develop a rare polio-like complication called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21669-enterovirus-d68" data-link="native" class=""&gt;temporary or permanent&lt;/a&gt; paralysis. Symptoms include difficulty swallowing, slurred speech and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;arm or leg weakness&lt;/a&gt;, among several other physical signs. No vaccine is available for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these respiratory illnesses have “come in to fill a vacuum,” Gandhi explains, meaning that more people acquired immunity to COVID-19 but haven’t been exposed to other viruses like influenza as much over the years, making them more susceptible to infection. Levels of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/human-metapneumovirus/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;human metapneumovirus&lt;/a&gt;, another respiratory illness, are also high in North Bay regions like Marin, Santa Rosa and Napa, wastewater data suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, agrees with Gandhi’s explanation. Though the Golden State is faring slightly better than the rest of the U.S., it’s “still seeing a considerable amount of influenza” in particular, he told SFGATE Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the numbers are low, there’s still a lot of virus circulating and people getting sick,” he said. This viral trend is also right on time: Influenza A begins in the late fall and peaks in January and sometimes even mid-February. When it begins to wane in March and April, influenza B trickles in, he explained. Fortunately, he says, it’s a “blip” compared with the highly mutable influenza A and will likely taper off by next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Swartzberg says it’s difficult to explain why WastewaterScan data is showing that areas like Santa Rosa, Santa Clara and San Jose are struggling with high levels of EV-D68. It spikes every few years, he says, but its epidemiology isn’t fully understood. “Other than that, we know that wastewater tends to portend actual infections that we’re seeing,” he told SFGATE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To protect yourself from these illnesses, Gandhi recommends staying home when you’re sick, staying away from others who are sick, socializing in well-ventilated spaces and getting the flu vaccine.

Participants who developed clear spatial memory of which areas contained “stinging bees” (simulated by mild shocks) exhibited lower anxiety, while those who couldn’t differentiate the zones maintained high anxiety—even in safe spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that temporary anxiety had a stronger effect on learning than general anxiety traits. This suggests that heightened situational fear may interfere with threat recognition and spatial awareness, potentially contributing to anxiety disorders like PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary Anxiety Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Short-lived anxiety episodes had a stronger influence on learning safety cues than chronic anxiety levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial Memory Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Better spatial learning was associated with lower anxiety and accurate threat recognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may explain mechanisms behind PTSD and other anxiety disorders, offering insight for future therapies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A brief episode of anxiety may have a bigger influence on a person’s ability to learn what is safe and what is not. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research recently published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Science of Learning&lt;/em&gt; used a virtual reality game that involved picking flowers with bees in some of the blossoms that would sting the participant—simulated by a mild electrical stimulation on the hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108961"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a blurry face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Anxiety-learning-threat-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Surprisingly, they discovered that temporary feelings of anxiety had the biggest impact on learning and not a person’s general tendency to feel anxious.

Claire Marino, a research assistant in the ZVR Lab, and Pavel Rjabtsenkov, a Neuroscience graduate student at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, were co-first authors of the study that found that the people who learned to distinguish between the safe and dangerous areas—where the bees were and were not—showed better spatial memory and had lower anxiety, while participants who did not learn the different areas had higher anxiety and heightened fear even in safe areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, they discovered that temporary feelings of anxiety had the biggest impact on learning and not a person’s general tendency to feel anxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results help explain why some people struggle with anxiety-related disorders, such as PTSD, where they may have difficulty distinguishing safe situations from dangerous ones,” said the senior author of this study, Benjamin Suarez-Jimenez, PhD, associate professor of Neuroscience and Center for Visual Science at the Del Monte Institute of Neuroscience at the University of Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings suggest that excessive anxiety disrupts spatial learning and threat recognition, which could contribute to chronic fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding these mechanisms may help improve treatments for anxiety and stress-related disorders by targeting how people process environmental threats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suarez-Jimenez explains that it is now important to understand if individuals with psychopathologies of anxiety and stress have similar variations in spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding an attention-tracking measure, like eye-tracking, to future studies could help determine whether a focus on potential threats impacts broader environmental awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Caitlin Sharp, Zonia Ali, Evelyn Pineda, Shreya Bavdekar, Tanya Garg, Kendal Jordan, Mary Halvorsen, Carlos Aponte, and Julie Blue of the University of Rochester Medical Center, and Xi Zhu, PhD, of Columbia University Irving Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, Wellcome Trust Fellowship, and the European Research Council Grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this anxiety and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a8e3cdc4dbc1cdf7fbc5c1dcc085e0c9d1ccddc3e8dddac5cb86dac7cbc0cddbdccdda86cdccdd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kelsie Smith Hayduk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://urmc.rochester.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kelsie Smith Hayduk – University of Rochester&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41539-025-00305-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Using virtual reality to study spatial mapping and threat learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Claire Marino et al. &lt;em&gt;npj Science of Learning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using virtual reality to study spatial mapping and threat learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using spatial mapping processes to discriminate between threat and safety is crucial for survival. Little is known why some fail to discriminate during contextual conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a virtual reality (VR) contextual conditioning paradigm to elucidate the effects of state and trait anxiety on contextual threat learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 70) “picked” flowers in a VR environment.

One dose is 93% effective and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says.

He works as a realtor helping to sell houses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Peter 'Francis' Brennan, 39, has embarked on a mammoth weight loss to slash his weight from 635 to below 250lbs. He is currently at 283lbs, and is pictured above this month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high levels of fats and low carbohydrates puts the body into ketosis, a state where it burns bodyfat instead of carbohydrates for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many doctors, including Brennan's, warn people not to use the diet saying that it can cause high levels of LDL or bad cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause plaques to build-up in the arteries, restricting blood flow and raising the risk of complications like high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and a heart attack — which he was already at risk of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some, however, say it's a life changer, including podcaster Joe Rogan and controversial psychologist Jordan Peterson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Advocates say the carnivore diet allows them to lose weight rapidly and boost their energy levels, sleep and sexual performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brennan said he now consumes three meals a day, with each weighing six ounces and composed entirely of eggs mixed with sliced chicken and turkey sausages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He aims to get in about 130 to 170 grams of protein daily, well above the US National Dietary Guidelines recommendation of about 0.36 grams of protein per pound of body weight — or 101 grams a day for Brennan, who weighs 283lbs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For snacks, he consumes peanuts and cottage cheese — which aren't strictly part of the carnivore diet but are used in the keto diet to keep burning fat for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He doesn't consume red meat amid concerns that it could cause colon cancer and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brennan shown in the gym this month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brennan started on the carnivore diet in June 2024, after spending a year and four months on Wegovy — injecting himself once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also had gastric sleeve surgery in June 2024, when the stomach is surgically reduced to limit the amount of food someone can consume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgeons were shocked operating on him, saying at the time that his stomach was three foot long — or about three times the average size for a person.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs caused him to lose 167lbs in a year and four months, which he used alongside a restrictive diet and exercise six times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the diet and surgery is what really yielded the results, leading him to lose an extra 185lbs the following nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His current weight is now 283lbs, which at 5ft 11in still puts him in the obese category with a BMI above 30. When he started his weight loss, his BMI was 88 — putting him in the category of severely obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He aims to get his weight below 250lbs before December — and then reach his goal of weighing between 200 and 225lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite the enormous success he has had, Brennan confessed he isn't feeling nearly as confident as he should — and its all down to the massive amount of loose skin hanging off his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When someone puts on a large amount of weight, the skin stretches to accommodate the new size. It may then struggle to return to its original size if someone later loses the weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Brennan's case, his loose skin is 'everywhere' — hanging off his chest, stomach, back, legs, arms, neck and his face. It isn't clear how much it weighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Peter is pictured above at the start of his weight loss journey. He has been posting his workouts online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't feel as confident as I should be after doing what I've done,' he said, 'just because I know it is just hanging there'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not how a normal person should look, I look like I've melted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Like, if it wasn't there I would be wearing smaller size clothes, and my legs wouldn't be as hidden.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as getting in the way, the skin can also chafe against itself and clothing — causing him to develop painful rashes that take days to clear up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His health insurance covered the Wegovy and gastric sleeve surgery, but has declined to cover the skin removal, saying this is cosmetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the mammoth procedure needed, doctors have estimated it will cost $90,000 — which he is fundraising for online.

Anything from an apple to a donut can send my blood sugar into a frenzy. This led me to wonder what happens to your body when you eat blueberries every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, founder of NutritionStarringYOU.com and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Easy-Pre-Diabetes-Cookbook-Healthy/dp/1507216556/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64542223%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauded for their low glycemic index and high antioxidant count, the delicious blue spheres make for a tasty ingredient in muffins, blended into smoothies, adorning a yogurt bowl, and much more. So, I added about a cup to my routine for over two weeks (eating them straight up, on their own as a snack) to see if I reaped the many purported benefits—of which there seem to be many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also emerging research on the role of blueberries in gut health and exercise recovery,” explains &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, founder of NutritionStarringYOU.com and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Everything-Easy-Pre-Diabetes-Cookbook-Healthy/dp/1507216556/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64542223%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11196611/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that eating blueberries every day may yield health benefits in just two weeks, Pincus points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though their seasonality varies depending on where in the world you’re located, they can be found year-round in the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I ate blueberries every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a type 1 diabetic, the biggest benefit I saw from eating blueberries every day was the effect it had on my blood sugar (a.k.a. blood glucose). Swapping my afternoon snack with them instead of a large apple or banana (which have, on average, more carbohydrates) allowed me to maintain more stable blood sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which measures the level of glucose between the layers of my skin. This showed the impact blueberries had on my general blood sugars—mainly, eating around a cup led to fewer spikes, and more even numbers than some higher-carb snacks. As a type 1 diabetic, I do need to administer insulin (I opt for an insulin pump) when I eat anything with carbohydrates (note: carbs, not just sugars).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I’m not one for ultra-processed foods, I do enjoy some low-cal, low-carb options from time to time. Swapping these for blueberries led me to feeling more satisfied, less weighed down, and more nourished.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential benefits of blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood sugars aside, I didn’t notice much of the purported benefits (more specifics below), including getting sick less (in fact, I ended up getting the flu a few days after completing this experiment). But research does note the following health benefits of eating blueberries:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Full of antioxidants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442370/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Antioxidants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; play an important role in reducing inflammation, and polyphenols found in blueberries are powerful antioxidants that prevent or reverse damage to cells caused by the aging process,” Pincus says. Antioxidants also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10630845/#:~:text=5.6.,et%20al.%2C%202006)." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:support the immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;support the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, so eating blueberries consistently may, in theory, help your body fight off illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Boost heart health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wild blueberries in particular (the tiny ones) have 33% more deep purply blue anthocyanins and two times the antioxidants of ordinary blueberries, which can help protect the cardiovascular system and reduce &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25578927/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;,” Pincus says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Help with cognition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30999017/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; is showing that wild blueberries can improve the cognitive performance of children and adolescents, and have been shown to slow cognitive decline with aging,” Pincus says. But more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Maintain stable blood sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is something that I’ve witnessed firsthand. I saw little spikes in my blood sugar in the hours following eating a cup (something that is not the case when opting for more carbohydrate-dense foods like a banana). Pincus notes that blueberries may help improve insulin sensitivity to assist with maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442370/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; back this up too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blueberry nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2346411/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (USDA), 100 grams of blueberries, or 3.5-ounces (around 1/2 cup), contains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calories: 57&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein: 0.7 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbs: 14.5 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar: 10 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber: 2.4 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat: 0.3 g&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you eat too many blueberries?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like just about anything in life, eating too many blueberries may cause some side effects. “Blueberries contain fiber, which most people do not consume enough of; however, too much for someone not used to a high fiber diet could result in gas, bloating, or discomfort,” Pincus notes. She says that blueberries contain &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/calcium-oxalate-stones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oxalates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oxalates&lt;/a&gt; (naturally occurring plant compounds that binds minerals), which are not a concern for most people. “However, those with a history of or predisposition for kidney stones may not want to overdo it.” Finally, she points out that though great in moderation, blueberries contain natural sugars, so eating too many may impact blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to eat more blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seamlessly add more to your routine by making any of the below delicious, healthy recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating blueberries every day left me with more stable blood sugars after consuming them, but that’s pretty much the main benefit I saw in my brief experiment. I do continue to eat them weekly, and have done so for years, so perhaps it’s been a gradual change that is too incremental for me to notice. Regardless, blueberries are one of my favorite foods, and I’ll continue to enjoy them as a part of a nutritious eating plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 16:02:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBlV3BmdW5keC1vRHg1SVlBcnhtc3lzNnBRXzllMXJ3ZktWdmhBd0ptY3dzSjNEd0hiZ3VZajZ2SkMtcHcxUHhQRzgxa25Ec1h3MTRLaG1pMEpHR21Sa2hEY1pVN2lSNFJpbTdKNFR5VQ</guid></item><item><title>地中海饮食促进心脏和骨骼健康：要吃的食物以及如何开始- CNET | Mediterranean Diet for Heart and Bone Health: Foods to Eat and How to Get Started - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQVjVTU3VIaU5FbHF1T3ZZTnFZRWt1RFJLYzZrT1lnWTlQSE1RMDhCTzZ1Zi01MTh5cFB2OHNHbHo1VkJCRTIzcDVyOC11LV9iZUR5WEh6eXRSYVBzOFN4RlpQd3dtRUo1TTRydnp0b1JpQ1JwaHl4WFhNNDQzSzg2TXU3ZEJJMy15SzNF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-diet/best-diets-overall" target="_self"&gt;US News and World Report&lt;/a&gt; has named the Mediterranean diet the best diet for the eighth year in a row. Many experts also consider it one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-weight-loss-diets-whole30-paleo-keto-and-more/" target="_self"&gt;best weight loss diets&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association stated in a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epdf/10.1161/STR.0000000000000475" target="_self"&gt;2024 Guideline for the Primary Prevention of Stroke&lt;/a&gt; that the diet has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke. Specifically, it is advised that adults with no prior cardiovascular disease and people with high or intermediate risk follow the Mediterranean diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;The benefits might not stop there. A recent study published in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832289" target="_self"&gt;JAMA Network Open journal&lt;/a&gt; analyzed the results of following the Mediterranean diet and exercising regularly in a group of overweight adults aged 55 to 75. Participants who walked for 45-minutes for six days a week, completed strength and flexibility exercises three times a week, did 30- to 40-minute resistance training two days per week &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; followed the Mediterranean diet had stronger and healthier bone densities at the end of the long-term study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet is a nutrient-rich, nonrestrictive diet that works for many people, and it might be an excellent way for you to refresh your diet this spring. If you're interested, here's everything you need to start the Mediterranean diet. But before you begin any new type of diet, make sure you speak with your doctor first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the Mediterranean diet? A breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mediterranean-diet-meal-plan#what-is-it" target="_self"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is inspired by the traditional diets of people who live along the Mediterranean coast. While each country's diet may vary, the Mediterranean diet consists mainly of plant-based foods, seafood, lean poultry, whole grains, nuts, beans, olive oil, herbs and spices. The key is to eat as much fresh food as possible since highly processed foods are limited in the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" target="_self"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York City, who is also part of CNET's medical review board, this is the ideal breakdown for the Mediterranean diet: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Green Mediterranean diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent popular variation of the Mediterranean diet is the green Mediterranean diet.

A &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/107/13/1054" target="_self"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that the green Mediterranean diet variation may be healthier for one's heart than the original diet.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INDIANAPOLIS — Two more measles cases have been confirmed in Indiana. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/idepd/diseases-and-conditions-resource-page/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Indiana Department of Health (IDOH)&lt;/a&gt; said the patients, who both live in Allen County, have been identified as a child who is unvaccinated and an adult whose vaccination status is unknown. Fort Wayne is the capital of Allen County. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials, the two people are recovering, and they are linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/health/5-new-measles-cases-confirmed-indiana-this-year-allen-county-health-indiana-department-of-health/531-fb06b1e4-6336-49d4-a2f6-4c02c2bb39dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;previous measles outbreak in Allen County in which six people were infected&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those six cases, the IDOH says the four minors were unvaccinated and the two adults’ vaccination status is "unclear." However, all them are recovering.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that spreads easily from person to person," the IDOH said in a news release. "It is an airborne disease, meaning it spreads through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, or talks. The virus can stay alive in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. Because measles is so easily spread, a single case is considered an outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, officials said. People born before 1957 are "presumed to be immune."&lt;strong id="isPasted"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indiana's cases follows &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/nation-world/measles-outbreak-second-child-death-west-texas/507-04b98dea-051c-4874-ae73-1667b546f8ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;the outbreak in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where two children died and hundreds are now infected. Nearly all of them were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/immunization/school-immunization-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;IDOH data from the 2023-2024 school year&lt;/a&gt;, only about 90% of kids in kindergarten were vaccinated for MMR statewide, which is less than the national average of 93%. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Marion County, the kindergarten MMR vaccination rate drops to 85%. And in the donut counties, MMR vaccination rates range from a high of 98% in Shelby County to a low of 86% in Morgan County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allen County is approximately 135 miles northeast of downtown Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Studies have found that pharmacy coupon websites can lead to significant savings for patients within dermatology, with GoodRx providing some of the highest rates of saving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class=" figure"&gt;&lt;div id="image-caption" class="text-gray-500 italic"&gt;&lt;div class="blockText_blockContent__TbCXh"&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;CostPlus was founded in 2022 by entrepreneur Mark Cuban to address one of the greatest needs in the prescription drug market. | image credit: zhenya / stock.adobe.com  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The cost-plus business model is a disruptive new benefits company changing the way prescription drugs are distributed. Born out of a national need to make prescription drugs affordable, the business model attempted to steer clear of pharmaceutical middlemen and directly bring patients their medication needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.drugtopics.com/view/how-lucyrx-is-changing-the-traditional-pbm-model"&gt;How LucyRx is Changing the Traditional PBM Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Although GoodRx is also trying to change the mold in the pharmacy benefits arena, Mark Cuban's CostPlus’ business model favors patients more than pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;“Unlike GoodRx, which negotiates with PBMs to offer coupons that lower the price consumers pay for prescription medications, Cost Plus Drugs lowers medication costs by cutting out PBMs entirely,” wrote Rachel Stubler for the Medical University of South Carolina.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; “Cost Plus Drugs negotiates directly with drug manufacturers to purchase generic medications at low list prices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;With an advertised 15% markup and $5 fee, Cuban’s company provides much-needed transparency within prescription drug benefits. However, as these business models are still quite novel—both companies were founded after 2010&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;—researchers are still trying to understand how these new ways of administering medications are a viable option for patients in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In the current study, researchers conducted an observational cost analysis of the cost savings presented by CostPlus and GoodRx regarding the most prescribed medications for dermatology. They retrieved drug prices from each company’s mobile app or website on November 26, 2023. GoodRx retail prices were averaged and only included data from New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago—the largest US metropolitan statistical areas. They also considered shipping and fees for both companies’ drugs.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;CostPlus drug prices were significantly less expensive across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;“The average medication cost, excluding shipping, was $17 through CostPlus and $31.21 through GoodRx,” they continued.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; “The average medication cost using the cheapest price available from GoodRx was $21.34, which remained significantly different from CostPlus. When a $2.60 shipping fee per medication was included, the average cost increased to $19.60, remaining significantly different from the average GoodRx cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;As it’s commonly disseminated in the media, CostPlus was shown to provide significantly more savings than its PBM-affiliated competition at GoodRx. With GoodRx’s positioning to work closely with PBMs, they are often seen as filling the pockets of corporations while making medication access harder for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;In November of last year, GoodRx and multiple market-leading PBMs were hit with 3 class action suits for the coupon company’s role working with PBMs to suppress reimbursement to small pharmacies.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The attention Mark Cuban’s company is getting, on the other hand, has been celebrated by patients and pharmacists alike—entities on the drug supply chain that experts would argue have gotten the worst of the pharmacy benefits system in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;“If you look at the history of the supply chain,” said Cuban at a University of Pennsylvania discussion on drug pricing.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; “There are people who have come up with really good ideas that have had an impact, but then somebody comes in to buy them up and kill them. Well, you know what? I don’t need any more money. I’m rich as hell. So, I don’t need to do this for more money. My joy comes from screwing the PBMs. Every one of these sales that we close [directly with the drug] manufacturers is like a great day with the sun shining brightly for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The current study significantly highlights the CostPlus company’s ability to reduce dermatology drug costs. However, as both companies, as well as PBMs, get more and more attention from places like the media and US Congress, researchers will gather more evidence to understand what the most viable model for prescription drug distribution should be in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;“CostPlus is a viable tool to reduce prescription medication burden within dermatology and especially among uninsured individuals or those with high-deductible health plans,” concluded the authors of the study.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; “CostPlus may offer patients and clinicians more convenience in addition to greater cost savings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.drugtopics.com/clinical/dermatology"&gt;Dermatology Resource Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t get left behind: Sign up today for our &lt;a target="_self" href="https://one.drugtopics.com/subscribe/"&gt;free Drug Topics newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and get the latest drug information, industry trends, and patient care tips delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;References&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;1.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of medical cannabis or marijuana for managing cancer-related symptoms such as pain, appetite loss and nausea has long been contested. The path to reaching a scientific consensus was obstructed by research restrictions posed by the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1490621" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; systematically reviewed over 10,000 peer-reviewed research papers on cannabis and various health outcomes and found strong agreement regarding the therapeutic usage of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+cannabis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical cannabis&lt;/a&gt; in the context of cancer. Cannabis has not only shown positive results in managing cancer-related symptoms due to its anti-inflammatory properties, but also in treating the disease as an anticarcinogenic agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the largest cannabis studies to date, and its findings are published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Oncology&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannabis contains several &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chemical+compounds/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chemical compounds&lt;/a&gt; called cannabinoids, and the two most widely studied ones are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cannabinoids interact with the chemical receptors in our body's endocannabinoid system—a signaling system that regulates functions such as memory, emotional processing, sleep and pain control—resulting in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/therapeutic+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;therapeutic effects&lt;/a&gt; in terms of cancer treatment and symptom management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is a sizable body of research on cannabis's effects in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt;, there is a lack of unified understanding owing to the broad and diverse nature of the research conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reach a cohesive conclusion about the therapeutic potential of cannabis, researchers from the Whole Health Oncology Institute and the Chopra Foundation brought together a wide range of studies—randomized trials, observational research, and case reports—covering everything from easing chemotherapy side effects to investigating its role as a possible anticancer agent.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers, with the help of AI, evaluated data from over 10,000 peer-reviewed research papers consisting of 39,767 data points related to cannabis and various health outcomes. They employed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/natural+language+processing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;natural language processing&lt;/a&gt;, which is a machine learning technology that enables computers to understand human language, to perform sentiment analysis and categorize opinions on the medical use of cannabis in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed the overwhelming consensus in favor of using medical cannabis for improving health, treating cancer, and managing cancer progression. Overall, the support for medical cannabis was found to be over 31 times stronger than that of not-supported sentiments, and over 36 times stronger than unclear sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest cannabis should be re-evaluated within the medical community as a treatment option. They also highlight that the outcomes of this study could guide future public health research and influence &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+practice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical practice&lt;/a&gt; and discussions surrounding the legal status of medical cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four months ago, a small pharmaceuticals company bought a medicine used to combat a rare growth disorder in children and quickly raised the list price by 150%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a dramatic boost — from $5,882 to $14,705 per vial — is the sort of move that often draws attention at a time when many Americans complain about rising drug costs. But the company, Eton Pharmaceuticals, argues there is no other way to keep its treatment on the market and make a profit. But its decision involves a calculated twist: a willingness to take a hefty loss on each Medicaid patient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gambit was prompted by the penalties that companies must pay to Medicaid when they raise the price of a medicine above the inflation rate, a consequence of a provision in a federal law that went into effect in early 2024. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan Act, pharmaceutical companies are now required to pay that difference in the form of a rebate to the government health care program.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers expected teenagers with healthy sleeping habits to score better than those who slept poorly, but were surprised at the impact that even small differences in sleep made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We think that it’s the sleep driving the better cognitive abilities, in part because we consolidate our memories during sleep,” said Barbara Sahakian, a professor of clinical neuropsychology at the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/cambridgeuniversity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A good night’s rest has long been linked to better mental performance, but researchers are still teasing apart what happens in adolescence when crucial brain development coincides with a shift towards later bedtimes and less sleep overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sahakian’s team and researchers at Fudan University in Shanghai analysed data from 3,222 young people in the adolescent brain cognitive development study, the largest long-term investigation into brain development and child health in the US. Those who took part had brain scans, cognitive tests, and tracked their sleep using Fitbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even those with the best sleeping habits got less sleep than experts recommend, the study found. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 13- to 18-year-olds should have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5078711/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;eight to 10 hours&lt;/a&gt; sleep per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The teenagers fell into three distinct groups. The first, about 39%, went to bed the latest and woke the earliest, sleeping on average seven hours and 10 minutes a night. The second group, about 24%, slept for seven hours and 21 minutes on average. The third, about 37%, went to bed the earliest, slept the longest, and had the lowest sleeping heart rates. They slept about seven hours and 25 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While there were no meaningful differences in the educational achievements of the different groups, those in group three scored highest on cognitive tests, followed by group two, and group one scored the worst. Brain scans showed that those in group three had the largest brain volumes and best brain functions. Details are published in &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115565" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sahakian said it was “surprising” that minor differences in sleep had such an impact, adding: “It suggests that small differences in sleep amounts accrue over time to make a big difference in outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For teenagers who want to improve their sleep and boost mental skills, Sahakian recommends regular exercise to help with sleep, and not using mobile phones or computers late in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Colin Espie, a professor of sleep medicine at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said: “One of the consequences of having highly evolved brains, that can perform complex tasks, is that as humans we are particularly dependent on sleep, not least in the developing years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“As this research shows, falling asleep late and getting less sleep is problematic. No doubt this is exacerbated on school days when young people need to get up relatively early for school, and play catchup on the weekends – a phenomenon known as social jet lag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He added: “We would do well as a society to place more emphasis on sleep by, for example, incorporating more sleep health content into personal and social education at secondary school.” Oxford’s Teensleep project proposes ways to help teenagers improve their sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gareth Gaskell, a professor of psychology at the University of York, welcomed the focus on early adolescence. “I would like to see more in the way of intervention studies during adolescence so we can find out how to help adolescents that might have suboptimal sleep patterns. Often, quite simple changes can be made to the bedtime routine, for example around screen use, to improve the timing and duration of sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQdGJ1MlctV19McHhfNmJPeHMxdm1lZHJVMTdXNWhlOERacXlpT3Vrem5XdExYX3VSTExBMHBucmFOQ2hld291U3ViOWVNYnc1aVlmQ1VTUkRWSVNhdDVKSEY1c3VqZkhiLXZHbC1fSnFxZVVtSjJEOHFqOUFsZG5mZEhSQXV1M05JbUtNRFJrM2FMcTc4NVVrVklZVUpVZ21IbXpF</guid></item><item><title>蒙大拿州35年来首次出现麻疹病例- Daily Kos | Montana has its first measles cases in 35 years - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZlNOUk9ySEsybHlrQlpLcU5vTFUxVXYyVjdNcDFwUEg5aXo1NWUyMHVzZUZ5eWlJbXgxVGFhZkIxZDVpMG44aEF4dWRXLS01bVVRVDF6MndLMWRvX3l2d0xqeUdsd3NIby1lSmZGV2Z0alRhZnpzRjNHblNIQXhEeUd2M21CdkxhUU1OTXJXc3IwZlZjUWhhNURHeVVpSFpT?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Montana is the ninth U.S. state to have an active measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. was up to 800&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2" target="_blank" title=""&gt;cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nationwide on Friday.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" target="_blank"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is driving the high numbers, with an outbreak centered in West Texas that started nearly three months ago and is up to 597 cases.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50" target="_blank"&gt;Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;died from measles-related illnesses near&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" target="_blank" title=""&gt;the epicenter in Texas,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;and an&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-death-new-mexico-texas-outbreak-b9aef6fdd51fbb4ebd1ce9ce28e33299" target="_blank"&gt;adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;

It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health experts fear the virus will&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2" target="_blank"&gt;take hold in other U.S. communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;with low vaccination rates and that the spread&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-6cfda9a944084c390bc70f0e7a37a426" target="_blank"&gt;could stretch on for a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North America, an outbreak in Ontario, Canada has sickened 925 from mid-October through April 16. That's on top of cases in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561" target="_blank"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;that the World Health Organization has said are linked to the Texas outbreak. A large outbreak in Chihuahua state has 433 cases as of April 18, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what else you&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c" target="_blank"&gt;need to know about measles in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas and New Mexico?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texas state health officials said Friday there were 36 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" target="_blank"&gt;597 across 25 counties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;— most of them in West Texas. Four more Texans were hospitalized, for a total of 62 throughout the outbreak, and Parmer and Potter counties logger their first cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials estimated about 4% of cases — fewer than 30 — are actively infectious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixty-two percent of Texas' cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has logged 371 cases since late January — just over 1% of the county's residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50" target="_blank"&gt;8-year-old child,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" target="_blank"&gt;child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;in late February — Kennedy said age 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced five new cases this week, bringing the state’s total to 63. Three more people were in the hospital this week, for a total of six since the outbreak started. Most of the state's cases are in Lea County. Two are in Eddy County and Chaves and Doña Ana counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. New Mexico reported its first&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-death-new-mexico-texas-outbreak-b9aef6fdd51fbb4ebd1ce9ce28e33299" target="_blank"&gt;measles-related death in an adult&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has 37 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state, health officials announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finney, Ford, Grant, Gray and Morton counties have fewer than five cases each. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state's first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases in Oklahoma remained steady at 12 total cases Friday: nine confirmed and three probable. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A state health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Rogers and Custer counties, but wouldn't say which counties had cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Ohio?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 30 measles cases in the state Thursday. The state county includes only Ohio residents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 14 cases in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, 14 in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties, the state said. The outbreak in Ashtabula County started with an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials in Knox County, in east-central Ohio, say there are a total of 20 people with measles, but seven of them do not live in Ohio. In 2022, a measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Indiana?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indiana confirmed two more cases Monday in an outbreak that has sickened eight in Allen County in the northeast part of the state — five are unvaccinated minors and three are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Pennsylvania?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In far northwest Pennsylvania, Erie County health officials declared a measles outbreak April 14 after finding two new cases linked to a measles case confirmed March 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has had nine cases overall this year, six of which are not linked to the outbreak, including international travel-related cases in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/health/documents/topics/documents/2025%20HAN/2025-787-3-13-ADV-%20Measles.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Montgomery County and one in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Michigan?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montcalm County, near Grand Rapids in western Michigan, has three linked measles cases. State health officials say the cases are tied to a large measles outbreak in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has seven confirmed measles cases as of Thursday, but the remaining four are not part of the Montcalm County outbreak. Michigan's last measles outbreak was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How many cases are there in Montana?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montana state health officials announced five cases Thursday in unvaccinated children and adults who had traveled out of state, and confirmed it was an outbreak on Monday. All five are isolating at home in Gallatin County in the southwest part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials are working to trace exposures in Bozeman and Belgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are Montana's first measles cases in 35 years. Health officials didn't say whether the cases are linked to other outbreaks in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been 800 cases in 2025 as of Friday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and 10 clusters — defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-asia-measles-rates-unicef-who-report-2f888732cc297090238956986fd89cc4" target="_blank"&gt;someone who caught the disease abroad&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related | &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/4/17/2316837/-The-measles-crisis-is-worse-than-we-know-and-the-CDC-can-t-keep-up" target="_blank"&gt;The measles crisis is worse than we know—and the CDC can’t keep up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because most children back then had measles and now have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-cdc-outbreak-chicago-mmr-vaccine-7ecdfef41e6dbd659c7ac8b80d5de38f" target="_blank"&gt;a rise in measles cases in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, including an outbreak in Chicago that&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-chicago-migrant-shelter-cdc-e58517c830f73e42266d45d45983c12b" target="_blank"&gt;sickened more than 60.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, has been detected in wastewater samples from a sewage plant in Greenville, NC. Samples from the plant tested in late March and early April indicate that someone in Greenville during that time had the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There are two genetic types of the Mpox virus, known as clade I and clade II. The type found in Greenville's wastewater was clade I. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"The detection of clade I mpox virus in wastewater surveillance tells us the virus is potentially here in our state, even though no cases have been reported and confirmed," said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;While no Mpox cases have been reported in the state, Sangvai urged doctors and other health care providers to be on the lookout for people showing the symptoms. Any Mpox infection should be reported to the local health department or the NCDHHS Division of Public Health’s 24/7 epidemiologist
on-call number: 919-733-3419.





&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/mpox?mc_cid=5621fa4c5f&amp;amp;mc_eid=e5671e7d27"&gt;Mpox infection&lt;/a&gt; is characterized by rash on hands, feet, chest, face or mouth, or near the genitals and symptoms like fever, chills and swollen lymph nodes. Mpox is primarily spread by prolonged close contact, typically skin-to-skin, often during sexual activity. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; "We encourage people who are at higher risk to protect themselves by getting vaccinated," Sangvai added. Those &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/mpoxvaxlocations"&gt;vaccines are available by appointment&lt;/a&gt; at all North Carolina county health departments.&lt;/p&gt;

Using CRISPR technology, the team programmed these cells to secrete an enzyme that breaks down beta-amyloid plaques only in affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models of Alzheimer’s, the therapy reduced inflammation, preserved neurons, and lowered biomarkers of brain injury. This novel approach could revolutionize treatment for Alzheimer’s and other brain disorders by turning immune cells into smart, living drug delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; Engineered microglia only activate in response to amyloid plaques.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced neuroinflammation and preserved neuronal health in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Adaptable platform for treating Alzheimer’s, brain cancer, and MS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new way to deliver disease-fighting proteins throughout the brain may improve the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological disorders, according to University of California, Irvine scientists. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By engineering human immune cells called microglia, the researchers have created living cellular “couriers” capable of responding to brain pathology and releasing therapeutic agents exactly where needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108939"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/microglia-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Microglia are immune cells that reside in the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health-supported study, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrates for the first time that microglia derived from induced pluripotent stem cells can be genetically programmed to detect disease-specific brain changes – like amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease – and then release enzymes that help break down those toxic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the cells were able to reduce inflammation, preserve neurons and synaptic connections, and reverse multiple other hallmarks of neurodegeneration in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients and families grappling with Alzheimer’s and related diseases, the findings offer a hopeful glimpse at a future in which microglial-based cell therapies could precisely and safely counteract the ravages of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Delivering biologics to the brain has long been a major challenge because of the blood-brain barrier,” said Mathew Blurton-Jones, UC Irvine professor of neurobiology and behavior and co-corresponding author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve developed a programmable, living delivery system that gets around that problem by residing in the brain itself and responding only when and where it’s needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using CRISPR gene editing, the team modified human microglia to secrete neprilysin – an enzyme known to degrade beta-amyloid – under the control of a promoter that only activates near plaques. The result was a highly targeted and pathology-responsive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer’s mouse models, these engineered microglia reduced the buildup of beta-amyloid and protected against damage to neurons and synapses, curbed inflammation, and even lowered a biomarker of neuronal injury in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remarkably, we found that placing the microglia in specific brain areas could reduce toxic amyloid levels and other AD-associated neuropathologies throughout the brain,” said Jean Paul Chadarevian, a postdoctoral scholar in the Blurton-Jones lab and first author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And because the therapeutic protein was only produced in response to amyloid plaques, this approach was highly targeted yet broadly effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Alzheimer’s, the research explored how human microglia respond in models of brain cancer and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the engineered cells adopted unique gene expression profiles – highlighting the potential to tailor them to a variety of central nervous system diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work opens the door to a completely new class of brain therapies,” said Robert Spitale, UC Irvine professor of pharmaceutical sciences and co-corresponding author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of using synthetic drugs or viral vectors, we’re enlisting the brain’s immune cells as precision delivery vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that much work remains to translate this platform into human trials, including demonstrating long-term safety and developing methods for scalable manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because the microglia are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, they could possibly be produced from a patient’s own cells, reducing the risk of immune rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayk Davtyan, Alina L. Chadarevian and Jonathan Hasselmann of UC Irvine, among others, also contributed to the study, which was a collaboration among the university’s Department of Neurobiology &amp;amp; Behavior, Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, and Sue &amp;amp; Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Grants from the National Institute on Aging, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine and Cure Alzheimer’s Fund supported the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About microglia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglia are immune cells that reside in the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. They act as the brain’s primary line of defense against infection and injury, performing like white blood cells do elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of microglia as the brain’s own surveillance and cleanup crew. They constantly scan the brain for signs of trouble – like pathogens, damaged cells or toxic proteins – and respond by engulfing and digesting harmful substances in a process called phagocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microglia also help regulate inflammation and support neuronal function and plasticity during brain development and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, in diseases like Alzheimer’s, microglia are found near amyloid plaques (clumps of toxic proteins), where they become activated and attempt to surround and clear this toxic debris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in chronic disease, their activity can become dysregulated, contributing to neuroinflammation and further neuronal damage. Because of their central role in both protecting and sometimes harming the brain, microglia are a major focus of neurological research and a promising target for therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics, microglia, and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#62160f1403110b010a2217010b4c070617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thomas Vasich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uci.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Thomas Vasich – UC Irvine&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2025.03.009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harnessing human iPSC-microglia for CNS-wide delivery of disease-modifying proteins&lt;/a&gt;” by Mathew Blurton-Jones et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harnessing human iPSC-microglia for CNS-wide delivery of disease-modifying proteins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widespread delivery of therapeutic proteins to the brain remains challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-microglia (iMG) could enable brain-wide and pathology-responsive delivery of therapeutic cargo, we utilized CRISPR gene editing to engineer iMG to express the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin under control of the plaque-responsive promoter, CD9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further determine whether increased engraftment enhances efficacy, we utilized a CSF1R-inhibitor resistance approach. Interestingly, both localized and brain-wide engraftment in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mice reduced multiple biochemical measures of pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, within the plaque-dense subiculum, reductions in plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and astrogliosis and preservation of neuronal density were only achieved following widespread microglial engraftment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we examined chimeric models of breast cancer brain metastases and demyelination, demonstrating that iMG adopt diverse transcriptional responses to differing neuropathologies, which could be harnessed to enable widespread and pathology-responsive delivery of therapeutics to the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 13:28:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE94elBJbDRNRV95VlV4Wi1SUWJESlRpd0JadnFFNU16eW5xR1o5MG1wQXZXY05kSElGOG5IVkwzWDQyN1VWZS1aZHpDbjdmdExiOWEyUkpPMFQ0RUZZWC1Rd1ZjYXZqM3VkMFJyYm1UdHpyaVU</guid></item><item><title>数百万美国人生活在没有空气质量监测的地区- Earth.com | Millions of Americans live in areas without air quality monitoring - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQOTNlQ3ZRZU5rcDRJYUhXckFYbURPbW9NZGtvMUliLTVsXzdVaFJaRldDMTdxbEVHNWM1MDNFY1BaQjhzVHBjWGozZy1OR2hQQXZfX04zUkFsOFFrZ2xRanI5cHppcmZmdjkybVZLUjRBelZNRUdjOGFSYnZNcFp3Q1FVbnFpOFNocExvT3BPMTYwUklCcmM0WHBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2023, smoke from Canadian wildfires blanketed cities like New York and Washington, D.C. The air turned orange. Headlines called it the worst air quality in the world. People wore masks again, not for COVID-19, but to avoid inhaling toxic particles. But what if you lived in a place with no way to measure that danger?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Penn State University&lt;/a&gt; reveals a chilling reality. More than 50 million people in the U.S. live in what researchers call “air quality monitoring deserts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are counties with no official monitoring stations to assess air pollution. Without these stations, we don’t know what people are breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-air-quality-monitoring-deserts"&gt;Air quality monitoring deserts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring deserts are places with zero air-quality stations. That means no sensors, no alerts, and no data on the pollutants people are exposed to each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, 1,848 counties in the U.S. qualify as monitoring deserts. That’s nearly 59% of all counties and covers about 40% of the land area in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exposure to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-people-die-from-air-pollution-each-year-yet-theres-still-a-lack-of-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;air&lt;/a&gt; pollution has been directly and indirectly to cancers, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, immune disorders and more,” said Alexis Santos, co-author of the study and associate professor at Penn State. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we are not measuring air quality in large regions of the country, then we do not know how significant air pollution problems are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-danger-of-data-gaps"&gt;The danger of data gaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air quality data helps determine public health responses. If a wildfire breaks out and there’s no monitoring, people cannot know whether it’s safe to go outside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a growing need to assess whether children should stay indoors or whether vulnerable people should wear masks. And yet, millions live in this uncertainty every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These gaps don’t just delay emergency responses. They affect how we understand long-term health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies link air &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/understanding-how-air-pollution-forms-may-help-us-prevent-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; to asthma, heart attacks, dementia, and premature death. But in unmonitored counties, those links remain invisible and unquantified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-minority-areas-lack-air-quality-monitoring"&gt;Minority areas lack air quality monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study linked demographic and economic factors to the presence – or absence – of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counties with high poverty, low high school completion, or larger Black and Hispanic populations are more likely to be unmonitored. These patterns held even after accounting for population size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Air pollution affects everyone’s health, so it is important for everyone in the nation to have access to accurate information about the quality of the air they breathe,” said Nelson Roque, assistant professor at Penn State and the study’s lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southern region was especially affected. In states like Mississippi, Georgia, and Arkansas, more than 75% of counties are monitoring deserts. These regions include parts of the “Southern Black Belt,” a historically marginalized area with persistent social and economic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-air-pollution-affects-consumer-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disadvantages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-air-monitoring-is-old-and-unreliable"&gt;Air monitoring is old and unreliable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-weakens-brain-function-and-focus-in-daily-tasks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Air&lt;/a&gt; monitoring in the U.S. began in 1957. Since then, more than 20,000 stations have been installed at some point. But by 2024, only 4,821 remained active. Many stations were decades old, with a median age of 26.1 years. Some stopped reporting due to technical issues or lack of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We ran this same analysis just a couple months apart, and we found that the number of air-quality monitoring sites had changed over that short period of time,” Roque said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These stations are in flux all the time, and data-reporting intervals also vary, which points to the need for investment in and modernization of this infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of consistency adds uncertainty. Researchers and communities rely on these stations for accurate trends. If the equipment goes offline, so does our ability to respond in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smartphones-can-t-replace-sensors"&gt;Smartphones can’t replace sensors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps may show air quality ratings, but they don’t gather air directly. These apps use data from nearby stations. If you live far from a monitoring site, your app could show safe air when, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-deaths-in-india-linked-to-air-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; levels are high. That’s misleading and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring deserts, by definition, depend on estimates from surrounding regions. In rural areas, that might mean using data from stations dozens or even hundreds of miles away. Local factors – like nearby industry, agriculture, or wildfires – can vary dramatically from region to region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means people in these counties might make poor health decisions based on faulty information. And public health officials lack the tools to guide them differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-air-quality-monitoring-gaps-reflect-injustice"&gt;Air quality monitoring gaps reflect injustice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental monitoring follows patterns of social inequality. The researchers found that counties with more agricultural or mining jobs and fewer educated adults were more likely to be unmonitored. Higher poverty levels also increased the odds of being a monitoring desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, areas with more Hispanic residents appeared less likely to be deserts. But when population size was factored in, this trend reversed. Counties with more Black residents consistently had higher odds of lacking monitoring, regardless of other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns are not accidental. “Generally speaking, infrastructure for health care, transportation, education and other areas are underdeveloped in rural counties,” Santos said. “This study demonstrated the pattern holds true for air-quality monitoring, as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-call-for-broader-monitoring"&gt;A call for broader monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Executive Order 14008 urged environmental equity. The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool now includes air quality as a measure of community disadvantage. Despite these efforts, monitoring deserts persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring infrastructure is concentrated in urban areas, where populations are dense. This makes sense for national averages, but fails millions in sparsely populated or economically struggling areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA and local partners must rethink this model. Where there is no data, there is no protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-local-efforts-and-global-parallels"&gt;Local efforts and global parallels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some states and cities try to fill the gap. For example, the New York City Community Air Survey collects seasonal data at multiple points across the city. These local programs give better insights into neighborhood conditions, yet not all regions have the resources or expertise to launch their own systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, many countries face similar problems. Citizen science, wearable sensors, and community-led efforts are helping close gaps. But in the U.S., a wealthier country with strong scientific institutions, the scale of unmonitored areas is concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers warn that areas without monitoring may actually experience worse air quality than we realize. Without data, these communities are invisible in national health research and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-needs-to-happen-next"&gt;What needs to happen next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fixing the system requires more than adding a few monitors. The technology must be modern, reliable, and consistent. It must cover both cities and rural areas. Most importantly, it must reflect a commitment to environmental justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors argue for equitable expansion of monitoring sites. Only then can we understand exposure, assess disparities, and design better public health responses. Until that happens, millions will keep breathing air they cannot see, cannot measure, and cannot trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring deserts expose more than air pollution. They reveal the cracks in how we protect public health. When a wildfire erupts or pollutants rise, people in these places won’t know.

New research is uncovering how retinal cells communicate using microRNA and extracellular vesicles (EVs), with the goal of slowing AMD progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists found that when microRNA-204 fails to regulate lipid metabolism in retinal immune cells, inflammation accelerates degeneration. The team hopes to engineer EVs to deliver therapeutic cargo to microglia, potentially rejuvenating aging cells and providing a more effective alternative to current AMD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MicroRNA Breakdown:&lt;/strong&gt; Loss of microRNA-204 function in retinal microglia may trigger AMD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVs as Therapy:&lt;/strong&gt; Extracellular vesicles could be engineered to deliver treatments to immune cells in the retina.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Treatments Lag:&lt;/strong&gt; Existing injections for AMD only help 10–15% of patients, highlighting the need for new approaches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s an unfortunate fact of aging: Live long enough and, eventually, reading this sentence will get difficult, even impossible. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three in 10 Americans older than 80 have some form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), while for Oklahoman octogenarians, it’s closer to 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new research from the University of Oklahoma aims to illuminate the causes of AMD and help clinicians peer into a black box of blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108935"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AMD-visual-retina-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team also found that microRNA-204 targets the Tgfbr2 gene in microglia, which is involved in inflammation and fat metabolism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from a four-year, $1.7 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, Jiyang Cai, Ph.D., a professor of biochemistry and physiology at the OU College of Medicine, is studying how cells in the retina communicate and whether the messages they send could be programmed to treat or slow AMD, the leading cause of adult blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cai and colleagues believe one trigger for AMD occurs when a tiny molecule, called microRNA-204, is no longer able to message the gene that regulates lipids in retinal microglia cells, which help maintain immune function in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we see more lipids in the microglia, we know that something is wrong,” Cai said. “It means that the microglia aren’t doing their job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine how the breakdown occurs, Cai and colleagues are mapping the links between cells and genes in the eyes of laboratory mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related macular degeneration begins with weakening of retinal pigment epithelium cells (RPEs), a layer of cells that support the retina’s photoreceptors. When degeneration occurs, the affected tissues call in immune cells to clear the metabolic products, which in turn triggers chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In published and preliminary studies, Cai has determined that RPE cells send signals via miRNA to microglia by using extracellular vesicles (EVs), tiny delivery vans that transport packages of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also found that microRNA-204 targets the Tgfbr2 gene in microglia, which is involved in inflammation and fat metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are now trying to understand is whether extracellular vesicles from RPE cells can be used or engineered to rejuvenate aging retinal microglia. In other words, perhaps the delivery vans can be programmed to carry cargo that is beneficial to the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to figure out how microRNAs in these extracellular vesicles interact inside the microglial cells, which might provide a mechanism for future treatments,” Cai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until now, we’ve just watched something get fed into a black box and done a readout of what comes out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this research, we’re trying to understand how cargo contents within EVs might contribute to the therapeutic effects of these vesicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cai said the results of these studies will provide insights into how EVs and their associated cargoes interact with two distinct cell types in the outer retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could also guide future applications of EV-based delivery of compounds to modulate microglia function and alleviate the progression of age-related retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, the strategy would be a welcome departure from current therapies. For patients with dry macular degeneration, the most common form of the disease, treatment includes injecting antibodies directly into the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these treatments are only about 10-15% effective at slowing the progression of the disease, Cai said. There are currently no treatment options for many of the patients with late-stage AMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, as promising as the work is, Cai said it won’t turn back time. Weaker vision is simply a part of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re looking to slow the progression of the degeneration rather than preventing it from happening,” he said. “Everybody will get some kind of degeneration with aging. But maybe we can turn it into a minor annoyance rather than a life-changing eventuality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research reported in this news release is supported by the National Eye Institute, a component of the National Institutes of Health, under award number R01EY035855-01A1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content of this news rlease is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AMD and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea8b9a988386c780c79d8386818f98998584aa859f829989c48f8e9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;April Wilkerson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ouhsc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;April Wilkerson – University of Oklahoma&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 12:53:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9tV1l0bHRDWmVReWcxTDdObTVfd1dXUUF5akpTMVd6YkhMMWhKeWNPWmg2a0dVeHZHdjJILVJPaGh4UmphakVnakRaSlA1VFhoVmp4MWt0aEhoaERTZ2hLNWY0YnlvMmhPTXZNSGY2LXpOODg</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，这种维生素可降低患常见癌症的风险- AOL.com | This Vitamin Lowers Your Risk of a Common Cancer, Study Finds - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFA3SEZwcmNUQXF6cElyWmdfbE9ybi01SUR2VXZxRzhYanREWDBmSmdxVkJ0N084Qm14Y0FFX1dGUHFJSFVHOWthREZ1Y0w2WkpKWndvWDJHYTRyamVEenNuelNwNVNKQ2xMUUhTZXhod3RLYnZmUk5B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Study: Vitamin Lowers Your Risk of a Common Cancer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;LaylaBird - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New research suggests good vitamin D levels may lower the risk of developing colorectal cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t the first study to find a link between vitamin D and colorectal cancer risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experts recommend staying on top of your vitamin D status&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1.4 million;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;1.4 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans live with colorectal cancer, and rates of the disease have been increasing in younger people for years. While there’s been a lot of emphasis on colorectal cancer screenings, many people also want to do what they can to lower the risk of developing this form of cancer in the first place. Now, new research suggests that your vitamin D levels may play a role in how likely you are to develop colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:18%;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;18%&lt;/a&gt; of Americans have inadequate vitamin D levels, the findings are eyebrow-raising. Of course, colorectal cancer is a complicated disease, and it’s hard to say that low vitamin D alone would cause someone to develop it. But the study is part of a growing body of data that has found a link between vitamin D and colorectal cancer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/wael-harb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wael Harb, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Wael Harb, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA; Jessica Cording, R.D., C.D.N., author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64541871%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; Scott Keatley, R.D., of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/veronika_fedirko.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronika Fedirko, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Veronika Fedirko, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of cancer prevention at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; Mónika Fekete, Ph.D., lead study author and professor in the Institute of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at Semmelweis University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the study found, plus what experts want you to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1351" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed data from 50 studies on adults who had colorectal cancer, who had a documented vitamin D deficiency, or who were given a vitamin D supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that vitamin D deficiency is strongly linked to a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer. “Maintaining optimal vitamin D levels and adequate dietary intake is crucial in preventing colorectal cancer and improving patient prognosis,” the researchers wrote in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a link between vitamin D deficiency and colorectal cancer? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D deficiency and colorectal cancer have been linked in the past.

Data from the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4981802/#:~:text=Results.,with%20decreased%20risk%20of%20CRC." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nurses’ Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nurses’ Health Study&lt;/a&gt; also discovered that women with the highest vitamin D intake had a 58% lower risk of developing colorectal cancer compared with people who had lower levels of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are reinforced by a substantial body of epidemiological data, making vitamin D one of the most biologically plausible and extensively studied nutritional factors in colorectal cancer risk reduction,” says &lt;a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/veronika_fedirko.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Veronika Fedirko, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Veronika Fedirko, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of cancer prevention at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “While some randomized clinical trials have shown mixed results—often due to factors such as dosage, timing, or baseline vitamin D concentrations—the association demonstrated in observational studies remains consistent and strongly supported by biological evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might vitamin D deficiency raise the risk of colorectal cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that could be behind this, according to &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/wael-harb" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Wael Harb, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Wael Harb, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA. A big factor is that vitamin D impacts your immune system, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D modulates immune responses,” he says. Specifically, vitamin D interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is in colon tissue, explains Scott Keatley, R.D., of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. “When activated, VDR can influence gene expression related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, which are all central processes in cancer development,” he says. “Low vitamin D levels may weaken these protective effects, allowing abnormal cells in the colon to survive and multiply.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D may also help reduce inflammation in the body (and gut), “which could potentially impact tumor development,” Dr. Harb says. On the flip side, having lower levels of vitamin D can let inflammation in your intestines go unchecked, raising the risk that colorectal cancer will develop, he explains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While vitamin D is not a substitute for screening or a healthy lifestyle, it is an important and relatively modifiable factor worth paying attention to—especially in individuals at higher risk of deficiency, such as older adults, people with limited sun exposure, those with darker skin, or individuals with chronic illnesses,” says Mónika Fekete, Ph.D., lead study author and professor in the Institute of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at Semmelweis University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much vitamin D do you need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin D varies by person and age, but most adults should get 600 international units (IU) daily, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH). Adults aged 70 and up should have 800 IU of vitamin D, per the NIH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know if I’m getting enough vitamin D?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few symptoms that can suggest you’re low on vitamin D. According to Jessica Cording, R.D., C.D.N., author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64541871%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the most common ones she sees are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Keatley says that most people with low vitamin D levels don’t have symptoms. That’s why it’s important to ask your doctor about checking your vitamin D levels. “A blood test is the most reliable way to get a sense of whether you have adequate vitamin D levels,” Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get enough vitamin D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people get vitamin D from exposure to the sun, but you can also get it from foods. The biggest &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g20506205/12-foods-high-in-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food sources of vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;food sources of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; are cod liver oil, trout, salmon, mushrooms, fortified milk, and fortified cereal, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/#h4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;.

However, he says that your vitamin D levels should be checked during your annual check-up to make sure they’re OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testing is especially important if you have limited sun exposure or frequent use of sunscreen (which is important for skin cancer prevention), darker skin, digestive disorders, chronic health conditions, older age, or are overweight or obese,” Dr. Fedirko says. “The test is simple and can be arranged through your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your levels of vitamin D are low, Keatley recommends looking for supplements with vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). “It’s more effective at raising blood levels than D2,” he says. A dose of 1,000–2,000 IU daily is common, per Keatley, but it’s important to talk to your doctor about dosing recommendations before taking a vitamin D supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3 - 5000 IU&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0797HQFGT?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64541871%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$19.00 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$19.00 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3 and K2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045X82OE?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64541871%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$30.95 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$30.95 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3 K2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CKY26DQQ?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64541871%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$18.50 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$18.50 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bone Strength Organic Calcium + Vitamin D3 + K2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MZ6YI2A?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64541871%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$42.34 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$42.34 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering when’s the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64477304/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-supplement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:best time to take vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;best time to take vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;? “Vitamin D is fat-soluble, so take it with a meal that contains fat for better absorption,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned about your vitamin D status or your colorectal cancer risk, talk to your doctor.

Dr. Joseph Antoun&lt;/a&gt; told DailyMail.com that he works to help bridge the gap between scientific research and practical solutions that help people live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The science of longevity is becoming democratized as more research demonstrates that simple interventions - from nutrition timing to stress management - can profoundly impact biological aging,' Antoun said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after years of research and treating patients, he said that he has a few general tips that can help people not only live longer, but also have more fulfilling and healthier lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Focus on relationships&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Antoun explained that social capital is crucial for emotional well-being and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why it's important for people to nurture meaningful relationships and create a strong sense of community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said to prioritize connections with family, friends, and your community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can look like scheduling a shared meal with loved ones, joining a community group that meets regularly, or calling a friend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Longevity doctor Dr. Joseph Antoun said that the focus is shifting from just living longer to living healthier as well (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Eat well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This one shouldn't be much of a surprise, but Dr. Antoun emphasized the importance of nutrition in your journey to living longer and healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Food is the only product we consume multiple times daily, making it a critical factor in longevity,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether this means choosing a healthy diet that works for you or making sure you're always getting as many nutrients as possible, Dr. Antoun said that your nutrition should absolutely be made a priority.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Again, this is all about making healthy choices for your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regular physical activity is essential for both physical and mental well-being,' Dr. Antoun said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even short bursts of exercise can have significant benefits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that finding an activity you enjoy and making it a consistent part of your routine is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you don't have much time to get in a full workout, he suggested taking morning walks, parking farther from entrances so that you have to walk further, taking the stairs instead of escalators, and standing up every hour at your desk.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Antoun said that focusing on nutrition and exercise is key to living longer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Manage stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress can cause a lot of damage to the body.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Chronic stress can accelerate aging, so it's crucial to have effective stress management techniques,' Dr. Antoun said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suggested meditation and mindfulness, as they can be extremely beneficial to relieving stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Also, don't underestimate the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing self-care,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Get good sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most people are not well rested, and this is affecting their ability to live longer, healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Antoun said that quality sleep is fundamental to health and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, good sleep hygiene can significantly impact your overall health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Aim to maintain a consistent sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimize your sleep environment,' Dr. Antoun said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi‑institution research team including Columbia, Vanderbilt, Johns Hopkins and others, report that nearly one in three new dementia cases in older adults is associated with hearing loss, based on statistical modeling of population data.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Dementia prevalence is expected to triple globally in the coming decades. Efforts to reduce its burden have increasingly focused on modifiable risk factors. Hearing loss, affecting more than two-thirds of older adults in the United States, has emerged as a potential correlating condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous estimates of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; associated with hearing loss in the United States have ranged from 2% to 19%. Variability across studies has been attributed in part to differences in how hearing loss is measured. Many studies use self-reported hearing loss, which tends to underestimate clinically significant impairment in older adults. Whether &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia+risk/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; can be reduced by treating hearing loss remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Population Attributable Fraction of Incident Dementia Associated With Hearing Loss," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2832869" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Otolaryngology—Head &amp;amp; Neck Surgery&lt;/i&gt;, researchers performed a prospective cohort study to calculate the population-attributable fraction of incident dementia associated with hearing loss in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; and to investigate differences by age, sex, race, and method of hearing loss measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from 2,946 community-dwelling adults aged 66 to 90 years without dementia at baseline were analyzed in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study. Participants were enrolled across four states. Data collection occurred between 2011 and 2019, with one hearing assessment conducted at visit six (2016–2017).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Hearing loss was measured both objectively using pure tone audiometry and subjectively via self-report. Dementia diagnosis was determined using a standardized algorithm incorporating neuropsychological testing, informant interviews, and medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinically significant hearing loss measured by audiometry was present in 66.1% of participants. During the follow-up period, 9.9% of participants with hearing loss developed dementia, compared to 4.7% of those with normal hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 32.0% (95% CI, 11.0%–46.5%) of dementia cases were statistically associated with any audiometric hearing loss, based on population-level modeling. Mild hearing loss (26–40 dB) had a population attributable fraction of 16.2% (95% CI, 4.2%–24.2%), and moderate or greater hearing loss (&amp;gt;40 dB) had a population attributable fraction of 16.6% (95% CI, 3.9%–24.3%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among participants aged 75 and older, the model indicates that up to about 31% of dementia cases may be linked to hearing loss. The 95% confidence range runs from -6 to 53%, indicating that the true figure could be far lower or even nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar, statistically uncertain patterns appeared for women (~31%, 6–47% range) and for white participants (~28%, -6–50% range). Overlapping confidence ranges offered no statistical difference between men and women or between races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-reported hearing loss was associated with a lower, though not significant, risk of dementia. No population attributable fraction was calculated for self-reported hearing loss due to a hazard ratio below 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings indicate that different methods of measuring hearing loss can lead to substantially different estimates of dementia burden. Future research may benefit from prioritizing objective hearing assessments to improve estimates of hearing-related dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of note, the study did not track hearing or hearing loss over time. What is described as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hearing+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; within the study context was lower than normal hearing ability measured at a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/single+point/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;single point&lt;/a&gt;, before any signs of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From India comes the story of three teen inventors who were looking to improve rural healthcare by creating a portable fridge that needed no electricity or coolant fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of their inspiration is a small, salt-cooled fridge that needs neither a power outlet nor a battery, but rather cools down passively as the salts dissolve in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_217125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-217125" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-217125" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-1024x768.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-326x244.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-80x60.jpg 80w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-265x198.jpg 265w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-696x522.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-560x420.jpg 560w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied-530x397.jpg 530w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/left-to-right-Dhruv-Chaudhary-Mithran-Ladhania-and-Mridul-Jain-supplied.jpg 1067w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-217125" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(left to right) Dhruv Chaudhary, Mithran Ladhania, and Mridul Jain, supplied&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling it “a fridge to bridge the world,” the Thermavault can use different combinations of salts to keep the contents at temperatures just above freezing or below it. Some vaccines require regular kitchen fridge temps, while others, or even transplant organs, need to be kept below freezing, meaning this versatility is a big advantage for the product’s overall market demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhruv Chaudhary, Mithran Ladhania, and Mridul Jain are all children of physicians or medical field workers in the state of Indore. Seeing how difficult it was to keep COVID-19 vaccines viable en route to countryside villages hours outside city centers in tropical heat, they wanted to create a better, portable solution to keeping medical supplies cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because salt molecules dissolve in water, the charged ions that make up the salt molecules break apart. However, this separation requires energy, which is taken in the form of heat from the water, cooling it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the teen team knew this, it remained a challenge to find which kind of salt would have the optimal set of characteristics. Though sodium chloride—our refined table salt—is what we think of when we hear the word “salt,” there are well over one-hundred different chemical compounds that classify as salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we did scour through the entire internet to find the best salt possible, we kind of just ended up back to our ninth-grade science textbook,” Chaudhary &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/3-teens-invented-salt-powered-202355256.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADLQzlrVJ4EVWAjKJuuqGs_Q7XOhl_3gT0_CUuGK3vpWQbnjLUsEP3X6wW4I-efdvDlpPajC94akGOk-CV2lfcNWB960AY8clLZh8F60jd9YCBNBxR5oUGS5BW4DOAbc8wBD4UUJDdPAngGQZwnDZ1EHM19acykz624kEs_Lq5Lg"&gt;told Business Insider.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the professors at the lab in the Indian Institutes of Technology where they were testing Thermavault’s prototype were experimenting with two different salts which ended up being the best available options, a discovery made after the three teens tested another 20, none of which proved viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIMILAR YOUNG MINDS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Teens Developed App That Identifies Mouth Cancer–Making Early Diagnosis Easy and Winning $50k for Their School" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/teens-developed-app-that-identifies-mouth-cancer-making-early-diagnosis-easy-and-winning-50k-for-their-school/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Teens Developed App That Identifies Mouth Cancer–Making Early Diagnosis Easy and Winning $50k for Their School&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were barium hydroxide octahydrate and ammonium chloride. The ammonium chloride alone, when dissolved, cooled the water to between 2 and 6 degrees Celsius (about 35 to 43 degrees Fahrenheit) perfect for many vaccines, while a dash of barium hydroxide octahydrate dropped that temperature to below freezing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been able to keep the vaccines inside the Thermavault for almost 10 to 12 hours,” Dr. Pritesh Vyas, an orthopedic surgeon who tested the device at V One hospital in Indore, said in a video on the &lt;a href="https://thermavault.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Thermavault website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing a prototype, the teens have already tested it in local hospitals, and are in the process of assembling another 200 for the purpose of testing them in 120 hospitals around Indore to produce the best possible scope of use and utility data for a product launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their ingenuity and imagination won them the&lt;a href="https://www.theearthprize.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; 2025 Earth Prize&lt;/a&gt;, which came with a $12,500 reward needed for this mass testing phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tiny but powerful is one way to describe chia seeds. These little black (sometimes white) seeds absorb water to form a thick gel that can boost the texture and nutrition of all sorts of foods, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8051021/overnight-oats-with-chia-seeds/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, pancakes, smoothies, puddings and more. In addition to their unique texture, 1 ounce of chia seeds provides an impressive 4.5 grams of protein, 10 grams of fiber and 5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They’re also an excellent source of minerals like magnesium and phosphorus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not everyone will experience negative side effects when including chia seeds in their diet. Still, it’s a good idea to be aware of what could happen and the risks of eating too many at once.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “One side effect of eating chia seeds on a regular basis that isn’t talked about enough is its potential to interfere with micronutrient absorption,” says &lt;a href="https://theoregondietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Megan Byrd, RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Oregon Dietitian. While the high soluble fiber content of chia seeds helps to minimize the absorption of fat and glucose (aka sugar), it can also lower the absorption of essential minerals like zinc, calcium and iron.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re deficient in any of these nutrients, Byrd recommends talking to your doctor or dietitian for personalized advice on whether to include chia seeds in your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7628198/the-1-food-to-help-you-poop-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best foods to relieve constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Their soluble fiber content helps add volume and bulk to stool, making it pass more easily. However, when added too quickly or without enough water, these tiny seeds may cause or worsen digestive issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Adding chia seeds too fast and without proper amounts of water can actually lead to bloating, gas and constipation or diarrhea,” says &lt;a href="https://katrinacoxrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Katrina Cox,&lt;/a&gt; a registered dietitian specializing in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Adding chia seeds and other high-fiber foods to your diet slowly and with plenty of fluids can help prevent digestive distress.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating chia seeds dry could pose a choking risk, thanks to their ability to absorb liquid and expand up to 27 times their weight in water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While it’s recommended to avoid eating large amounts of dry chia seeds, when mixed with water, chia seeds can be a beneficial solution for some people who experience dysphagia and require thickened liquids—just be sure to talk to a health care professional first.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are full of health-promoting nutrients, but if you are prone to kidney stones, specifically oxalate kidney stones, they might not be a good choice. Chia seeds are high in oxalates, compounds found in varying amounts in many plant foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One strategy to avoid this is pairing chia seeds with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-calcium-foods-that-arent-dairy-8661064" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-calcium food&lt;/a&gt;. Calcium binds to oxalate in the stomach, preventing it from being absorbed and transported to the kidneys.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you experience frequent kidney stones, talk with your health care provider about how to safely eat chia seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;

Certain compounds in chia seeds have blood pressure–lowering effects and antiplatelet properties that help prevent blood clots. While these properties are beneficial for many, they could interact with medications that already have these effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, because soluble fiber helps lower blood sugar by slowing digestion and preventing absorption of some carbohydrates, it may lead to low blood sugars when used along with certain diabetes medications. Talk to your health care provider before eating chia seeds if you take blood thinners, like warfarin, or medications to help manage blood sugar levels or lower blood pressure.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are no official recommendations for how many chia seeds to eat daily. However, guidelines around daily fiber intake may help you decide. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One ounce—about 2.5 tablespoons—of chia seeds provides 10 grams of fiber, or 35% of the recommended Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Some providers will recommend up to 5 tablespoons per day, but that is dependent on the person and tolerance levels. It is always advised to increase slowly and ensure proper water intake with the increase of fiber,” says Cox. People who have IBS or take blood sugar– or blood pressure–lowering medications may want to limit their chia seed consumption, unless otherwise directed by a health care professional.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you want the benefits without the gelatinous texture or are looking for a slightly different nutrition profile, try one of these chia seed alternatives:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground flaxseed:&lt;/strong&gt; Like chia seeds, ground flaxseed is a good source of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids and fiber—but with a nuttier flavor and smoother texture. “It’s versatile like chia seeds and can be placed in smoothies, oatmeal or as a vegan egg replacement,” says Cox. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemp seeds:&lt;/strong&gt; These little seeds provide just 1 gram of fiber per ounce, but have twice the protein of chia seeds. They’re also a great source of plant-based omega-3s and minerals like magnesium and zinc.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unlike chia seeds, they don’t absorb water. Instead, they provide a pleasant crunch to oatmeal, yogurt and salads.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psyllium husk&lt;/strong&gt;: Cox recommends psyllium husk as a high-fiber alternative to chia seeds. You’ll find more fiber in psyllium husk, with 1 ounce providing 12 grams, most of which is soluble. Research has found that taking psyllium husk supplements may improve cholesterol and blood sugar levels and manage constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a highly nutritious addition to many diets—they’re an excellent source of fiber, plant-based omega-3s and several essential minerals. But too much of a good thing can backfire. If you’re adding chia seeds to your meals, be sure to do so gradually, drink plenty of water and pay attention to how your body feels. And if you have digestive issues, a history of kidney stones or take certain medications, it’s a good idea to check with your doctor or dietitian before making these tiny seeds a daily staple.

&lt;p&gt;People who have IBS, a history of kidney stones or take medications to help manage blood pressure and blood sugar levels should consult with their doctor before adding chia seeds to their diet, recommends Byrd. Although rare, chia seed allergies are becoming more common, with documented cases occurring in people allergic to sesame.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Does eating chia seeds cause gas and bloating?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can contribute to gas and bloating, especially when eaten in large amounts or not soaked in liquid. “When my patients say they are struggling with bloating after eating a meal rich in chia seeds, we often discuss the importance of eating chia seeds that have been soaked in fluid so they don’t continue to grow in their digestive system,” says Brown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since chia seeds are high in phytoestrogens, there is some thought that eating more of them could reduce the large fluctuations in estrogen levels,” says Brown. However, research is ongoing and does not yet fully support this theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 bNYvfb cEegOB"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 gEpeSZ iTNirO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eWUqji"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-1400"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 bNYvfb cEnOje"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eWUqji"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-1401"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 bNYvfb cEnOje"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height.

Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eWUqji"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-1402"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 bNYvfb cEnOje"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 10:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPa2NYNjV3alZIUVFxdmdZdVlHbWNrMzNCTFBnbDNoT3M5anNLYV81QnZaaXNIS0NGR0I2YldqMXozRTBzVGdsb3hKZXBncmdxOTFpTXNmeHZvVXNLMzk4MmZHVExYLVFYOGsyWXhuaFRESzBERFV6QXc2T2I0VXdZVWMzOHFaaHR0dXF6bUw0dWFFN3JiQ25KVmJxdTB4WGgtMDhkamw3ZEFoUTdtbkpyNg</guid></item><item><title>帕尔马干酪可以代替您的蛋白质棒吗？ -食品和葡萄酒 | Can Parmesan Replace Your Protein Bar? - Food &amp; Wine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBpeWhhSHowTS1WclFBaEZ2NXZXUW10WEpyYU1vbV9PcGhRU0dmSGozcUVJQVpBMFpSODdsVXpHUjhVLXFCT1pZOTF2Z0JIV0dUc2FYc3BJTGtQZ2RWQTljQkxsbkxvR1o2MDlRd0hacnA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;TikTok users are swapping protein bars for bites of Parmigiano Reggiano, drawn by its high protein content — about 10 grams per ounce.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;True Parmigiano Reggiano is aged and highly regulated, giving it a denser protein concentration compared to other cheeses like mozzarella or brie.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts confirm it’s a solid protein source but advise moderation due to its fat and sodium levels, and suggest pairing it with fiber-rich foods for balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

There’s protein-packed ice cream, grass-fed &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/what-are-chomps-8753980" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;meat sticks&lt;/a&gt; (with a design that's much sleeker than Slim Jims), and of course, a vast array of protein bars and powders. There’s even a new source of &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/solein-protein-8771371" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protein pulled from thin air&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On TikTok, however, some creators are taking a simple but unexpected approach to reach their protein goals: They’re biting into blocks of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese as if they’re apples.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I’m over protein bars — switching to full blocks of parmesan,” one user captioned the &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rachelkcabeza/video/7484757861185211678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;footage&lt;/a&gt; of herself chowing down on a full-size wedge. This is far from the only TikToker to eat parm like a stone fruit, and many &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@convinoboard/video/7404152522975284486" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;other creators&lt;/a&gt; cite the cheese’s high protein content as the reason they’ve opted for it as a snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If videos on TikTok are to be believed, then Parmigiano Reggiano contains about &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@barebyevelyn/video/7487682896338177310" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;10 grams&lt;/a&gt; of protein per ounce or &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lenadia.nijhuis/video/7407760063068179744" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;33 grams&lt;/a&gt; of protein per three ounces. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, as we all know, social media isn’t a definitive source of health and nutrition information, so we consulted experts to determine if parmesan is the protein-rich snack you need in your life — plus, exactly how many grams of protein you can expect to reap per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-protein-is-in-parmesan-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How much protein is in parmesan cheese? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; True Parmigiano Reggiano, which is heavily regulated and can be identified by the dotted letters spelling out “Parmigiano Reggiano” on its rind, will indeed have around 10 grams of protein per ounce. Registered dietician &lt;a href="https://www.emilymorgannutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Emily Morgan Martorano&lt;/a&gt; tells Food &amp;amp; Wine this is significantly higher than cheeses like mozzarella or brie, which average around four to six grams of protein per ounce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One ounce of cheese doesn't translate to a large volume, so this umami-forward ingredient can deliver a lot of protein in a relatively small serving. The most precise way to measure one ounce is with a scale, but you can also visualize this as about one-third of a cup of grated cheese.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most wedges of Parmigiano Reggiano will have their weight printed in ounces on the packaging, which will give you a good idea of how much protein is in the entire piece.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is one important distinction to note. Many people equate parmesan and Parmigiano Reggiano, but an item labeled simply as “parmesan” was likely not crafted in a specific region of Italy under the strict production standards that must be met to earn the title of Parmigiano Reggiano, which include being aged for at least 12 months.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Parmesans are made in the &lt;em&gt;style&lt;/em&gt; of Parmigiano Reggiano, but they are less regulated and can vary more in production, which also means they may differ slightly in protein content. However, they are likely to have a high protein content that's very similar to their Italian ancestor. &lt;a href="https://www.target.com/p/belgioioso-parmesan-cheese-wedge-8oz/-/A-86023078" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;For example, BelGioioso parmesan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most common parmesans in the United States, also has roughly 10 grams of protein per ounce. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To verify the protein content of a parmesan you’re not familiar with, simply check the nutrition label on the back.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-does-parmesan-have-so-much-protein"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why does parmesan have so much protein? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Parmigiano Reggiano only contains three ingredients: milk, rennet and salt,” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/cheezytalkwithmadelyn/?hl=en" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Madelyn Varela&lt;/a&gt;, a cheesemonger and former cheesemaker, tells Food &amp;amp; Wine. “The star of the show — the milk — is going to be where all of the protein comes from.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not just the ingredients of Parmigiano Reggiano that contribute to its protein richness. Its high protein content is also attributed to the lengthy aging process this cheese undergoes. All Parmigiano Reggianos must be aged for a minimum of one year, and the majority are aged for at least two years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “During this time, moisture decreases and the cheese becomes more compact, making the protein more concentrated per serving,” Morgan Martorano explains. This long aging process also breaks down the milk’s lactose, rendering the cheese lactose-free.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Varela, the production process that earns Parmigiano Reggiano its name “is very labor intensive.” She explains that cheesemakers first process and coagulate the milk, turning it into a solid mass of cheese curds. They cut the curd into tiny pieces, cook it until firm, and place it into cheese molds.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “That is only the beginning,” Varela emphasizes. The cheese is then aged for a year — with careful monitoring of course — after which it’s graded. “If it passes the test, it will go on to age at least another year or longer,” the cheesemonger explains.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; American cheesemakers can replicate this process, and American parmesan is often less expensive for state-side buyers. Plus, many parmesans are vegetarian, unlike true Parmigiano Reggiano, which contains animal rennet, an enzyme found in animal stomachs that helps milk turn into cheese. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’d prefer to eat your parmesan in light dustings over pasta, you can look to several other cheeses to meet your protein goals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Morgan Martorano suggests Swiss (which has about eight grams of protein per ounce), cheddar (around seven grams per ounce), part-skim mozzarella (roughly seven grams per ounce), &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/cottage-cheese-recipes-tik-tok-8703529" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; (13—15 grams per half-cup serving), and ricotta (around 14 grams per cup). Precise nutrition information will vary depending on the product, so check nutrition labels for more exact estimates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to try something new, Morgan Martorano offers some advice for navigating grocery store aisles in search of high-protein cheese.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Look for harder, aged cheeses,” she says, noting that these products typically contain less moisture and more protein per ounce. “My rule of thumb is, for something to be considered high in protein, it should have 10% protein for the calorie amount. For example, 100 calories’ worth of cheese should have 10 grams of protein to be considered high in protein.” In general, low-fat cheeses will contain fewer calories for more protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While eating cheese is a great way to up your protein intake, you might not want to bite into a whole wedge like an apple. “Cheese can be a convenient and delicious way to boost protein, especially for snacks or vegetarian meals,” says Morgan Martorano. “That said, it’s important to be mindful of portion sizes due to the saturated fat and sodium content in many cheeses.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a more balanced snack, Morgan Martorano recommends pairing cheese with fiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain crackers. Which sounds to us like the perfect accoutrements for a &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/lifestyle/kitchen/best-charcuterie-boards" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;charcuterie board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

These symptoms often intensify with time but could be lessened through specific dietary habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is consensus among experts that a Mediterranean-style diet plays a key role in warding off brain decay. This diet, which can vary from one region to another, generally consists of a large intake of vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, beans, cereals, grains, fish, along with unsaturated fats like olive oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have investigated the wider &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; benefits of this particular diet, but one study, conducted by the National Institutes of Health, tracked over 7,750 people for between five to ten years to pick apart which elements make it so beneficial, reports &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/foods-reduce-risk-of-dementia-30261037" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study participants filled out food frequency questionnaires, and their cognitive functions including memory, language, and attention were evaluated through phone tests. From the gathered data, researchers pinpointed dietary components most effective at decreasing the likelihood of cognitive impairment and decline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31484399" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harvard Health has identified fish as the "single most important dietary factor" in a study that linked its consumption to a reduced risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why fish?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A publication in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7103640/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; sheds light on the subject, explaining: "Fish is an important source of omega-3 fatty acids that are present in the membranes of the brain tissue."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, at the other end of the spectrum, there are some foods which could be contributing to brain deterioration.

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you're searching for what foods you should be incorporating into your everyday diet, you should consider foods, such as:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wholegrains (three or more servings a day)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, cabbage, spring greens, kale and salad leaves (one or more servings a day)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Other vegetables (one or more servings a day)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nuts (on most days)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Beans and lentils (three or more servings a week)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Berries, including blueberries and strawberries (two or more servings a week)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Chicken or turkey (two or more servings a week)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fish (one or more servings a week)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Olive oil (as the main oil or fat you use)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Wine (no more than one small glass a day – more than this and it becomes more likely to harm health than help it)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to diet, maintaining physical activity is also key to minimising the likelihood of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/?utm_source=newslettersignupfooter" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;b&gt;If you want ideas and inspiration to plan your next UK adventure plus selected offers and competitions, sign up for our 2Chill weekly newsletter here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOZXEzMHdkeXMzWjVvT2lVUjI4MmdmVXBSNWNWNzRBaDdkZlNiQTg2MXF3Y241OV9WWklTejJZdXlhMjJ3U3dpV2k1TkRrY3lhRWZkSXRIcndBSzJDM0pfRElxNHVoMC0wd1dTbTRtMVFkcDR4WXRldjk5Tm1jZkpicUxyQWV6Z9IBiwFBVV95cUxPbzZ6RzdCMHJ4OFRldnhwWU5jMmxsN0FaVENZY0NsR0ZrY1NrdWFkYmNnQlNEaU5nV3NDVU41dlAzbXJjMHg5Tkx3RGxqZmhWTXV0MXh6WFVoN1FQUlZjZGRjUDZsRlVEU0kxVEVfOFZuT1ZpOFdQb0JhWHM4UWowbGNMNDBvZ3BaQVVR</guid></item><item><title>短期饮食试验旨在失败- statnews.com | Short-term diet trials are designed to fail - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNZnNFa0gxbk1QekNnSlZpa1d2WUlhQmpxeGo2Q2xDdXJDVzVscms0VDBjb202V3VURldqV3owV3R4NmNiaHZCSzFfV09USFdRSDlUSXE5RmdTX3B2cUNQeFlqZ3JEcWdDdUVTazNIaktXZENZTjRMTGxmZUk5NkpYd2JGMUJRdXR2cWpYcmZuN1cta1FNSXV4VFBzM2VJQkQ2aHIwUjFqNTNTbjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a clinical trial with sedentary, overweight adults. One group is assigned to remain sedentary, the other to undergo intensive physical training with daily runs, calisthenics, and sports. After a week or two, the training group would probably feel sore and tired, and their endurance might be reduced. But we wouldn’t conclude that physical activity is bad for health. Clearly, we’d need a better, longer study to see the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is the exact approach taken in the clinical trials at the heart of the $170 million Nutrition for Precision Health program, as we consider in a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/389/bmj-2024-082963" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;paper published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the BMJ, the British Medical Journal.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05701657" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nutrition for Precision Health&lt;/a&gt;, which is part of the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/03/all-of-us-research-program-funding-congress-21st-century-cures-act/"&gt;NIH’s All of Us precision-medicine initiative&lt;/a&gt;, has an ambitious goal: to use artificial intelligence to determine what type of diet works best to prevent chronic disease for each person. To do this, research teams from across the country intend to study several thousand volunteers on three different diets. One diet is conventionally healthy, including vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Another diet is highly processed, with lots of sugar, refined grains, and meat. The third is low-carbohydrate, based on high-fat foods and strictly limiting sugar and grains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The investigators go to great lengths to maintain scientific rigor, providing the volunteers fully prepared meals to help them stick to the diets. Up to 1,000 will be admitted as inpatients and kept under continuous observation, to ensure they eat nothing but the prescribed diets. A huge amount of data will be collected using advanced technologies with complicated names, like “microbial metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, targeted and untargeted metabolomics,” and an “Automatic Ingestion Monitor” system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is, with all the costs and complexity, the diets can’t last long — just two weeks each. Two weeks is simply not enough time to tell us anything meaningful about how diet affects obesity and the other chronic diseases plaguing Americans today.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Consider &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31105044/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the trial&lt;/a&gt; comparing “ultra-processed” and “unprocessed” diets, upon which the new research program is designed in part. During two-week inpatient stays, 20 volunteers initially ate about 600 calories more a day on the ultra-processed diet. However, this effect shrank by about 25 calories each day throughout the trial. At this rate, the diets would no longer differ after another two weeks. In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39267249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;replication trial&lt;/a&gt;, the effect of the ultra-processed diet weakened after just one week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Myriad factors affect how much a person eats on any particular day, among them &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153875/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;utensil size&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29679981/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;plate color&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32693846/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;room temperature&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19501755/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;social setting&lt;/a&gt;. But we don’t eat with small spoons on colorless plates in a warm room with strangers in the hopes of losing much weight — these effects are transient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Does ultra-processed food cause obesity? Maybe, but we’ll never know from short-term trials like these.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To complicate matters further, the Nutrition for Precision Health trials use a cross-over design, in which all volunteers consume all three diets in succession over several months. This design is efficient and lets investigators examine how people vary in their individual responses. But there is a big catch: The effects of one diet can bleed into the next, creating a statistical mess.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine what might happen with that hypothetical short-term physical activity study, if it were run as a cross-over. One group would get the vigorous activities first, becoming tired and sore. Then, during the subsequent sedentary condition, they’d rest, recover, and experience delayed benefits of exercise as the temporary side effects wore off. But the group assigned the sedentary condition first could become even less fit than they started, making the subsequent physical activities even more likely to cause side effects. This is what’s called a carry-over effect — exercise makes being sedentary &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; better than it really is, whereas being sedentary makes exercise &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; worse. As every statistician knows, carry-over effects can invalidate the trial.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Short-term diet trials &lt;a href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(23)72806-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are highly prone&lt;/a&gt; to these types of bias, because it takes weeks to months for the body to adapt to a major change in nutrients. For this reason, people starting a very-low-carb diet often experience fatigue and other symptoms — it’s called “&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326276#treatments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;keto flu&lt;/a&gt;.” With volunteers selected from the general population — that is, with habitually high intakes of carbohydrate — bias inevitably works against the low-carbohydrate diet.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These trials are not only inconclusive, but also potentially misleading by making a healthy diet look bad and an unhealthy diet look good. We must do better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Can specific diets support metabolism, calm inflammation, slow aging, or protect the brain? Nutrition  studies with all the bells and whistles can help answer these basic questions, but they must be long enough to allow the body to adapt, with diets and wash-out periods (the time between successive diets) of at least two months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, there is no substitute for long-term trials. We’d never approve a drug for obesity, diabetes, or any chronic disease based on two-week or even two-month data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there is no substitute for government support of nutrition science, as we’ve seen from the success of publicly funded research with tobacco-related diseases, HIV/AIDS, and birth defects, among other breakthroughs. Whereas Big Pharma can easily raise the $1 billion that may be needed to develop just one drug for just one health condition, no big company profits by preventing disease through diet. Only government can fill this gap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the recent budget cuts, every research dollar must count. Funding at the level of Nutrition for Precision Health could support several large-scale trials of low-carbohydrate, ultra-processed, and other diets over at least two years. These studies would lay a solid foundation for future dietary guidelines and patient care recommendations. (The government previously sponsored a slew of major low-fat diet trials, &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/2006/02/09/low-fat-diet-not-a-cure-all-womens-health-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; basically &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1212914" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;failing&lt;/a&gt; to show any benefits, but not one low-carbohydrate diet trial of comparable magnitude.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve been debating diet for decades, even as rates of diet-related chronic diseases continue to surge. To solve this public health crisis, we need definitive research from high-quality studies. Short diet trials will never measure up to this task.&lt;/p&gt;

Besides playing a key role in sexual and reproductive health, it strengthens bones, keeps skin supple, regulates sugar levels, increases blood flow, lowers inflammation and supports the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“You name the organ, and it promotes the health of that organ,” said Roberta Brinton, a neuroscientist who leads the Center for Innovation in Brain Science at the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But appreciation for estrogen’s more expansive role has been slow in coming. The compound was first identified in 1923 and was henceforth known as the “female sex hormone” — a one-dimensional reputation baked into its very name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Estrogen” comes from the Greek “oestrus,” a literal gadfly known for whipping cattle into a mad frenzy. Scientifically, estrus has come to mean the period in the reproductive cycles of some mammals when females are fertile and sexually active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Women don’t enter estrus; they menstruate. Nevertheless, when researchers named estrogen, these were the roles it was cast in: inducing a frenzy and supporting female sexual health. Now, estrogen is gaining recognition for what may be its most important role yet: influencing the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Neuroscientists have learned that estrogen is vital to healthy brain development but that it also contributes to conditions including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s. Changes in estrogen levels — either from the menstrual cycle or external sources — can exacerbate migraines, seizures and other common neurological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highs and lows of blood glucose aren't just an energy rollercoaster; they could be a key to detecting diabetes risk early and spare you a needle prick or two.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Tokyo have identified a simple, noninvasive method for assessing blood glucose regulation—an essential factor in diabetes risk. Their approach, based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, could improve early detection and risk assessment for diabetes without relying on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; and expensive or complex procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;i&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often called a "silent epidemic," diabetes is an increasingly prevalent global health concern, with significant health and economic consequences. Early detection of impaired glucose regulation—an intermediate stage between normal blood &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glucose+levels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glucose levels&lt;/a&gt; and diabetes—is essential for preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional diagnostic tools, however, often miss early signs because they rely on periodic blood samples rather than continuous monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Traditional diabetes tests, while useful, do not capture the dynamic nature of glucose regulation under physiological conditions," said Shinya Kuroda, a professor at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Science and co-author of the current study.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find a more practical alternative, the team turned to CGM, a wearable technology that continuously tracks glucose levels in real time, providing a clearer picture of blood glucose fluctuations in everyday life. Their goal was to identify a CGM-based method for estimating glucose handling capacity, which maintains stable levels, without invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed 64 individuals without a prior diabetes diagnosis, using a CGM device, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), and clamp tests that are used to assess insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. They then validated their findings with an independent dataset and mathematical simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their analysis showed that AC_Var, a measure of glucose-level fluctuations, strongly correlates with the disposition index, a well-established predictor of future &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diabetes+risk/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the researchers' model, which combines AC_Var with glucose standard deviation, outperformed traditional diabetes markers—such as fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and OGTT results—in predicting the disposition index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By analyzing CGM data with our new algorithm, we identified individuals with impaired glycemic control—even when standard diagnostic tests classified them as 'normal,'" said Kuroda. "This means we can potentially detect issues much earlier, creating an opportunity for preventive interventions before diabetes is diagnosed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also showed that the method was more accurate than conventional diagnostic indicators in predicting diabetes complications such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coronary+artery+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt;. To facilitate broader access to this approach, the research team has developed a web application that allows individuals and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+providers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care providers&lt;/a&gt; to easily calculate these CGM-based indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our ultimate goal is to provide a practical, accessible tool for widespread diabetes screening," Kuroda said. "By enabling early detection of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glucose+regulation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glucose regulation&lt;/a&gt; abnormalities, we hope to prevent or delay disease onset and reduce long-term complications."&lt;/p&gt;

A child admitted to a Dallas hospital in the late 1980s had been sick for days with a fever, rash and no clear diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s measles,” said Kline, an infectious disease expert who recognized the signs from treating hundreds of cases in Uganda earlier in his career. None of the pediatricians or nurses had considered it. They’d never treated a case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades later, the same unfamiliarity with a disease thought to be eliminated could ripple through emergency rooms in Louisiana as hospitals prepare for the possibility of local cases amid a nationwide outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With two cases identified in Louisiana and vaccination rates slipping below the threshold for community protection, hospitals are preparing by educating their staff on symptoms and reviewing protocols for isolation and contact tracing. Many health care providers in Louisiana have never seen a case outside of a textbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of them are too young to have actually seen a case with their own eyes,” said Kline, now physician in chief at Manning Family Children’s in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana's first case was announced by the state health department on Saturday in an unvaccinated adult who had recently traveled internationally and was treated for measles at a New Orleans-area hospital. That person is not hospitalized and is now in isolation. As officials located others the patient had been in contact with, they discovered a second case in a New Orleans-area adult who is no longer infectious, health officials said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;First cases confirmed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious airborne virus that spreads through coughing, sneezing, or even breathing near others. Symptoms usually begin 7 to 14 days after exposure and include high fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a rash that spreads from the face downward. Complications can be severe, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana had three travel-associated measles cases in 2024. Prior to that, the last recorded case was in 2018. That patient had traveled to Louisiana from Europe to attend Wrestlemania and sought care at an urgent care and ER before being diagnosed at Tulane Hospital, highlighting the potential of a missed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“For people who aren't familiar with it, or don't have it on their mind, they can make a mistake,” said Dr. John Schieffelin, professor of pediatrics at Tulane University and pediatric infectious disease chief at Manning Family Children’s. At that hospital, triage nurses and urgent care staff have been placed on high alert for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health recently ended statewide mass vaccination efforts and directed staff to refrain from recommending specific vaccines and to instead tell residents to consult their physicians, part of a broader policy change under Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Abraham said Monday that the state has been promoting the measles vaccination on the LDH website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recommend it for our children, and it is a good vaccine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparing for local spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the latest case was travel-related and no pediatric cases have been reported in Louisiana this year, local spread remains a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d be naive to think that we won’t be seeing cases in children here in Louisiana,” Kline said, pointing to the state's proximity to Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;where nearly 600 measles cases have been reported&lt;/a&gt; this year. Two unvaccinated school-aged children have died there, and at least 62 people have been hospitalized. The outbreak has spread to nearby states of New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kara Ward, a critical care and emergency medicine physician in New Orleans, said that even a single case can be operationally disruptive. Hospitals must notify public health authorities, isolate the patient, assess the vaccination status of anyone who may have been exposed in waiting areas, and implement special cleaning procedures due to the virus’s ability to linger in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It puts more strain on the limited resources,” Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ochsner Health, the state’s biggest health system, is continuing to educate staff on measles symptoms and likelihood based on travel history and vaccination status as the Texas outbreak has grown, said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, system medical director of patient safety. If a patient is suspected to have measles, they are given a mask and isolated. The hospital contacts the state health department, and those authorities decide whether a test is necessary. The test is processed by a state lab.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccine coverage declines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine — part of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) shot — is about 97% effective after two doses. Widespread vaccination eliminated measles in the U.S. in 2000, but resurgences have occurred in communities with declining vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Louisiana, MMR vaccination rates among kindergartners dropped from about 96% in 2020 to 92% in the 2023–2024 school year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Several parishes, including Livingston, East Baton Rouge, St. Tammany, Acadia, Lafayette, Terrbonne, Union, Ouachita and West Carroll &lt;a href="https://analytics.la.gov/t/LDH/views/SchoolImmunizationDashboard/Kindergarten?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" target="_blank"&gt;have rates below 90%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have sort of dipped below that threshold of herd immunity in Louisiana,” said Schieffelin. “In some areas, we could start seeing some ongoing transmission if it gets introduced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the first MMR vaccine is typically given at 12 to 15 months and again around kindergarten, some pediatricians are getting requests to give it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monday after Louisiana confirmed a measles case, Hales Pediatrics in Uptown New Orleans received a wave of calls from concerned parents, said Dr. Nora Oates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children as young as six months can receive an early dose of the measles vaccine, though they will still need two standard doses later, as infants’ immune systems often don’t mount a full response at that age.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="8"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the early dose is typically reserved for infants traveling to or living in areas with active outbreaks, Oates said she would “have no reservations about giving it” if a parent was concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who are unvaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history can also get immunized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No specific treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles, said Kemmerly, just supportive care. Severe cases might be managed with steroids or vitamin D. For immunocompromised people, immune globulin is available if administered shortly after exposure. The measles vaccine can also prevent infection or lessen illness severity if given within 72 hours of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Our best treatment for measles is prevention,” Oates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="9"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated measles patients is hospitalized. One in 20 children develops pneumonia, the most common cause of measles-related death in young children. One to three of every 1,000 children with measles will die from complications, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite misinformation about alternative treatments circulating, there are not a lot of treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Once you come down with measles, you're just along for the ride,” Kline said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Complications can be severe, including pneumonia, brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louisiana had three travel-associated measles cases in 2024. Prior to that, the last recorded case was in 2018. That patient had traveled to Louisiana from Europe to attend Wrestlemania and sought care at an urgent care and ER before being diagnosed at Tulane Hospital, highlighting the potential of a missed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“For people who aren't familiar with it, or don't have it on their mind, they can make a mistake,” said Dr. John Schieffelin, professor of pediatrics at Tulane University and pediatric infectious disease chief at Manning Family Children’s. At that hospital, triage nurses and urgent care staff have been placed on high alert for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health recently ended statewide mass vaccination efforts and directed staff to refrain from recommending specific vaccines and to instead tell residents to consult their physicians, part of a broader policy change under Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Abraham said Monday that the state has been promoting the measles vaccination on the LDH website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We recommend it for our children, and it is a good vaccine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparing for local spread&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the latest case was travel-related and no pediatric cases have been reported in Louisiana this year, local spread remains a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d be naive to think that we won’t be seeing cases in children here in Louisiana,” Kline said, pointing to the state's proximity to Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;where nearly 600 measles cases have been reported&lt;/a&gt; this year. Two unvaccinated school-aged children have died there, and at least 62 people have been hospitalized. The outbreak has spread to nearby states of New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kara Ward, a critical care and emergency medicine physician in New Orleans, said that even a single case can be operationally disruptive. Hospitals must notify public health authorities, isolate the patient, assess the vaccination status of anyone who may have been exposed in waiting areas, and implement special cleaning procedures due to the virus’s ability to linger in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It puts more strain on the limited resources,” Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ochsner Health, the state’s biggest health system, is continuing to educate staff on measles symptoms and likelihood based on travel history and vaccination status as the Texas outbreak has grown, said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, system medical director of patient safety. If a patient is suspected to have measles, they are given a mask and isolated. The hospital contacts the state health department, and those authorities decide whether a test is necessary. The test is processed by a state lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccine coverage declines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine — part of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) shot — is about 97% effective after two doses. Widespread vaccination eliminated measles in the U.S. in 2000, but resurgences have occurred in communities with declining vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Louisiana, MMR vaccination rates among kindergartners dropped from about 96% in 2020 to 92% in the 2023–2024 school year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Several parishes, including Livingston, East Baton Rouge, St. Tammany, Acadia, Lafayette, Terrbonne, Union, Ouachita and West Carroll &lt;a href="https://analytics.la.gov/t/LDH/views/SchoolImmunizationDashboard/Kindergarten?%3Aembed=y&amp;amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y" target="_blank"&gt;have rates below 90%&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have sort of dipped below that threshold of herd immunity in Louisiana,” said Schieffelin. “In some areas, we could start seeing some ongoing transmission if it gets introduced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the first MMR vaccine is typically given at 12 to 15 months and again around kindergarten, some pediatricians are getting requests to give it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monday after Louisiana confirmed a measles case, Hales Pediatrics in Uptown New Orleans received a wave of calls from concerned parents, said Dr. Nora Oates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children as young as six months can receive an early dose of the measles vaccine, though they will still need two standard doses later, as infants’ immune systems often don’t mount a full response at that age.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="8"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the early dose is typically reserved for infants traveling to or living in areas with active outbreaks, Oates said she would “have no reservations about giving it” if a parent was concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who are unvaccinated or unsure of their vaccination history can also get immunized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No specific treatment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles, said Kemmerly, just supportive care. Severe cases might be managed with steroids or vitamin D. For immunocompromised people, immune globulin is available if administered shortly after exposure. The measles vaccine can also prevent infection or lessen illness severity if given within 72 hours of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Our best treatment for measles is prevention,” Oates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="9"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated measles patients is hospitalized. One in 20 children develops pneumonia, the most common cause of measles-related death in young children. One to three of every 1,000 children with measles will die from complications, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Severe%20complications%20in%20children%20and,low%2Dbirth%2Dweight%20baby" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite misinformation about alternative treatments circulating, there are not a lot of treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;

In England, 31% of men and 26% of women have high blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Half of the people with high blood pressure are not diagnosed or receiving treatment. In England alone, there are thought to be more than five million people that are undiagnosed. Among the 27,000 participants in the study, 19 per cent reported using one or more blood pressure-raising medications, and 4 per cent reported using multiple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly one-quarter (24%) of women with high blood pressure reported using a blood pressure raising medication compared with 14% of men. Cardiologist &lt;span&gt;Dr John Vitarello, at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre in Boston, said: "These are medications that we commonly take--both over-the-counter and prescribed medications - that may have the unintended side effect of raising blood pressure and could have adverse effects on our heart health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We know that high blood pressure leads to cardiovascular disease, stroke and death and even small increases in blood pressure can have meaningful impacts on cardiovascular disease. &lt;span&gt;Based on our findings, we need to be more aware of polypharmacy (the use of multiple medications by a single patient) in older adults who also have the highest burden of high blood pressure."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Vitarello said the findings suggest, in some cases, rather than treating high blood pressure with more medications, there may be opportunities to lower blood pressure by deprescribing or substituting safer medications. &lt;span&gt;For example, there may be other classes of medications to treat the same condition that have less impact on blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research was presented at the American College of Cardiology's 70th Annual Scientific Session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 08:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNbkM5U2s2bXNaNC1zcmtoQWpLd0RjOUNWbjlOMDZVb1lIVDRYc0d4VlVxRjd3R2VaTHZNY2oweklwTmtZc1J0aGJlNGFablBFcmN6QTBPemdYM3RNTmZJUWdncm5fRkdfX0xRTjdMemVBVEFDMFNMdXlMdHJXb0hnNlhFdlhvNGJ0Y25FRUZWSdIBlAFBVV95cUxNMzRCelJWOHZ6S1hfM1k2blA2MThIQnJ2QzlDVlFONXRJNTYzQlhzUElwQmIxUHRiYXJEM1ZiZ3JKRzZLLUl2VjlzcUNQNDZLT050N0c5dE1ZQmdWM2wyMi1oV3Q1NDN4OWRsMkFtNW0tZ2NCc1NzSjhGeUpkdW5EUkZ2Wl9BRU0xaTN3WmpXYi1ncVhp</guid></item><item><title>是否存在天然等同于Ozempic的物质？ -与Sanjay Gupta博士一起追逐生活- CNN音频播客- CNN | Is There a Natural Equivalent to Ozempic? - Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta - Podcast on CNN Audio - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQV0l3c2xZOGV3S0xpbk0wOS0weXBuVWQzLU91YmYwMW5tdGxHZUFXcGFUenNGVWFaM2FsZHJTVWd4NWlFQlNrQy1Mc3poSzRiNl92M1RoTDZRa0NDX0F2Yl9pS19ZXzMzNHJtWU1XM0VxNFFkN2RkYmx2d0wzV3d3U3FLcW5Kd2V1dThyb1ppcHNwMC1YQlU5cA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

              Hey there! Welcome to Paging Dr. Gupta. This is the place where your questions drive the conversation. And, I have to say I really love hearing from you. Thank you for sending in so many of your questions. Let's get right to it:
            &lt;/p&gt;

              'Hi, Dr. Gupta, this is Nina from a suburb of Chicago. My question is about GLP-1. As I was listening to one of the podcasts, it got me wondering if there are natural ways to stimulate GLP-1. I was just curious if it's something that your body makes or something your body produces, I believe, after you eat. So are there natural ways for that to be done other than taking the shots?Thank you so much. Bye bye.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:00:53
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Okay, thank you. First of all, Nina, it sounds like your question specifically is where does the GLP-1 hormone come from and what are the natural ways to boost it? I have to tell you, this is a fascinating topic. I worked on a documentary about this topic. I traveled to Denmark to talk to the scientists who helped develop these drugs. I talked to the scientists at Eli Lilly, who'd also developed these drugs, and I talked a lots and lots of patients. And I'll tell you I learned a lot. So let's start with some of the basics. First of all, GLP-1. That's actually short for glucagon-like peptide. You hear people talking about peptides? This is one of them. Glucagon-like peptide-1, it is probably best described as a post-nutrient hormone. What does that mean? Substances that the human body releases after consuming food, post-nutrient. They do several things. These hormones will stimulate your pancreas to make insulin. They will slow down how quickly food actually moves into your intestines, and they also activate areas in the brain that make you feel full or satiated. And I gotta tell you, as a neuroscientist, it was this last mechanism that I found so fascinating. When you eat, you should feel full. But for some people, turns out they never really feel full, no matter how many calories, no matter much energy they've consumed. Instead they have what is now being described as this constant sort of maddening food chatter in their brains. Even as they're eating a meal, they're already thinking about their next meal. They never really truly feel satiated. Just imagine what that must be like. And I think it's part of the reason they continue to eat far more calories than they require. So for them, the GLP-1 medications can quite literally quiet those voices in their head. So what we're talking about is naturally occurring. We all make these hormones, but some people don't make enough, and that's why they don't feel full. If you want to go back even one step further, glucose or sugar, that is the body's main source of energy. So during digestion, food is broken down into smaller nutrients, ultimately absorbed via our gut and our circulatory system, our blood, then take those nutrients around the body. Glucose in particular transported from the bloodstream to inside our cells by insulin. Insulin has helped facilitating transferring the glucose inside the cells. So by taking glucose out of the blood stream and into the cells, it is then turned into energy. Now insulin helps keep blood sugar in check in a certain range, but you're probably thinking of diabetes right now. People who have diabetes, they are more resistant to the effects of insulin, or they can't make enough insulin, or it's a combination of both. Either way, the end result is that glucose stays in the blood and cells miss out on their sources of energy. So if you don't have enough insulin you may have plenty of glucose, plenty of energy in your body, but it's staying in the blood. It's not getting into the cells. And that's where GLP-1 can come into play. GLP-1, as well as a second hormone called GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide -- You don't need to remember all this -- but GLP-1 and GIP are hormones that stimulate the secretion of insulin after food is consumed. Okay, so that helps get the glucose into the cell. I hope that all makes sense so far. So not only does GLP-1 and GIP stimulate your pancreas to make more insulin, they also again slow down how quickly food moves into your intestines. That's why people feel constipated sometimes taking these medications. They're not moving the food along as well. That helps them feel full after they eat a meal and helps that food actually become more easily absorbed. And then as I mentioned earlier, they also activate the area in the brain that makes you feel full or satiated. So let me just repeat that. These hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, they will stimulate your pancreas to make more insulin. That allows glucose to get inside the cells. Number two, they slow down how quickly food moves through your intestines. That gives you a sense of fullness. And they also work on the brain, specifically on an area of the brain called the satiety center, the satiation center. That'll make you feel full after you eat a meal. So the GLP-1 drugs are basically doing this, and they are synthetic versions of a hormone that we should already make. Now, your main question though, was let's say you don't wanna take these medications, are there natural ways to boost this hormone? And what I'll tell you is fiber. I will just throw this word out there, fiber. Most Americans, frankly, most people, at least in the developed world, do not get enough fiber. What we know is that high fiber diets tend to release more natural GLP-1. There's little doubt that, look, for most people regular exercise and just eating right is gonna be the best strategy for weight loss and overall health. But I gotta say, when I worked on the documentary, I realized that for certain people, no matter how attentive they are to their overall health, no matter how wise they are about their food choices or how much activity they incorporate into their lives, they still gain weight. They still become overweight and obese. And they have that constant maddening food chatter in their brains. So you can create more natural GLP-1 and I think a high fiber diet is probably one of the best ways to do it. In addition to healthy lifestyle choices overall. But you gotta keep in mind that for some people, they just don't make enough GLP-1, regardless. So I would strongly suggest increasing the fiber in your diet no matter what, because most people simply aren't getting enough. That should help increase the amount of natural GLP-1. But if you're somebody who is obese, if you meet the criteria for these medications, maybe they're an option. For most people, they're not. But maybe they're an option for you. You should talk to your doctor about this. You know, working on the documentary for me really made me understand, I think, obesity as a disease. We know diabetes is a disease. You're not making enough insulin or the insulin you are making is not working well enough. For certain people with obesity, not everybody, but for certain people of obesity, it's another hormone they don't have enough of, GLP-1. And as a result, they don't tell their brains that they feel full after a meal. And for, again, certain people, these medications might provide a good option for people who are just trying to improve their health overall. And as part of doing that, want to increase their GLP-1 levels, think about fiber. Incorporate more fiber into your diet. Now when we come back, we're going to talk about health misinformation and the best ways to stay informed nowadays. Okay, we're back, let's get to our next question, this one from Texas.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Hey, Tina, thank you so much for calling. First of all, it's true. You know, the government is cutting back on many of its public health agencies and their communications departments. And, you know, there is a lot of medical myths and conspiracy theories out there. So it's increasingly difficult to get accurate information. Look, I think that at CNN Health, we spend a lot time on this. We have criteria: We cite studies that are published in academic journals that are evidence-based and that have been peer-reviewed. So it's not just the author or set of authors that are writing the paper, but then they are given to independent peer reviewers to try and determine, is this accurate information? Is it reproducible information? Is it evidence-based? And those are the types of journal articles that we really focus on. You can look for those yourself. But admittedly, studies can be hard to vet and they can be harder to dissect. And that's when you often need to turn to trusted sources that can help communicate that information to you. Again, it's very difficult to disentangle anything from politics nowadays, I realize that. But we did a longer episode on health misinformation earlier this year. Laurel Bristow, who's an infectious disease researcher, I think she gave us some pretty great tips.
            &lt;/p&gt;

If you're somebody who is not in the scientific community and you're looking at social media, you know, first of all, if somebody is eliciting a super emotional response in you, that's not great science communication. If they are selling a product to you, if they have invented a problem that they are going to sell you the cure for, that's a huge red flag. If something sounds too good or too bad to be true, it probably is. Unfortunately, science and the scientific process is kind of boring. It's very rare that we have like a huge breakthrough that's really exciting. So most of the stuff you're gonna hear from legitimate scientists is not gonna be like elicit a super strong emotion from you. So, I think those are all really important things to look out for.
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'If things sound too good to be true, they probably are. Science is the process of looking at things over time, so it's important to know that information often moves between being updated and outdated. And I also think the last point that Laurel makes, if information out there is seemingly designed to elicit a strong emotion from you, then, you know, beware. Beware. It's not to say for sure that that's misinformation, because sometimes health content can be super emotional. But if it just seems designed to elicit an emotion from you, to make you angry, to make you fired up for some reason, beware of that. When it comes to medical information and public health information, I  think that people often think of that as a hard science, that two plus two is going to equal four, always. But the thing about medical science and public health is that, again, things do change over time. It's an evolving science. So at any given time, scientists try and present the best information they have, but it may change over time, so there is a humility involved as well with regard to presenting good health information. So bottom line, Tina, ask yourself, where did this information come from? Can you really identify where the information came from? Is the information actually provided? A lot of times people will just make statements without any links to where they're getting those statements or those ideas from. Seek out the primary source. So, and even when you're reading a story on CNN Health, click on the links to the research that we are citing. Test it out for yourself. Don't just take our word for it. Stay critical. And most of all, Tina, thank you for your question because you care about health info and accuracy. So do we. It's really truly what we do. And that's all the time we have for today's episode.

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most efforts to protect kids from the harms of technology focus on delaying smartphones and social media for children and getting phones out of schools. As a tech policy expert, I fully endorse these solutions, but one key and often overlooked part of the equation is what &lt;em&gt;parents&lt;/em&gt; must do about their own technology use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need only look around at a playground today to see it. Kids run around while their parents stare down at screens in their hands, oblivious to the noise, chaos, and needs of their children. Children tug on parents’ arms or scream for attention, and the parents often seem not to register it. At least not until the child throws a fit big enough to snap them back to reality. Maybe you’ve seen a playground like this one, or seen parents pushing a child in the stroller or through the grocery store, eyes glued to their phones. If we’re honest with ourselves, we’ve all been guilty of being this parent at one time or another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While digital technologies’ addictive effects are more harmful to the developing brains of children, adults are not immune. Parents’ compulsive screen behaviors hurt kids. In fact, a relatively new field of research focuses on this problem, which researchers call “technoference”: the phenomenon of digital technology interfering with parent-child relationships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the results of this research so far are not good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-technoference"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Technoference.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that technoference negatively affects a child’s language learning, social and emotional development, and behavioral and emotional regulation, increasing attention-seeking behaviors, emotional outbursts, and rates of anxiety and withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take language learning. According to some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/07/mother-on-instagram-baby-fell-down-stairs-parental-phone-use-children"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt;, the children of adults who are frequently on their phones start school at a deficit, without the expected language or interpersonal skills for a 5-year-old. And children who attempt to engage with their parents but don’t get a response are less likely to initiate that interaction going forward—leading to the loss of critical learning opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These losses accumulate over time. Researchers &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6185759/"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; that when phone use displaces parent-child verbal and nonverbal interactions, children receive less parental “scaffolding”—the just-adequate-enough support for a child to perform a new skill on his own—especially in developing their behavior regulation. The long-term result is a dysregulated child who struggles with behavioral difficulties, including tantrums, not being able to sit still, and getting easily frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents on phones are also &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317346084_Impact_of_Parents_Mobile_Device_Use_on_Parent-Child_Interaction_A_Literature_Review"&gt;less&lt;/a&gt; sensitive and responsive to their child’s bids for attention.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;And often, when children do manage to interrupt a parent, they are &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2702123.2702199"&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with hostility rather than engagement and affection. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24616357/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that parents are more likely to ignore children when using devices than when they are distracted with non-devices, whether reading a book or preparing a meal. Devices make parents uniquely less available—and that lack of attention can result in risky attention-seeking behavior in children. In other words, while handing a child a screen undermines their self-control, the &lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt; staring down at a screen seems to have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even babies feel the impact. When parents are looking down at a device, they are generally displaying a still face. This can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28944600/"&gt;distress&lt;/a&gt; an infant, because a still face—rather than an emoting one—displays a lack of attention, attention that infants rely on for their sense of security and emotional regulation. As a result, the infant will increasingly try to get the mother’s attention—and, if that fails, the infant will &lt;a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/research-still-face-experiment/"&gt;withdraw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, with teens. One &lt;a href="https://wheatley.byu.edu/report-teaching-by-example"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from Brigham Young University’s Wheatley Institution found that “depression was higher in teens when their parents reported higher levels of personal social media use.” In fact, “adolescents are nearly four times as likely to be depressed if their parents are high level social media users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies, toddlers, children, and teens. All are negatively impacted by parental device use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most dangerous of all, however, is that the technology blinds its users to these negative effects. While we are staring down at our screens, we cannot see the little eyes watching us. We don’t notice the needs right in front of us—and we don’t notice that we are forming the desire in our children for screens, too. When we spend so much time looking at, scrolling, and texting on our phones, our kids will want to copy us—after all, children naturally want to do what adults do. My four-year-old wants to wash the dishes in the sink because he sees me washing the dishes and my two boys are always asking my husband when they will get to shave like Daddy. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071205102433.htm"&gt;Yale study&lt;/a&gt; found that young children, in fact, “over-imitate” adults, meaning that even when children are warned &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do what they see an adult doing, they are often unable to avoid reproducing those adult actions. This study is sobering when it comes to our phones. Even when we tell our children not to look at phones, if we don’t follow the same command, it will be extremely difficult for children to not imitate our behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forging-a-new-relationship-with-our-phones"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forging a new relationship with our phones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, then, should parents do to free ourselves from the addictive pull of digital devices, so that we can reengage with our children?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can start by separating ourselves from devices when kids are awake and we are with them. Have a designated phone box for your family so that at the end of the day, all phones go in the box and the family can be together without interruption. Place a basket near your door and put your phone in it when you come home and mute your phone and tablet so that you won’t be tempted by it. Inform your colleagues, friends, and family that you will not be responding to texts, calls, or emails for specific periods of time when you are with your children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to live by the principle, “If I am with my children, then I am not on my phone.” Work to develop the skill of being mentally and emotionally present with your children instead. If they are young, get down on the floor and play with them, and involve them in what you are doing, whether in the kitchen or with chores. Make eye contact and engage them as much as possible. When you do need to do something on your phone while your children are present, resist the texting takeover of communication. Instead, try to make more voice calls, so they can hear you and know what you are doing. This also allows you to model good conversation skills for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also dumb down your phone, making it less appealing to pick up in the first place. Turn off notifications, put your phone in grayscale, and delete as many apps as possible, especially social media and other messaging apps. You can even take the internet browser off your phone entirely. If these changes sound daunting, you can always start smaller: Focus on identifying and eliminating at least one or two of the most tempting aspects of your phone for the long-term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, don’t be afraid to consider alternative phones to a smartphone. I made the switch two years ago, first to a Light phone and then more recently to a Wise phone, and while there are certain inconveniences, I don’t regret it for a second. I am freed from distraction and present for the things that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another step to remove yourself from the pull of tech is to establish rhythms of regular breaks from your phone, social media, the internet, and any digital technology. Consider a phone-free Saturday or Sunday as a family. Regular breaks will help restore a healthier relationship with technology. A recent &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/2/pgaf017/8016017?login=false"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that among adults who took a break from their smartphones by blocking the internet for just two weeks, 91 percent felt better after the break. “People had better mental health, better subjective well-being and better sustained attention,” &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/24/nx-s1-5304417/smartphone-break-digital-detox-screen-addiction"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Adrian Ward, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the study’s authors.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, taking regular breaks and being more physically distanced from our phones means going “old-fashioned” in our individual and family practices. Technology is always replacing something, so the best way to reduce tech dependence is to simply revert to the analog options. Have a family calendar on the wall. Use a notepad and pen to jot notes to yourself or to-do lists. Get an alarm clock for everyone to have next to their bed. Wear a real watch so that your phone isn’t your watch. Buy a family camera to use for pictures and videos so your phone isn’t your camera. Though these may feel like inconveniences in our fast-paced and hyperconnected world, you may find that returning to analog options benefits you and your family in ways you couldn’t have predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, by adopting practices to help us put our phones down, we model for our children what healthy technology use as an adult looks like—and open their eyes to the wonder of the world around them, away from screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children will value what we value. Let’s show them we value people more than phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Michigan researchers have discovered that a single dose of a psychedelic compound can enhance cognitive flexibility—the brain's ability to adapt to changing circumstances—for weeks after administration, potentially revolutionizing treatments for depression, PTSD, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study, titled "Single-dose &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychedelic/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychedelic&lt;/a&gt; enhances &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+flexibility/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt; and reversal learning in mice weeks after administration," published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Psychedelics&lt;/i&gt;, demonstrates that mice treated with a single dose of 25CN-NBOH, a selective serotonin 2A receptor agonist, showed markedly improved performance in reversal learning tasks compared to control groups when tested two to three weeks after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What makes this discovery particularly significant is the sustained duration of cognitive benefits following just one psychedelic dose," explains Professor Omar J. Ahmed, the study's senior, corresponding author from the University of Michigan's Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We observed enhanced learning adaptability that persisted for weeks, suggesting these compounds may induce lasting and behaviorally meaningful neuroplasticity changes in the prefrontal cortex."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an innovative automated sequential learning paradigm, researchers measured how effectively mice could adapt to rule reversals—a standard test for cognitive flexibility. The psychedelic-treated mice demonstrated superior adaptability compared to saline controls, with enhanced task efficiency, higher percentages of correct trials, and increased reward acquisition during the reversal phase.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Implications for brain science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results complement existing cellular research showing psychedelic-induced structural remodeling in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prefrontal+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; but uniquely demonstrate sustained cognitive benefits persisting long after the immediate effects of the drug have dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As interest in psychedelic medicine continues to grow, this research raises intriguing questions about how psychedelics might reshape neural pathways governing flexible thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could these compounds potentially reopen critical periods of brain plasticity? What &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+mechanisms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; underlie these long-lasting cognitive improvements? How might the timing and frequency of administration affect long-term neuroplasticity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The current study focused on the long-term effects of a single psychedelic dose. A key question is what happens with two, three, or even twenty doses taken over several months. Is every additional dose increasingly beneficial for flexible learning or is there a plateau effect or even a negative effect of too many doses? These are important questions to answer next in the quest to make psychedelic medicine more rational and mechanistic," according to Dr. Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sex differences and clinical potential&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found that both male and female mice showed significant improvements in cognitive flexibility, suggesting the potential broad applicability of psychedelic therapy across biological sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The most striking aspect of our findings is that these cognitive benefits were measured 15–20 days after a single psychedelic administration," notes Elizabeth J. Brouns, first author of the study. "This suggests that a single dose of a psychedelic isn't just temporarily altering perception, but potentially inducing lasting beneficial changes in brain function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's automated behavioral task represents a significant methodological advance for evaluating flexible learning, enabling researchers to efficiently evaluate cognitive flexibility in future investigations of psychedelic compounds. This high-throughput approach could accelerate the development of targeted psychedelic therapies for specific cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, there’s no looking back. They are versatile tiny seeds with a powerful nutrient profile. So much so that they have the power to transform your health even if you eat soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a gastroenterologist, recently shared on social media that consuming a tablespoon of chia seeds daily can be the best thing to do for your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a reel uploaded on his personal handle, Dr. Sethi explains how chia seeds can help reset gut health, prompting an investigation into the effects of a two-week chia seed regimen on metabolism. Here are several benefits of incorporating soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Provides fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny, nutrient-rich seeds can improve digestion due to their high fiber content, helping regulate bowel movements for those struggling with constipation, though adequate water intake is necessary to prevent bloating. High fibre in food helps in better movement of stools and prevent constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that consuming chia seeds can significantly improve gut health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keeps you energetic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaked chia seeds provide sustained energy throughout the day through their combination of protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates. Therefore, they can prevent the energy slump during the day and keep you away from fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydrate you better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summertime may wreak havoc on your hydration levels. Too much sweating and harsh summer sun may cause water loss and severe dehydration. Chia seeds' ability to absorb water and form a gel-like substance aids in maintaining longer hydration, particularly beneficial for those who exercise or live in hot climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Helps with weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to lose weight without much effort? Start taking soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks in your diet. Their expanding property in the stomach promotes feeling full for extended periods, potentially aiding in weight management, though overconsumption could lead to excess calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rich in omega&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The omega-3 fatty acids in chia seeds contribute to heart health, potentially reducing bad cholesterol and heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heals inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is the invitation to many diseases like liver problems and even cancer. The antioxidants present in chia seeds offer benefits for skin protection against inflammation. Consuming soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks may also prevent aging and promote strong, healthy hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks can lead to many health benefits. However, it's important to eat them in moderation and drink plenty of water. Try adding them to smoothies, yogurt, or salads for a simple and healthy boost or you may also soak them in water overnight, add a few drops of lemon in the morning and drink as a quick fat burner protein rich drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 04:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
