This latest case is not the same form, and treatments have certainly advanced since that time. That said, I wanted to know what pneumonic plague is, how it’s spread and what its symptoms are. How is it diagnosed, and what treatments are available? What can people do to reduce the risk of contracting the disease? And how much should people be worried about plague?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Pneumonic plague is one of three types of plagues that are caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F17782-plague&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727398100%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=2eS3FL1Pz26EPW3LnYfIENdL%2FCkJwl1vgUkYjcPVL4Y%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;type of plague&lt;/a&gt; someone has is classified based on where the bacteria are concentrated. Bubonic plague infects lymph nodes. Septicemic plague is when the bacteria cause a whole-body infection through the bloodstream, and pneumonic plague affects the lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; It depends on the type of plague. Bubonic plague is typically caused by the bite of an infected &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2024%2F07%2F05%2Fhealth%2Fplague-human-risk-explainer%2Findex.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727415565%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=frtW1Y%2BLSAgysz6NOX%2B6kwGgdGKL9XWiAuZw8Dp2wHY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;rodent flea&lt;/a&gt;. It can progress to septicemic plague, which can also arise as a result of handling infected animals such as rats and cats. Cats and other animals can contract the plague through eating rodents or through the bite of fleas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6iorqt000z3b6n907743m2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pneumonic plague develops when the bacteria spread to the lungs in someone who started out with bubonic or septicemic plague. It can also occur when the bacteria are directly transmitted through airborne droplets — if someone inhales droplets containing the Yersinia bacteria that are coughed by an infected person or animal. This is the only form of the plague that can be spread from person to person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; People infected with all three forms develop common infectious symptoms including fever, headache, chills and weakness. Those with bubonic plague have one or more swollen and painful lymph nodes, also called buboes. In septicemic plague, the seeding of bacteria to other parts of the body can cause multi-organ failure and total body shock. Pneumonic plague is characterized by a rapidly progressing pneumonia with symptoms of shortness of breath, cough and chest pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Most Americans do not live in areas where plague can be found. For those in Western US states where plague has occurred, there are &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coconino.az.gov%2FCivicAlerts.aspx%3FAID%3D3242%26fbclid%3DIwY2xjawLfXHRleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFCd3hlUjY2M1ZGNURMRFdFAR5cdhAbD4Nab71-FQNNDDI_CXVgccQw2SMLR5OknCEoxkTUi1wDajEe0TzLvQ_aem_WYG09QZujnbgF13qssTFqQ&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C56b895ea96eb4de6f08c08ddc4aa421b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638882957727620660%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=2f%2BipoOjDDGfhrUOB2Y0XQJ4V5mx4g2QvV3fkTY5KEI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;several actions&lt;/a&gt; they can take to reduce their potential exposure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001m3b6nh9fpncjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, avoid contact with wild animals. Do not handle wild rodents. Do not touch sick or dead animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001n3b6nplcoduve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, because most cases are associated with rodents, people should prevent rodent infestation by storing pet food in rodent-proof containers and removing brush and trash around homes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001o3b6n5wz990i4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third, avoid fleabites. Wear long sleeves and use insect repellent containing DEET if you are hiking, camping or working outdoors. Keep fleas away from household pets by using veterinarian-approved flea control products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001p3b6nmtk0tvv8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fourth, keep pets out of areas known to be inhabited by wild rodents. Be on the outlook for illnesses in domestic animals, especially indoor-outdoor cats, and seek prompt veterinary care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd6irnq2001q3b6njo0zl5rc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All of this said, I think it’s important to be reminded of how uncommon plague is. People who live in areas where plague has been found should take preventive measures, and clinicians should ask about travel history to these areas. Most Americans, though, do not need to be concerned about plague based on this single recent case in Arizona.

It affects not only individuals but also deeply impacts caregivers and families, often creating emotional, financial, and logistical challenges over time. In its early stages, it might look like simple forgetfulness. But over time, it can take away even the most basic abilities, like recognising loved ones or getting dressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most symptoms begin after age 65, but the condition starts developing in the brain years, sometimes even decades, before that. As life expectancy rises, so does the number of people affected. Over 6 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9502739/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;million &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;older adults in the U.S. live with Alzheimer’s, and that number is expected to grow dramatically. This makes prevention even more important. Growing research shows that our lifestyle choices; what we eat, how we sleep, and how we move, can make a real difference in protecting brain health long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes Alzheimer’s disease? Key risk factors to know&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease doesn’t have a single known cause. Instead, it likely develops from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that damage the brain over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-causes-alzheimers-disease" data-type="tilCustomLink"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;, the risk of Alzheimer’s doubles every five years after age 65. Ageing is linked to the buildup of abnormal proteins like beta-amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics and family history also play a role. People with a parent or sibling with Alzheimer’s are at higher risk. In particular, carrying the APOE ε4 gene variant has been linked to late-onset Alzheimer’s, but it doesn’t guarantee you’ll develop the disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI), especially repeated or severe head injuries, may trigger long-term brain changes that increase Alzheimer’s risk later in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart and vascular health matters, too. High blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease can all impair blood flow to the brain, accelerating damage. Managing these conditions may reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health is another factor. Chronic stress and depression have been linked to changes in brain structure and function, especially in memory-related areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoking and toxin exposure can raise the risk by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain. Quitting smoking at any age can help lower this risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributing factors include low education levels, social isolation, and unhealthy lifestyle habits like poor diet or inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having these risk factors doesn’t mean you’ll develop Alzheimer’s, but they can increase your chances. Many of them, especially lifestyle-related ones, are preventable or manageable through early action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recognising the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While occasional forgetfulness is a normal part of ageing, Alzheimer’s disease involves ongoing cognitive and behavioural decline that interferes with daily life. These changes typically worsen over time as brain cells are progressively damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/10_signs" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-symptoms-and-diagnosis/what-are-signs-alzheimers-disease" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, early signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory loss that disrupts daily routines, such as forgetting recent conversations or appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty completing familiar tasks, like using appliances or managing bills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving challenges, including trouble planning or following steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language issues, such as struggling to find the right words or follow conversations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disorientation, with confusion about time or location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor judgment, including neglecting hygiene or falling for scams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mood and personality changes, such as irritability, anxiety, or social withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms don’t always indicate Alzheimer’s; they can result from other conditions like depression or medication side effects. A medical diagnosis is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later stages, people may lose the ability to communicate, walk, or care for themselves. Research shows that early detection and intervention can improve quality of life and slow disease progression. If signs appear, consult a healthcare professional promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11 lifestyle changes that could help prevent Alzheimer’s&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s often begins to develop decades before symptoms appear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;now shows that up to 45% of dementia cases could be delayed or prevented by addressing modifiable lifestyle factors throughout life. Here’s how targeting key areas can help protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improve blood flow&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy blood flow supplies the brain with oxygen and nutrients. Studies show that reduced cerebral blood flow is linked to Alzheimer’s and mild cognitive impairment. Promising evidence from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2020/exercise-improves-memory-boosts-blood-flow-to-brain.html?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;UT Southwestern&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; demonstrated that older adults with memory issues who engaged in one year of regular aerobic exercise experienced a nearly 47% increase in blood flow to memory-related brain regions and improved cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stay mentally active as you age&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building what’s known as “cognitive reserve” helps delay dementia symptoms by strengthening neural networks through lifelong learning and activity. Research from Alzheimer’s Research UK shows that engaging in new, mentally challenging activities throughout life lowers the risk of dementia by up to 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reduce inflammation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is a known factor in neurodegeneration. Diseases like gum inflammation contribute to increased dementia risk. A nutrient-rich, anti-inflammatory lifestyle, focused on whole foods, regular exercise, stress control, and good oral hygiene, helps protect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Recognize genetic risk but take action&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying the APOE-ε4 gene increases Alzheimer’s risk, but lifestyle still matters. The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Lancet Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reports that even those with high genetic risk can significantly reduce dementia risk through healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid head trauma&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head injuries can increase the risk of dementia later in life. Simple preventive steps, like wearing helmets during sports, using seat belts, and avoiding risky behaviors like texting while driving, can help protect brain health long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minimize exposure to toxins&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic exposure to environmental toxins such as heavy metals, air pollution, alcohol, and certain medications affects cognitive health. Reducing exposure, eating detox-supportive foods, staying hydrated, and using tools like saunas can help reduce toxic burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritize mental health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression, stress, and anxiety are associated with brain changes and increased dementia risk. Approaches such as therapy, mindfulness, journaling, or meditation can support mental wellbeing and protect cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support immunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic illnesses that impair immunity (e.g., infections, autoimmune diseases) can accelerate brain aging. Ensuring good vitamin D levels, a balanced diet, and routine healthcare helps strengthen immune defenses that support brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Balance hormones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones like thyroid, estrogen, and testosterone affect memory and mood. Age-related hormone declines can influence cognition. Regular hormone screenings allow early detection and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoid “diabesity”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining obesity and type 2 diabetes, “diabesity” is strongly linked to dementia. Losing weight, managing blood sugar, and lowering systemic inflammation are key to reducing cognitive decline risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ensure quality sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep clears beta-amyloid and supports cognitive processing at night. Even one night of sleep deprivation can raise amyloid levels by 5%, while chronic poor sleep disrupts the toxin-cleaning “glymphatic” system and elevates Alzheimer’s risk.

That’s why we love to hear about workouts that maximize the benefits — better mood, sleep, muscle strength and blood pressure, anyone?— and doesn’t take &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; long. This one, called “Japanese walking” can be done in just 30 minutes a day. And as an added bonus, summer can be the perfect time to take a walk in nature (which has its own mental health benefits) while also hitting your exercise goals. We’ve even scheduled a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/22/japanese-walking-questions-answers/" target="_blank"&gt;Live Chat on Tuesday at noon Eastern&lt;/a&gt; to answer your questions about how to use walking to get in shape. Please join us! But before that …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;This week’s must-reads:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="6VOS4GDES5ACNFDGLCSBNZVCDU" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5 things doctors want you to know &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/15/glp1-ozempic-nutrition-muscle-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;before you take a GLP-1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you use a fan to sleep?

One particular technique, known as interval walking training (IWT) or “Japanese walking,” is getting renewed attention after going viral on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORKFK5FQYRH4FNN7F6XGKASSSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a 2007 study, volunteers did three minutes of fast walking followed by three minutes at a slower pace, for 30 minutes per day at least four days per week. “One of the most surprising findings was that IWT markedly increased physical fitness and decreased blood pressure after the 5-month intervention whereas these improvements were not observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking group,” Shizue Masuki, a researcher on the team and professor at Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine in Matsumoto, told our reporter, Alexandra Frost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QD6CIJTJLNBUXMPBUEGLPULFHY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QD6CIJTJLNBUXMPBUEGLPULFHY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;You might be fooling yourself about peanut butter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TOA62XB73VFNRLIZ3SWLXK35GE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Optimizing your protein intake can be tricky. It’s not just &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;how much protein&lt;/a&gt; you eat that matters, but when you eat it, and the foods that you get it from. You may even have higher protein needs than you think depending on your overall health, your age, your activity levels and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RXY3DJDFUZG33NU46LVFUVT2MQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nutrition reporter Anahad O’Connor spoke to experts and analyzed studies to identify the most common protein pitfalls. For example, you have probably heard that peanut butter has a lot of protein. But in reality, it’s a better source of fat than protein, said Jose Antonio, a professor of health and human performance at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. “The fat is good for you. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re getting a lot of high-quality protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YELXDYSLY5GE7IOUBO54HS23KM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To find out more about the mistakes that people make when it comes to eating protein, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/16/protein-how-much-do-i-need/" target="_blank"&gt;read our story here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GQU2LZM3U5BLHBP4ISI3JZU52I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GQU2LZM3U5BLHBP4ISI3JZU52I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What I eat in a day to boost my gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7GISK2JFOJDPXFRCUDOHSFGQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Ask a Doctor columnist is Trisha S.

&lt;p data-start="83" data-end="416"&gt;Crafting a plant-powered menu is one thing; turning that menu into all-day energy is another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="83" data-end="416"&gt;I’ve met plenty of vegans (myself included) who checked every ethical box yet still felt like an extra on &lt;em data-start="285" data-end="303"&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="83" data-end="416"&gt;If that’s you, chances are you’re tripping over one—or several—of the seven missteps below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="83" data-end="416"&gt;Let’s fix them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="423" data-end="451"&gt;1. Under-eating calories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="453" data-end="826"&gt;“Many new vegans find themselves constantly snacking or feeling fatigued… you’re just not eating enough calories or protein or fat or some combination thereof,” notes dietitian Sapna Vora in an interview with &lt;a href="https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/mistakes-new-vegans-make"&gt;&lt;em data-start="662" data-end="680"&gt;Plant Based News.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="828" data-end="1064"&gt;Plant foods are champions of nutrient density but lightweights in calorie density. Swapping a chicken-and-rice bowl (600 kcal) for a kale-and-quinoa bowl (350 kcal) looks heroic on Instagram—until your blood sugar free-falls by 3 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1066" data-end="1400"&gt;My own wake-up call came during a photo-shoot week in Portland. I stuffed myself with smoothie bowls, felt “full,” then spent the afternoons yawning behind the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1066" data-end="1400"&gt;A calorie tracker revealed I’d been undershooting my needs by 600 kcal a day. Once I added an extra scoop of peanut butter and a fistful of walnuts, the slump vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1402" data-end="1418"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1402" data-end="1416"&gt;Quick fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="1419" data-end="1663"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="1419" data-end="1578"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1421" data-end="1578"&gt;Anchor every meal with a calorie-dense core: oats + nut butter at breakfast, hummus + whole-grain pita at lunch, or tofu curry with coconut milk at dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="1579" data-end="1663"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1581" data-end="1663"&gt;Don’t fear healthy fats; one tablespoon of olive oil adds 120 effortless calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1670" data-end="1697"&gt;2. Skipping vitamin B12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1699" data-end="2074"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12"&gt;The Vegan Society&lt;/a&gt; puts it bluntly: “To get the full benefit of a vegan diet, vegans should either eat fortified foods two or three times a day or take a B12 supplement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2076" data-end="2323"&gt;B12 keeps your red-blood-cell factory humming; stall that assembly line and oxygen delivery plummets—hello, chronic fatigue. Because plants don’t make B12, relying on kombucha “trace amounts” is like banking on rainfall to fill your swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2325" data-end="2341"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2325" data-end="2339"&gt;Quick fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="2342" data-end="2554"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2342" data-end="2459"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2344" data-end="2459"&gt;Pick one: 2–3 servings of B12-fortified foods daily &lt;strong data-start="2396" data-end="2402"&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; a 250–500 µg chewable supplement several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2460" data-end="2554"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2462" data-end="2554"&gt;Check labels: some plant milks contain as little as 0.4 µg per cup—far below the 2.4 µg RDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2561" data-end="2584"&gt;3. Overlooking iron&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2586" data-end="2875"&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/iron/"&gt;Harvard’s Nutrition Source&lt;/a&gt; reminds us that iron-deficiency anemia is “the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, causing extreme fatigue and lightheadedness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2877" data-end="3219"&gt;Non-heme iron (the plant kind) absorbs at roughly 10 % the rate of heme iron. Translation: that heroic spinach salad needs a strategy. I learned this the hard way after a routine blood panel flagged low ferritin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2877" data-end="3219"&gt;A squeeze of lemon over my lentils and a daily Brazil-nut-and-raisin trail mix nudged levels back into range within three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3221" data-end="3237"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3221" data-end="3235"&gt;Quick fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="3238" data-end="3524"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3238" data-end="3341"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3240" data-end="3341"&gt;Pair iron-rich beans, lentils, or tofu with vitamin C sidekicks—citrus, bell peppers, strawberries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3342" data-end="3429"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3344" data-end="3429"&gt;Keep coffee and tea an hour away from iron-focused meals; tannins block absorption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="3430" data-end="3524"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3432" data-end="3524"&gt;Consider a gentle iron bisglycinate supplement if bloodwork—and your doctor—say you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3531" data-end="3563"&gt;4. Living on processed carbs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3565" data-end="3836"&gt;Vegan convenience foods rescue road-trips but sabotage steady energy. On a recent Japan swing, I subsisted on konbini (convenience-store) white-bread sandwiches and soy lattes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3565" data-end="3836"&gt;Delicious? Absolutely. Sustaining? Not so much. By day three my brain felt like mushy edamame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3838" data-end="4073"&gt;Ultra-processed carbs spike glucose, trigger insulin crashes, and leave you hunting for the next wrapper. Whole-grain, fiber-rich staples release energy slowly and deliver minerals the body converts into ATP (think quinoa’s magnesium).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4075" data-end="4091"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4075" data-end="4089"&gt;Quick fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="4092" data-end="4375"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4092" data-end="4196"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4094" data-end="4196"&gt;Build a “half-plate” habit: fill 50 % of your plate with vegetables or fruit before adding starches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4197" data-end="4299"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4199" data-end="4299"&gt;Swap refined grains for intact ones—bulgur instead of couscous, steel-cut oats instead of instant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4300" data-end="4375"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4302" data-end="4375"&gt;Batch-cook beans; they’re the slow-burn logs in your metabolic fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4382" data-end="4408"&gt;5. Forgetting omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4410" data-end="4642"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but brain fog often masquerades as tiredness. Short-chain ALA (from flax or chia) must convert to long-chain DHA/EPA—an inefficient process. Low DHA can dull mental sharpness and deepen perceived fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4644" data-end="4660"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4644" data-end="4658"&gt;Quick fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="4661" data-end="4902"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4661" data-end="4736"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4663" data-end="4736"&gt;Grind two tablespoons of flaxseed daily and sprinkle it over breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4737" data-end="4827"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4739" data-end="4827"&gt;Consider an algae-derived DHA/EPA supplement (250–500 mg combined) a few times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="4828" data-end="4902"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4830" data-end="4902"&gt;Balance your omega-6 intake by moderating sunflower, corn, and soy oils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4909" data-end="4939"&gt;6. Burning the candle late&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4941" data-end="5153"&gt;Diet isn’t the only drain. During a recent album review marathon (music blogging roots die hard) I stretched editing sessions past midnight. Even with immaculate macros, five-hour sleep windows trashed my energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5155" data-end="5292"&gt;Chronic sleep debt disrupts hunger hormones, pushing you toward sugary fixes, and tanks mitochondrial efficiency—the body’s battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5294" data-end="5310"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5294" data-end="5308"&gt;Quick fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5311" data-end="5548"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5311" data-end="5404"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5313" data-end="5404"&gt;Guard a non-negotiable eight-hour sleep window—yes, even during &lt;em data-start="5377" data-end="5394"&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; binges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5405" data-end="5472"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5407" data-end="5472"&gt;Dim screens 90 minutes before bed; blue light delays melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5473" data-end="5548"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5475" data-end="5548"&gt;Trial magnesium glycinate (200–400 mg) if muscle tension keeps you wired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5555" data-end="5582"&gt;7. Flying blind on data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5584" data-end="5831"&gt;Guesswork is a poor coach. Without periodic check-ins—blood tests, food logs, even a basic mood tracker—you’re steering blindfolded. I book a comprehensive panel every six months; seeing my B12 or ferritin trendlines keeps me accountable and calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5833" data-end="5849"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5833" data-end="5847"&gt;Quick fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5850" data-end="6144"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5850" data-end="5961"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5852" data-end="5961"&gt;Schedule an annual (or biannual) panel covering B12, ferritin, vitamin D, thyroid panel, and omega-3 index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5962" data-end="6059"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5964" data-end="6059"&gt;Use a simple app to log meals for a week each quarter; patterns (good and bad) jump out fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="6060" data-end="6144"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6062" data-end="6144"&gt;Treat supplements as—wait for it—supplements, not excuses for a sugar-fueled diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6151" data-end="6167"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6151" data-end="6167"&gt;The takeaway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6169" data-end="6451"&gt;Fatigue isn’t inevitable on a vegan path; it’s a sign something’s out of tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6169" data-end="6451"&gt;Feed your calories, respect your micronutrients, curb the ultra-processed creep, and honor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6169" data-end="6451"&gt;Tweak these seven levers and that perpetual yawn can become the steady hum of plant-powered momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I wasn't eating. I was sleeping a lot and just not myself. I was just out of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just six days after the diagnosis, he was rushed through for major surgery where doctors cut out part of his skull to remove 90 percent of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But during the surgery, one of his major blood vessels spasmed, causing a stroke and now leaving him struggling to move anything on the left side of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Branden Newman is pictured above with his wife Joanna. He was diagnosed with glioblastoma in May this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glioblastomas can be diagnosed at any age and are particularly difficult to treat because the tumors can grow tentacles deep into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 12,000 people are diagnosed with the disease every year, and only five percent of them survive longer than five years, estimates suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are rising, experts say, including a slight uptick among those under 40 years old, but physicians are stumped as to the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman went to his primary care doctor, and then the emergency room after his wife Joanna, who works in a physician's office, recommended that he got checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Branden had a migraine for six days,' she told local news station &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.kcentv.com/article/news/local/overcome-this-salado-couples-love-story-becomes-battle-against-rare-brain-cancer/500-b3daed9d-9b07-45fe-9783-54ee8de855ad"&gt;KCENTV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He's always had migraines, but this one was different because it lasted so long and he was nauseous and the light really bothered him.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing the moment she found out the diagnosis, she said: 'My boss came and got me out of the [operating room] and told me that they found a mass on Branden and I lost it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was diagnosed with a 'mass' on May 2, and underwent a craniotomy to remove it on May 8, a surgery where doctors cut open the skull to access the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To treat the cancer, doctors opened his skull and removed 90 percent of the tumor from his brain. The above photo is from after the surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has endured radiation for six weeks followed by weekly chemotherapy for six months to eliminate the tumor cells, and is now undergoing daily chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman is also taking perampanel, an anti-seizure medication that can have anti-tumor effects, and gabapentin, also an anti-seizure drug that has been linked to improved survival among people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said that during the surgery, they tried to remove the tumor from around his middle cerebral artery,&lt;span&gt; one of the three major arteries that supply blood to the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But during the procedure, the blood vessel spasmed, causing a stroke and damage to the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was initially unable to move his left side after waking up from surgery but has now recovered enough movement to walk again. He is still having trouble with his left arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman revealed his diagnosis amid Glioblastoma Awareness Day on July 16, which aims to make more people aware of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of the disease include a persistent headache, vomiting, loss of appetite, double vision and changes in mood and personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say the overwhelming majority of headaches do not represent tumors, but those who are concerned should speak to their primary care providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The pair, from Texas, are childhood sweethearts having met in 2000 when Branden was 13 years old and she was just 11 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman and his wife were childhood sweethearts, having met when he was 13 and she was just 11 years old while on a camping trip. The pair dated in high school and married in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But shortly after the wedding, the pair faced a crisis when Newman's wife was unexpectedly diagnosed with a non-cancerous spinal cord tumor that left her struggling to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman stuck by her and supported her through the surgery and the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His wife said: 'Branden stuck by me through all of that, even at such a young age and facing life with potentially having your wife in a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He took great care of me all the way through. I am so grateful. He's such a good man.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now looking after Newman and helping to support him while he battles his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pair has also launched a fundraiser to help cover hospital and emergency bills triggered by battling the disease. It has already raised $140,000 out of its $35,000 goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:38:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>亚当斯县2人感染西尼罗河病毒- KUSA.com | 2 people in Adams County infected with West Nile Virus - KUSA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNWTJxaWY1YVlmMGt0amlXV1pkN3V2OXFUWm81QnVKdDE4bXcwb19RM3pHNFQ2MVVNRjlsQ1FCOEdGVkJnWmljSGhIU3F5dGJ0dHAtLVVYeU9SeFFyTHhVckVuX0t5aDlWTk9rX2RkX1ZaaXVacF9SY2M3YlZ6NG9ZbmdZa2tiN2ZwZ1Rwd0Q4RVVhQUx3TnJzc0FBRTVwcHZLVi0yT1dOY1VnZU5YaXc4MC0ydUZrRmFDLXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

People infected &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-7471039/Toddler-diagnosed-case-drug-resistant-typhoid-trip-Pakistan.html"&gt;with resistant typhoid&lt;/a&gt; carry it to new countries, while the global food trade spreads resistant bacteria to dense cities with poor sanitation accelerates the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers warned that the most commonly used antibiotics, including Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, and Azithromycin, may not save patients’ lives like they used to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 5,700 Americans become ill each year, and 620 are hospitalized. Deaths from typhoid fever in the US are very infrequent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jason Andrews, a specialist in infectious diseases at Stanford University and lead author of the report, said the breakneck pace at which S. Typhi is spreading ‘is a real cause for concern.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid fever sickens 11million people every year, causing fever, abdominal pain, and, if left untreated, intestinal bleeding and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-d4cb4440-632b-11f0-970a-09a9b27031ec"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;. It kills about 100,000 people annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Our study found resistant typhoid crossed borders 197 times since 1990 - mostly within South Asia, and spreading to Africa and beyond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one in five people who are not treated for typhoid will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the genes of a strain of bacteria mutate to resist antibiotics, doctors have far fewer treatment options when patients present with typhoid symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analyzed the genetics of over 7,600 samples of S. Typhi, including 3,489 samples from individuals with typhoid in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan from 2014 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked at 4,169 older samples from more than 70 countries, some dating back to 1905. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They pored over the bacteria’s genetic blueprint to identify genes that can change the bacterial protein that antibiotics usually attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes the bacteria to make enzymes that break down the drug, eject antibiotics before they work, or use alternative biochemical pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team warned that typhoid-causing bacteria are mutating so rapidly that modern medicine can’t keep up, stating that by the time scientists decide to use vaccines based on today's resistance data, it may already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;South Asia is a hotspot where resistance continues to develop and then spreads globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Approximately 5,700 Americans become ill each year, and 620 are hospitalized. Deaths from typhoid fever in the US are very infrequent (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since 1990, strains resistant to the antibiotic class quinolones have evolved independently at least 94 times, with 97 percent of these cases originating in South Asia, specifically in countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What began as localized resistance, affecting 85 percent of Bangladeshi typhoid cases by the early 2000s, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-5618227/First-known-epidemic-drug-resistant-typhoid-spreading-Pakistan.html"&gt;exploded across the region&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing a 95 percent prevalence in India, Pakistan, and Nepal within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pattern repeats with newer drugs. Azithromycin resistance has emerged seven times since 2003, with Bangladeshi strains steadily proliferating since 2013, while resistance to last-line antibiotics cephalosporins now looms as the next frontier in the escalating crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these strains most often occur within South Asia and spread from there to Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Southern Africa, they have also been reported in the US, UK and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Andrew said: ‘The fact resistant strains of S. Typhi have spread internationally so many times also underscores the need to view typhoid control, and antibiotic resistance more generally, as a global rather than local problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext"&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/a&gt; journal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid is rare in the US, and cases typically arise after a person has traveled internationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It primarily affects people in areas with poor sanitation, and children under five are more susceptible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, a Massachusetts daycare center temporarily closed after a child &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-5715271/Child-diagnosed-typhoid-fever-Massachusetts-daycare.html"&gt;was diagnosed with typhoid&lt;/a&gt;, likely contracted during recent international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid fever spreads through fecal-oral transmission, meaning people ingest the bacteria Salmonella Typhi from food, water, or surfaces that have come in contact with fecal matter, such as eating food handled by someone with typhoid who didn’t wash their hands after using the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study has some gaps that need to be considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers lacked sufficient genetic data from key regions, particularly parts of Africa and Oceania, where typhoid is prevalent. Without more samples from these areas, it is more difficult to track how and when resistant strains spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even in countries with better monitoring, most samples are collected from just a few locations, which may not accurately reflect what is happening elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since only a small fraction of typhoid cases get genetically tested, the true scale of antibiotic resistance and global spread is probably even worse than the numbers show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said THIS highlights the need ‘to expand genomic surveillance to provide a more comprehensive window into the emergence, expansion, and spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 18:08:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxNNENyVEU4NnJuR0htRlRJVzBqWlNadC1ZX2VQemFKYW1kTjNYQVJHQ2tWY2FZZ1d2cDBxdWMtcTE3ZGxiT2JrRVdmcmY4bDZXVTQybFJCUnEwa01uSXY1cHVFU0kwTE9iYzdSaFowWUlyZjhTbldiNzZOMHNjYWZEckQ3dVQ0TEozOGhzeFdvMUpFS2lTY3FLR2g1eFBrZGF3OHpCdmR6TGVTQVdfV2ZWbUlwcXFQLXhyWjZPTlBNbEdJaE8zLWfSAcsBQVVfeXFMTXdqX1VGbXlSd1pGRWVMcENXNmlGRkFwclBtYXQ2SzlNNVVpRXdYWjA2ZVBJZDhIcko4WVpGdzJBcWhyaXFQVEpJTDhyWVVzN1VNbUFGZ2U3V254N0xlVDlGV1BfZlpxcVZCel80X3NRdGt1NjA0SURVby15NUo0VGxkcDBwNE9EbFVvaWhILWJzRnVpVF9rcUs2UGI3UHlDQS1tdE5FMXVsRWRKSXFxWVkyVHQyREdQMURIN0Z3VEpUR1Z3ZnlmTkhUMzQ</guid></item><item><title>使用David Baker的新人工智能技术，无法治疗的“无序”蛋白质变得可以吸毒- STAT | Undruggable ‘disordered’ proteins become druggable with new AI techniques from David Baker - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxON2l2X01jNmVDb3pmNGVNN3JNTWtVQW43VS1rY0xtZ3hYaXV1Qkc2YW1vZzA2TWdRMHY3cG5kM2xLQ3h6clhwU0w0NGtTT1RkU25JUU5VTmJkN01jVC1mWjY0WXZ0clRGMC1ObmtPVTdMbWNIWTRKTEliems3N3h1a3N2QkkzbTM3RmhyeFV2WFBnTWtlWFo1LVpmbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, structural biologists shoved what looked like shoddy data in the back of their closets, embarrassed. While attempting to gather the structures of proteins, they would sometimes find that all or at least a portion of the protein would just not show up correctly in the data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joel Sussman, a former head of the Protein Data Bank, remembers when he found his first intrinsically disordered protein, though it wasn’t called that at the time. He showed it to a collaborator. “‘Oh, Joel, you’re not a very good biochemist. Obviously, it has a structure and you’re confused,’” he recalled her saying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most proteins fold into shapes with distinct elements: the ordered spiral of an alpha-helix, like a piece of cavatappi pasta; or beta sheets, like a slice of a lasagna — squiggly lines of pasta amino acids held parallel to each other with cheesy and saucy hydrogen bonds. A central tenet of structural biology is that a protein’s structure dictates its function. But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003169972411616X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;around the same time&lt;/a&gt; that the world was preparing for Y2K, structural biologists finally began admitting that — just as Sussman and other scientists had seen — not all proteins have a permanent shape. A surprisingly large amount of important proteins (in fact, over &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr400713r" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;half of all proteins in eukaryotes&lt;/a&gt;, it’s estimated) have strands of wiggly “spaghetti” in them. &lt;/p&gt;

While tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this disruption causes permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease and dementia, causing patients to lose their ability to speak, care for themselves or even respond to the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition and over 100,00 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading health experts recommend taking 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 - priced at 20 cents per capsule or $17.99 for 90 - every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no clear cause of the Alzheimer's disease, experts believe it can develop due to genetic mutations and lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional studies have also shown that Vitamin D &lt;span&gt;provides protection to the brain cells, regulates nerve growth as well as genes important for brain function.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, the body makes vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin or absorbs it from foods such as milk, egg yolks, beef liver, mushrooms and fatty fishes like salmon and mackerel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest that having a vitamin D level of 20 nanograms/ milliliter (mg/ml) in the blood or higher is adequate for good bone health and anything below 20ng/ml is considered a deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite the critical role it plays, nearly 40 percent of adults are Vitamin D deficient, meaning they are more likely to develop conditions such as osteoporosis (fragile bones), heart problems and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, it also aids the function of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which play vital roles in overall mood, cognition and behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, a deficiency can damage the cell and nerve growth process in the brain which can cause a decline in cognitive abilities, including executive functions like paying attention and processing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain cell and nerve damage can also contribute to problems in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation, which in turn can impair communication between brain regions as well as the brain and rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taking regular Vitamin D supplements can help protect brain cells,contribute to brain development and maintain cognitive function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D deficiency can manifest in symptoms similar to depression, such as low mood, fatigue and loss of interest in activities - all of which are major contributors to the development of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking regular vitamin D supplements can help maintain healthy levels of the vitamin in the body which can help protection brain cells, contribute to brain development and maintain cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D supplements can also help reduce oxidative stress in the brain, described as an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body that leads to cell damage and various neurological conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties that can help slow down cognitive decline in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from capsules, Vitamin D levels in the blood can also be increased by eating consuming foods such as fatty fish and milk while also spending more time in the sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But there’s also some DNA outside of the cell’s nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-093ea3" class="body-graf"&gt;Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it’s not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcbca7" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-genetic-babies-mitochondria-three-parent-6d826809d66a4474bc9dc455c475ad58"&gt;first babies&lt;/a&gt; had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother’s egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6868f3" class="body-graf"&gt;The latest research “marks an important milestone,” said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. “Expanding the range of reproductive options … will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8adb7" class="body-graf"&gt;Using this method means the embryo has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/baby-born-using-three-parent-technique-doctors-say-n655701" target="_blank"&gt;DNA from three people&lt;/a&gt; — from the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm and the donor’s mitochondria — and it required a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-parenting-relationships-69d7ed6e2c6b4072b0e3d036ecb939a3"&gt;2016 U.K. law change&lt;/a&gt; to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45021d" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts at Britain’s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases.

He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bad407" class="body-graf"&gt;Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, called it “highly significant,” adding that the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-78c490" class="body-graf"&gt;“The technique was first made lawful 10 years ago, so we have all been waiting for this report,” he told NBC News over email. “Fortunately, the children appear to be healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab05c4" class="body-graf"&gt;Follow-up of these children — potentially for many years — would be important to ensure they remain healthy, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c69147" class="body-graf"&gt;Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born by using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-942dcb" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor … you will have much more DNA from another person,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51b907" class="body-graf"&gt;In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country’s fertility regulator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6216f2" class="body-graf"&gt;Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it’s impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a02cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“Currently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,” Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. ”Whether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a75c76" class="body-graf"&gt;For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, “in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9fc6b6" class="body-graf"&gt;But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-230b1d" class="body-graf"&gt;Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcc33d" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the diagnosis “turned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.” Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter’s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-47af43" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s super exciting for families that don’t have much hope in their lives,” Curtis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-569a09" class="body-graf"&gt;The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, the UK’s fertility regulator, welcomed the findings, adding that the technique would legally only be available to those at very high risk of passing the disease onto their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e93a7a" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 17:22:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPR3pBY2FWTVd1eS1sRGEyYUdYUy1XcnBmOUJrZVZSWVB2X2hpQW5SeXlqRFFiTkZQcWpFN1FiNkYtSU9RWXprd1ZMZDFYWHdmSTloNEsyN1ZuVExCQThCMHB2WGtUdXk0RXJzaV9XUGpuR09iNVAyM3VvQ2ZHWGFMVmpyNllzbzhsdHhlaVAzaXZ6UUhnSmUtM1R6WDd3Q0ZMZTRMNG1fSUZPSlpESy1BVFdocWZMWHlw0gFWQVVfeXFMTTF0UkdRcnZEbllDOHFwZVdDRWlTd2JoOEt0UXlHVDVaY1JodU5KTXlLU1cyVldmQXo4SkpaZkhMMXpYVUNuaEZwRTZyVGRtbUY0UzFpa0E</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，这些是老年人最好的6种维生素和矿物质- CNET | These Are the 6 Best Vitamins and Minerals for Older Adults, According to Experts - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNbzdzcDR6cFFyVWpXTzEwbHB4X0F1S3hpU3RZejhqOGxSdUhYR281SDRjUURXSVJfZXdMODRra29QYllfVGlOWXNWSWNYc0lodUl3bXUwU2VwQ1NEaTlybnpiWEpHcU1Ma3pnZ2ZKMl9LNS11NlBmU0dHQXZaWmp2eHlENTRGMkUyaVN2Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Getting a good selection of vitamins and minerals in your diet is vital to staying fit and healthy, and that shouldn't be a shock to anyone at this point.

Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells.

Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a data-id="62a38b00-866c-4718-bb35-e93cd6b25a9e" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" target="_self"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a data-id="62a38b00-866c-4718-bb35-e93cd6b25a9e" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)."

Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-id="4bcc0d6a-5e1b-4506-a312-ccce96fb8e02" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" target="_self"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of &lt;a data-id="4bcc0d6a-5e1b-4506-a312-ccce96fb8e02" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/how-we-ensure-accurate-and-reliable-medical-information/" target="_self"&gt;CNET's Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;, adds that people taking medicine that blocks B12 absorption, like omeprazole or metformin, may also need a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="63b88bbd-7786-4e03-b50d-6188e59d0f33" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3.

"As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese.

Because if it was always a thing, then he wasn’t masturbating as a teenager, as somebody living with parents. So I would have a lot more kinds of questions for the husband.

Right? I’m not even sure you can get into a therapist that quickly in the U.S. these days.&lt;/p&gt;

Also, this is, at least temporarily, an issue that has an endpoint in sight. So it’s annoying for our writer to go a month or so without sex, but you can do it. It’s possible. It’s not food, you’re not going to starve. It’s sex, you can take care of yourself. You may not be able to avoid his mom during this period. So, that’s what it is. Given the abundance of issues that we see, not just in this column but in the world, I’m finding it a little bit difficult to sympathize. As much as I understand this is a serious issue, I also know you will live to see another day of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

But at the end of the day, it’s just inconvenient. An erection is not the be-all and end-all of partnered sexual interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

Plenty of other people, for one reason or another, are partnered with someone who has a penis that doesn’t reliably become erect. Sometimes there is an erect penis, and people still choose to have sex without engaging with the penis. So, they’ve got a lot of options; all they have to do is get a little bit creative. I am a bit sorry that you’re not going to get dicked down real good during this time. But you will survive. If the husband is of the mindset that because he’s not hard, they’re not going to have sex, then you have hands. You can get sex toys and use your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

Has he tried a PDE5 inhibitor? Has he used a cock ring? Sometimes you need that extra kind of assurance or lift to knock yourself out of a pattern. And then once you understand that you can do it through medical means, the psychological aspect can fall to the background because you’re just bumping yourself out of that loop of, &lt;em&gt;I see my mom, I can’t get an erection, this is my life&lt;/em&gt;. But then, if you can assist yourself medically, you can show yourself that you can do it. So, I wonder how much he has actually practiced getting over this.&lt;/p&gt;

Regarding this sentence: “I don’t think I can go without sex that long!”, think about that. What is sex doing for you in your life that maybe could be spread out over a more diverse toolbox?&lt;/p&gt;

Because if it is, you could try exercise or acts of charity. If you’re bored, you can read or watch a million things that are on TV. And if you’re that horny, again, just masturbate or have him masturbate with you. Figure out a different way for a little bit. It’s an opportunity to explore. This isn’t one of those situations where it’s the parents are staying with you, and if they hear you, it’s going to create a rift. It seems like they can still do whatever they’d like while the parents are living there. So create a new frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Scientists have revealed how certain immune cells may be quietly helping prostate cancer grow—and how blocking them could help the body fight back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-24-0791"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; identifies a group of cells called macrophages that, instead of protecting the body, appear to shield tumors from attack and promote tumor metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cells are typically the immune system’s housekeeping crew—engulfing dead cells and responding to infection—but in prostate cancer, some are reprogrammed by tumors to suppress the body’s immune responses and promote their own spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by Assistant Professor Shenglin Mei of the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute Cancer Research Center in Washington, DC, the study focused on tumor-associated macrophages, in advanced prostate cancer—particularly in the bone, where the disease is most deadly and difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among four &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/macrophages-communication-1374802-2/"&gt;macrophage&lt;/a&gt; subtypes identified, one stood out: a group marked by the proteins SPP1 and TREM2. These cells were found clustered inside tumor regions — not in surrounding tissue—and were linked to blood vessel growth, impaired immune activity, and the spread of cancer in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using spatial analysis—a technique that maps where cells are located within a tumor—researchers found that inflammatory, potentially tumor-fighting macrophages tended to remain outside tumor boundaries, but a specific subtype that produces the troublesome SPP1 and TREM2 proteins was found deep inside the tumors, in close contact with cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Macrophages often aid in fighting cancers,” Mei says. “However, certain subtypes foster an immune-suppressive environment, hindering the body’s natural defenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In follow-up experiments, Mei and his colleagues tested whether blocking these cells could improve treatment. In mice with prostate tumors, they used an antibody to block the SPP1 protein—and found that tumors were more vulnerable to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/cancer-immunotherapy-colitis-3069692/"&gt;immune checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; have worked in many other cancers, they’ve failed in prostate cancer. But in this study, combining anti-SPP1 treatment with immunotherapy significantly boosted the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Targeting SPP1/TREM2 tumor associated macrophages reversed immunosuppression, allowing more T cells—the immune system’s primary defenders—to infiltrate the tumor, resulting in slowed cancer progression,” Mei says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the United States and globally, with an estimated 1.47 million new cases worldwide in 2022, according to the World Cancer Research Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long suspected that the tumor microenvironment—the mix of immune cells, blood vessels, and signaling molecules around a tumor—plays a role in helping cancer escape detection. But this new study reveals, in greater detail, which cells are involved and how they’re working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this discovery, Mei’s lab combined advanced techniques—including single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and NanoString digital spatial profiling—to map immune cell activity and location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also analyzed large-scale, publicly available datasets from hundreds of prostate cancer patients, ensuring their findings held up across human samples, mouse models, and disease stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is about more than just one cell type,” says Mei, who also has an appointment with the biomedical sciences and pathobiology department in the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s about using spatial and single-cell analysis together to uncover vulnerabilities that we couldn’t see before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work builds directly on Mei’s earlier studies—a 2021 &lt;em&gt;Cancer Cell&lt;/em&gt; paper that revealed an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in bone metastases, and a 2023 &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; study that mapped immune cell patterns in primary tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study expands on that foundation, integrating old and new datasets to reveal a previously hidden player in prostate cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional researchers from Virginia Tech, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of Chicago, and Sweden’s Karolinska Institute contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for the project came from the Prostate Cancer Foundation, which awarded Mei a Young Investigator Award, and by the National Institutes of Health. Mei is among a cohort of new cancer research faculty at the research institute whose recruitment was supported by the Red Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

However, small mutations in mitochondrial DNA can affect tissues with high-energy demands such as the heart, muscle and brain, causing devastating disease and, in some cases, death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother, and although males can be affected, they do not transmit the disease, researchers said. About 1 in 5,000 babies are born worldwide each year with mutations that can cause the disease, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, scientists have detailed how an IVF technique called pronuclear transfer has been used to combine the DNA of three people to reduce the risk of mitochondrial disease being passed down the generations, in accompanying studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The technique uses 99.9 percent of the DNA from a man and woman, with another 0.1 percent from a second woman’s donor egg. It works by transplanting the nuclear genome of an egg from the mother with the condition - which contains genes essential for individual characteristics like hair color and height - to an egg donated by an unaffected woman that has had its nuclear genome removed, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The resulting embryo inherits nuclear DNA from its two parents, but the mitochondrial DNA comes from the donated egg, researchers said. The treatment was offered to certain women at very high risk of passing on serious mitochondrial disease, in accordance with U.K. regulations that assess each application for the procedure on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The eight infants &lt;strong&gt;- &lt;/strong&gt;who range in age from newborn to over 2 years old&lt;strong&gt; - &lt;/strong&gt;were assessed to be healthy, meeting developmental milestones and reported levels of mitochondrial disease-causing mutations that were undetectable or at levels unlikely to cause disease, the Newcastle University statement said. Three of the babies had levels of disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations of up to 20 percent, which is still below the 80 percent threshold for clinical disease, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doug Turnbull, a neurologist at Newcastle University who co-wrote the study, said it was the first to document a “cohort” of children who had received the treatment. He said it is the result of an extremely cautious approach by scientists and regulators that has been more than two decades in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“People have used very similar techniques, but nobody’s quite used this particular technique,” he told The Washington Post in a phone interview Thursday. “It’s just absolutely critical when you’re doing a new technique to be cautious and to make sure … it’s as safe and efficient as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The procedure has also raised concern from some, including religious groups, about its ethics and the fear that it could open the door to further genetic modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Peter Thompson, chief executive of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, which regulates the process in Britain, said that only people with a “very high risk” of passing on a serious mitochondrial disease are eligible for the treatment and that every application is assessed individually. As of July 1, 35 patients have been granted approval by U.K. authorities to proceed with the treatment since it was first licensed in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These robust but flexible regulatory processes allow the technique to be used safely for the purposes that Parliament agreed in 2015,” Thompson said in a statement in response to Wednesday’s news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have cautiously welcomed the findings, while stressing the importance of long-term monitoring and raising the prospect of whether the procedure offers advantages over embryo screening for genetic disease. Others have raised the issue of cost in the long-term project that is supported by Britain’s National Health Service and medical charity the Wellcome Trust, among other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mary Herbert, who is professor of reproductive biology at Newcastle University and lead author of the research paper, said “the findings give grounds for optimism” but further research is needed to “bridge the gap” between reducing risk of mitochondrial disease and preventing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turnbull said the team is also looking to improve medical techniques and follow up with the children involved for as long as possible to track their health outcomes.

Since doctors don’t routinely screen for pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers in the U.S., the authors also call for new ways to screen more people for these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b076ae" class="body-graf"&gt;“This really points to the importance of trying to improve screening and early detection,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, the review’s co-author and director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b6487" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the review, colorectal cancer is by far the most common early-onset gastrointestinal cancer, with nearly 185,000 cases reported worldwide in 2022 and nearly 21,000 cases reported that same year in the U.S. Diagnoses in the U.S. have risen 2% annually in people younger than 50 since 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb3245" class="body-graf"&gt;“It never used to happen in this age group, and now a very significant rise in 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds are getting colon cancer,” said Dr. John Marshall, chief medical consultant at the nonprofit &lt;a href="http://colorectalcancer.org" target="_blank"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the research. In one of the most high-profile examples, actor Chadwick Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2016 and died of the disease four years later at age 43.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f1ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Early-onset cases of pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers are also rising, according to the new study. Previous &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209?searchresult=1" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown a disproportionate share of those gastrointestinal cancer diagnoses were among Black and Hispanic people. Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest forms of cancer, with just &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;13% of patients&lt;/a&gt; surviving five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6677ef" class="body-graf"&gt;Because colorectal cancer is the most common, doctors said they have a better grasp of what might be contributing to these early-onset cases compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c691c5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we can understand what’s going on in colorectal [cancer], I think it would really provide a lot of guidance to help us understand the other GI tract cancers,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb5c48" class="body-graf"&gt;Kopetz said there are likely multiple factors driving the increase in early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7083ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“The leading theory is that there is no single leading theory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6405bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s new review in JAMA suggests that most gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50 are associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet, cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption. One &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/12/2330" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; included in the review found that women who consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages during adolescence had a higher risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46cefa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really what people were doing or exposed to when they were infants, children, adolescents that is probably contributing to their risk of developing cancer as a young adult,” Ng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb79f" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been vocal about the association between &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-announces-plans-remove-artificial-dyes-nations-food-supply-rcna202184" target="_blank"&gt;sugary beverages and health issues&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said Coca-Cola will start being made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup in the U.S., but the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/coca-cola-dodges-trump-says-soda-will-switch-back-cane-sugar-rcna219225" target="_blank"&gt;did not commit to the change&lt;/a&gt; when asked about it by NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e93909" class="body-graf"&gt;Marshall said he suspects the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer could have something to do with changes in people’s gut microbiomes — the bacteria that live in our gastrointestinal tracts. Diet, antibiotic use, microplastics and exposure to environmental chemicals likely all influence a person’s gut bacteria, but scientists still don’t have a clear understanding of what a healthy microbiome looks like nor how it affects our health. That is a booming area of research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6ba4c" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s review also found that 15% to 30% of people with early-onset gastrointestinal cancer carry hereditary genetic mutations that may have predisposed them to getting cancer at a young age.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Because of that, she said, “we do recommend that all young patients diagnosed under the age of 50 undergo testing for hereditary conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70c61" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall survival rates for gastrointestinal cancers have gotten better over time, due to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/stomach-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-symptoms-survival-rcna204536" target="_blank"&gt;improvements in treatment and screening&lt;/a&gt;. But Ng’s review found that younger patients often have worse outcomes, despite typically receiving more treatments, including more surgery, radiation and aggressive combinations of chemotherapy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b2210" class="body-graf"&gt;One reason could be that primary care doctors may overlook symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, heartburn or reflux in younger patients, thereby delaying their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4cc69f" class="body-graf"&gt;“My personal feeling is that it’s because we’re finding them at a more advanced stage, because people don’t really think of colon or other GI cancers when they see a young person with these nonspecific complaints,” said Dr. Howard Hochster, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-732ba8" class="body-graf"&gt;But Ng said that even after controlling for the stage at which patients are diagnosed, young people still seem to have worse survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4322c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This makes us wonder as researchers whether that means that the cancers that develop in younger people may be biologically different and more aggressive, or maybe less responsive to treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 15:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQNC13cnJFQlMxb21GUjQxdGtCcFFqLXRsTkprMUhYVkhLWWxSQmZmbURycFNrdlBHZXpkT2ZrbFUwZnJKYUtwME91emJiaWZmc1ctQUs3Rk9Wa2FQOUNXcGhGc1h3NTRBZFkwczlpUEN6ZGZvVEo0SDRmeVdlZGwyOTJUbGJzRzJHLTVXRzRYdXJPdWVEMTFjYU84d01acFZNVWtmd2dCTHAyTmNYVU5ITF9n0gFWQVVfeXFMTm1qc29YLUpsczRRdTJNRGtPZWV6dkpNTmVpVkRNY2JFZkdZR21FZDVnMUtVdDZyTkdWVVpmOWJvaVRzSkRib3lvS3ZqNGVCaXQ4TTNjX1E</guid></item><item><title>爱荷华州家庭的经历凸显了麻疹暴露的鲜为人知的后果- AOL.com | Iowa family's experience highlights the lesser-known consequences of a measles exposure - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBIMjZZamY3bWpWZ2ItS29lUy15dkJLZHNsNVZrR0JXcnFaZW43YlZFaERfbGMzc243WllvM2ZnTjd0Q1AxNmNWVFFzUE9yV0poWld4RkJLdl9uaGg0OTlScUtZa0hYejVUTm1BMXJINXYtekFzTWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martha Martin has to use up all of her remaining vacation days for the year to stay home with her infant son, and it still won’t be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine-month-old Hal was recently &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-daycare-outbreak-confirmed-cases-rcna199631" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exposed to measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;exposed to measles&lt;/a&gt; at day care and can’t go back for almost a full month. He’s not had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which isn’t recommended until age 1. When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just makes me so mad that this is happening,” said Martin, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “It’s scary because my son is not protected, and I’m having to worry about child care and my job and my husband’s job.” In these situations, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; quarantine for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because he’s too young for the measles vaccine, Hal needed emergency shots of immunoglobulin, or IG, an antibody that helps the immune system fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Martin said, “it’s just a waiting game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family’s worry and frustration are playing out in households nationwide as the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:number of measles cases has surpassed a level;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;number of measles cases has surpassed a level&lt;/a&gt; not seen since the highly contagious virus was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1,309 cases of measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;1,309 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in 39 states. The vast majority of patients are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of those cases has had the opportunity to expose hundreds or even thousands of other people, especially kids, either too young to be vaccinated, like Hal, or children with weak immune systems, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock, Texas, cared for many families during the recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles outbreak in West Texas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;measles outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of our families, hard-working families, typically don't have a month's savings of salary to stay home, yet they have to," Montanez said. "Oftentimes it's not just one job, but two, maybe three."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cedar Rapids isn’t experiencing an outbreak of measles. Just &lt;a href="https://www.linncountyiowa.gov/1777/Measles#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven cases have been confirmed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seven cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; across Iowa in 2025, according to the latest data in the state. They are the first reported measles cases in Iowa since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Martin family’s situation illustrates the ripple effects of a single exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s happening in our town is a perfect example of why vaccination is important,” said Dr. Dustin Arnold, chief medical officer at UnityPoint Health-Cedar Rapids. “It just takes one” measles case, he said, to set off waves of impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Arnold ran a command center giving out immunoglobulin, or IG shots for eight babies who were exposed to measles at the same day care as Hal. Three others were sent to a nearby medical facility for the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IG injections can be given up to six days after exposure to measles. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8675579/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IG treatments aren’t a permanent fix, said Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Children “develop much higher levels of immunity from vaccination than from immunoglobulin,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cedar Rapids IG clinics, led by Arnold, were pulled together at the very last minute. The babies who got the injections had been exposed six days earlier, on Monday, July 7. Families were notified late Friday, July 11, and the treatments started the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are infants out there who have no protection, and we don’t want them to get sick,” Arnold said. “Measles can be mild, but it can also be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of measles patients have fared well despite their illness. Still, 13%, or 164 patients, needed to be hospitalized because of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three people — including two young girls in Texas — have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:died of measles this year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;died of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;.

Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest forms of cancer, with just &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;13% of patients&lt;/a&gt; surviving five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6677ef" class="body-graf"&gt;Because colorectal cancer is the most common, doctors said they have a better grasp of what might be contributing to these early-onset cases compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c691c5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we can understand what’s going on in colorectal [cancer], I think it would really provide a lot of guidance to help us understand the other GI tract cancers,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb5c48" class="body-graf"&gt;Kopetz said there are likely multiple factors driving the increase in early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7083ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“The leading theory is that there is no single leading theory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6405bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s new review in JAMA suggests that most gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50 are associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet, cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption. One &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/12/2330" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; included in the review found that women who consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages during adolescence had a higher risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46cefa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really what people were doing or exposed to when they were infants, children, adolescents that is probably contributing to their risk of developing cancer as a young adult,” Ng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb79f" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been vocal about the association between &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-announces-plans-remove-artificial-dyes-nations-food-supply-rcna202184" target="_blank"&gt;sugary beverages and health issues&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said Coca-Cola will start being made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup in the U.S., but the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/coca-cola-dodges-trump-says-soda-will-switch-back-cane-sugar-rcna219225" target="_blank"&gt;did not commit to the change&lt;/a&gt; when asked about it by NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e93909" class="body-graf"&gt;Marshall said he suspects the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer could have something to do with changes in people’s gut microbiomes — the bacteria that live in our gastrointestinal tracts. Diet, antibiotic use, microplastics and exposure to environmental chemicals likely all influence a person’s gut bacteria, but scientists still don’t have a clear understanding of what a healthy microbiome looks like nor how it affects our health. That is a booming area of research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6ba4c" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s review also found that 15% to 30% of people with early-onset gastrointestinal cancer carry hereditary genetic mutations that may have predisposed them to getting cancer at a young age.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Because of that, she said, “we do recommend that all young patients diagnosed under the age of 50 undergo testing for hereditary conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70c61" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall survival rates for gastrointestinal cancers have gotten better over time, due to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/stomach-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-symptoms-survival-rcna204536" target="_blank"&gt;improvements in treatment and screening&lt;/a&gt;. But Ng’s review found that younger patients often have worse outcomes, despite typically receiving more treatments, including more surgery, radiation and aggressive combinations of chemotherapy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b2210" class="body-graf"&gt;One reason could be that primary care doctors may overlook symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, heartburn or reflux in younger patients, thereby delaying their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4cc69f" class="body-graf"&gt;“My personal feeling is that it’s because we’re finding them at a more advanced stage, because people don’t really think of colon or other GI cancers when they see a young person with these nonspecific complaints,” said Dr. Howard Hochster, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-732ba8" class="body-graf"&gt;But Ng said that even after controlling for the stage at which patients are diagnosed, young people still seem to have worse survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4322c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This makes us wonder as researchers whether that means that the cancers that develop in younger people may be biologically different and more aggressive, or maybe less responsive to treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQLTJZa3cwTmZ4TmI5eUJLODJNTTFpbFN6TVNsQXFTSFF2aXQ4UWhsOVdmVjhTd3l4NHV5NGl4LUx5OVQ1ZVA2cnA5OF9aOXFvRDYxdjVwUXhOZzlncUVzY1ljNllRbDhzYXRwNzA0WGVJVEJYZ1U4a2ZyeGRVY0xEMHVLU0FXOW11bnVnWUxlZGpxVkZpTG5aajBhaTlhTURXd1ZfWHZWYWdUZHl00gFWQVVfeXFMTm1qc29YLUpsczRRdTJNRGtPZWV6dkpNTmVpVkRNY2JFZkdZR21FZDVnMUtVdDZyTkdWVVpmOWJvaVRzSkRib3lvS3ZqNGVCaXQ4TTNjX1E</guid></item><item><title>大脑如何在感知和记忆之间进行选择-神经科学新闻 | How the Brain Selects Between Perception and Memory - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOenUxZGZUTnp1ZkRId3VZOTRUenBNLXhrcXA2ZjI5UDQ4RHA2S1YwWnlmVlF2d0syVVR2SF81dUJtZzBfT0xLdzl6QnJmTlhjWG1GUTFsRWxYUnBXVmpxOU41YkpDeEtOckhxUXNwZHhnVERSX1FKZ0Y3RTQtU3NKeWM5WHVISmZk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;The brain constantly toggles between focusing on external sensory information and internal mental representations like memories, plans, and thoughts. This seamless switching is crucial for adaptive behavior, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research highlights both shared and distinct neural networks for external and internal attention, revealing costs and trade-offs when shifting between them. Understanding these processes could illuminate how attention operates in natural settings and how disruptions may contribute to cognitive or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Both external and internal attention recruit overlapping frontoparietal networks, but internal attention also engages medial and ventrolateral prefrontal regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Behavioral studies show measurable performance costs when shifting attention between external and internal domains compared to within a single domain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Questions:&lt;/strong&gt; It remains unclear whether a superordinate control system coordinates these shifts or if they emerge from competitive dynamics within existing attention systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every day, your brain seamlessly balances between two worlds: the sights, sounds, and sensations streaming in from your surroundings, and the thoughts, memories, and plans you hold inside your mind. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability—to switch between focusing on what’s “out there” and what’s “in here”—is fundamental to how we adapt and function. Yet surprisingly, science has only recently begun to explore how the brain orchestrates this intricate dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research sheds light on the neural mechanisms behind these shifts in attention, uncovering both striking similarities and critical differences between how the brain handles external and internal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing how we direct focus toward the sensory environment versus mental representations, scientists hope to explain not only everyday behaviors—like remembering your grocery list while watching traffic—but also shed light on disorders where these systems may go awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Attention Is More Than Meets the Eye&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For over a century, attention research focused primarily on the external world: how the brain selects and prioritizes sensory signals like sights and sounds. We now understand much about how frontal and parietal networks work together to amplify important signals, suppress distractions, and guide actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even early theorists recognized that attention doesn’t stop at the senses—it also operates inside the mind. Internal attention allows you to focus on a memory, an idea, or a plan, sifting through mental contents to guide behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of internal attention gained momentum when scientists began to explore how cues can boost working memory performance by “retrofocusing” on specific stored items. These discoveries showed that internal attention can improve accuracy and even enhance the quality of memories being recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Switching Between Two Domains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In everyday life, however, external and internal attention rarely operate in isolation. Whether driving, working, or chatting with a friend, we constantly shift back and forth—watching what’s happening, recalling what to do next, imagining possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises a fascinating question: how does the brain switch between these two domains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are finding that while external and internal attention share many of the same brain networks—particularly the dorsal frontoparietal system—they also engage unique regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal attention seems to recruit medial and ventrolateral prefrontal areas, possibly because selecting among mental representations requires different computations than scanning the sensory world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, switching between domains appears to incur a small but measurable cost: reaction times slow, and errors increase compared to switching between two tasks within the same domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this cost seems to be asymmetrical—switching from external to internal focus tends to take longer than the reverse, perhaps because the external world so readily captures our attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rhythms and Competition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists suggest these shifts are not just deliberate but may also follow intrinsic rhythms. Attention appears to oscillate between external and internal focus on timescales from milliseconds to hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rhythmic cycling could help the brain balance learning from the environment with consolidating internal models—ensuring neither domain dominates at the expense of the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence also suggests that external and internal contents interact competitively within sensory areas. When working memory contents and incoming sensory signals share the same features, they can interfere with each other—though higher-order areas like the parietal cortex may help shield internal representations from disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Search for a “Switchboard”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What coordinates these shifts? Some hypotheses propose a superordinate control mechanism—a kind of neural “switchboard”—that determines when to prioritize external or internal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates for this role include the hippocampus, which is known to alternate between encoding new sensory information and retrieving stored memories, and the anterior mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in high-level control over competing cognitive demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other theories suggest no dedicated switchboard is necessary; instead, shifts between domains may emerge from competitive dynamics within shared networks, where whichever domain has more salient or urgent information wins out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies provide intriguing clues. Tasks that require switching between perceptual and memory-based decisions activate additional prefrontal and parietal regions compared to within-domain shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet measures of spatial attention—like subtle eye movements and alpha-band brain oscillations—shift at the same speed whether the target is external or internal, suggesting the bottleneck may lie later in processing, perhaps at the level of decision-making or motor planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the brain shifts between external and internal attention is not just an academic exercise. These mechanisms are central to flexible, adaptive behavior—allowing us to plan, reflect, and act effectively in a dynamic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruptions to these systems could underlie symptoms of conditions like ADHD, schizophrenia, and depression, where individuals may become stuck in internal rumination or overly reactive to external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing the neural underpinnings of these shifts, researchers aim to develop interventions that help restore balance—whether through cognitive training, neuromodulation, or targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Open Questions and Future Directions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the field moves forward, many exciting questions remain. Can the brain operate external and internal attention in parallel, or do they always compete? Which neural circuits resolve conflicts between the two? How do different types of internal contents—like imagination, long-term memories, or future plans—interact with sensory inputs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental designs that mimic real-life scenarios, like navigating virtual environments or multitasking under time pressure, will help capture the natural ebb and flow between external and internal focus. Animal models, advanced imaging techniques, and computational models will also be key to untangling the complex dynamics of this interplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward a Unified Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emerging view is that external and internal attention are not isolated systems but deeply intertwined aspects of a larger cognitive architecture. By understanding how the brain selects, prioritizes, and integrates information from both domains, we move closer to explaining how thoughts and perceptions come together to guide behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, this line of research reminds us that much of what we experience as “being present” in the world depends on the seamless and often invisible work of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you catch yourself recalling a memory while glancing at a passing car—or planning your next move in a conversation while listening to someone speak—you’re witnessing your brain’s remarkable ability to bridge two worlds at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award (ACN) 104571/Z/14/Z and by BrainWorks at the Center for Neurocognition and Behavior in the Wu Tsai Institute, Yale University (RRID: SCR_024556).

For decades, scientists have investigated mechanisms to anticipate, select, prioritize, and prepare sensory signals according to goals, memories, and salient events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, researchers have considered how these attention functions operate within internal representations. However, neither external nor internal attention in isolation captures everyday behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain frequently and seamlessly shifts between contents from the sensory stream and those held in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this perspective, we ask how the brain shifts between external and internal attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe similarities and differences between selective external and internal attention, present competing hypotheses regarding the operating principles of between-domain shifts, and highlight putative brain areas and mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss the scarce experimental forays comparing attention shifts between vs. within domains and contemplate how these constrain theoretical and computational models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude by suggesting open questions to guide investigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 14:42:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOenUxZGZUTnp1ZkRId3VZOTRUenBNLXhrcXA2ZjI5UDQ4RHA2S1YwWnlmVlF2d0syVVR2SF81dUJtZzBfT0xLdzl6QnJmTlhjWG1GUTFsRWxYUnBXVmpxOU41YkpDeEtOckhxUXNwZHhnVERSX1FKZ0Y3RTQtU3NKeWM5WHVISmZk</guid></item><item><title>持续的冷漠预测阿尔茨海默病的功能下降速度更快- PsyPost | Persistent apathy predicts faster functional decline in Alzheimer’s disease - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQVXJFeF9oZWs3d29NRWRqVkE0elltN3FrQnlQeWc2dkhIdWtncHFBVnNGT3VXVTJyX3RaNmpINllKS0hxM0VLcTlfdzUwSUNxU3c3NGZZMUZ6Qy1iM2dMTUtOS2dwWXBUc1RwY0RwUjRsY3AyU19PLUxIa2dTNVFrMlVqeFZBRlloc1pZV0dZTTRTUzVIRDFXWFFNZmw4cEdT?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study sheds light on how behavioral symptoms are related to daily functioning in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers found that individuals with persistent apathy—characterized by diminished motivation and reduced emotional engagement—tend to experience a faster loss of independence over time. While people with Alzheimer’s disease can show different clusters of behavioral symptoms, apathy stood out as a particularly strong predictor of functional decline. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.20250015" target="_blank"&gt;The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. As the disease advances, people often lose the ability to perform everyday tasks, such as managing finances or preparing meals. While memory loss is the most widely recognized symptom, many people with Alzheimer’s also experience changes in mood and behavior. These changes, known as neuropsychiatric symptoms, can include apathy, depression, agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. These symptoms can be distressing for both patients and caregivers and have been linked to worse outcomes, such as faster cognitive decline and earlier nursing home placement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how behavioral symptoms influence the course of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers from multiple institutions analyzed data from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, which compiles information from Alzheimer’s research centers across the United States. They wanted to know whether clusters of behavioral symptoms—such as people who mainly show depression and apathy, or those who exhibit multiple symptoms—were linked to differences in how quickly someone’s ability to function declines over time. They also asked whether specific symptoms might be more predictive of decline than broader symptom patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been studying neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia for some time and have always wondered if specific symptoms or specific individuals who manifest clusters of symptoms may be suitable targets for interventions for preventing and delaying functional decline,” said study author Carolyn W. Zhu, a professor and data core lead at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers included nearly 9,800 participants who had been diagnosed with either mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease at the start of the study. All participants were over the age of 50 and had at least one follow-up visit over the course of up to five years. People with very mild or very severe dementia at the start were excluded. The average age of the sample was about 74 years old, and most participants were white and highly educated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track everyday functioning, researchers used a standard tool called the Functional Assessment Questionnaire. This questionnaire asks whether a person has difficulty with common activities, such as handling money, remembering appointments, or cooking. The responses are provided by someone who knows the participant well, such as a spouse or adult child. Higher scores on this scale indicate more difficulty with daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral symptoms were assessed by expert clinicians at each visit. These clinicians reported whether the participant was currently showing symptoms such as apathy, depression, hallucinations, or agitation. The researchers looked at whether these symptoms were present at baseline, and whether they appeared intermittently or persistently over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a statistical method called latent class analysis, the team identified four main clusters of participants based on their symptom profiles at the start of the study. The largest group, which made up nearly half the sample, had few or no behavioral symptoms. A second group, comprising about 35% of participants, had high rates of apathy and depression. A third group, about 13%, showed multiple symptoms including agitation and irritability, but not hallucinations. The smallest group—just under 3%—showed high levels of all symptoms, including psychosis, and was labeled the “complex” group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptom clusters were associated with differences in how well people were functioning at the beginning of the study. People in the asymptomatic group had better functional abilities than those in the other groups. However, over time, the rate of decline in functioning did not differ significantly between the groups. In other words, being in a certain symptom cluster did not predict how fast someone would lose the ability to carry out everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look more closely at individual symptoms, the researchers then examined whether the presence and persistence of each symptom predicted functional decline, even after accounting for which cluster the person belonged to. Apathy stood out as a key factor. People who were rated as persistently apathetic over time experienced a much faster rate of functional decline than those who never had apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even those who showed apathy intermittently declined more quickly than those who never had the symptom. In contrast, other symptoms such as depression, disinhibition, and irritability were not linked to faster decline once apathy and other factors were taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that delusions and agitation were linked to faster decline, but the effect was smaller than that seen for apathy. Hallucinations were associated with worse function at baseline, but not with a faster rate of decline over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand whether these findings applied to people in earlier versus later stages of the disease, the researchers conducted a separate analysis of people with mild cognitive impairment and those with full dementia. The results were consistent: apathy predicted faster decline in both groups, regardless of other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results showed that after taking into consideration other individual symptoms and different symptom clusters, apathy continued to be strongly associated with accelerated functional decline in dementia patients,” Zhu told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support earlier research showing that apathy is a common and persistent symptom in Alzheimer’s disease and may play a central role in the progression of the illness. Apathy affects more than motivation—it can reduce a person’s interest in social engagement, make them less likely to initiate activities, and impair their ability to follow through on tasks. This diminished drive can make it harder to maintain independence in everyday life, even in the absence of severe memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies suggest that apathy is linked to dysfunction in specific brain regions involved in motivation and reward processing, such as the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Some researchers have proposed that apathy may reflect damage to circuits that are distinct from those that underlie memory loss, which may help explain why it can be an early and independent predictor of functional decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study suggest that clinicians should pay particular attention to signs of apathy in people with Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment. While other symptoms like agitation or hallucinations often draw more attention because they are disruptive or alarming, apathy may have a more consistent impact on a person’s ability to function independently over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to the study. The participants were drawn from specialized research centers and were generally more educated and healthier than the general population. The assessments of symptoms were based on clinician judgment, which, while informed, may vary between clinicians. In addition, the study’s observational design means that it can identify associations but not prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the large sample size, long follow-up period, and detailed symptom tracking provide strong support for the conclusion that apathy plays a significant role in functional decline. This finding has practical implications. Apathy is relatively easy to observe and measure in clinical settings. Detecting it early may help identify people at higher risk of losing independence and offer a window of opportunity for intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is perhaps unsurprising that apathy, which is characterized by reduced motivation and independent goal-directed activity, should be so strongly associated with functional decline over time,” Zhu said. “However, its impact on function, which appears to be more significant than other more dramatic neuropsychiatric symptoms that often dominate clinicians’ time and attention, is likely under-appreciated in many clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that enhancing medical education for primary care providers who serve most patients with dementia, to improve awareness of neuropsychiatric symptoms in those with mild cognitive impairment and dementia may be a worthwhile strategy to providing patient centered care with better prediction of prognosis and targeted approaches for treatment and management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.20250015" target="_blank"&gt;Understanding the Role of Neuropsychiatric Symptom in Functional Decline in Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Carolyn W.

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing walking speed by 14 steps per minute boosted the odds of meaningful functional improvement in older adults with frailty.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Participants who walked “as fast as they safely could” were nearly twice as likely to improve on a standard 6-minute walk test compared to those walking at a casual pace.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;These gains were linked to individual speed increases, not just being in the “intensive” exercise group.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The findings suggest that tracking walking cadence with simple devices can guide personalized exercise plans in senior care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHICAGO —&lt;/strong&gt; Picking up the pace during a walk might sound like obvious health advice, but for millions of older Americans already showing signs of physical decline, those extra steps per minute could be the difference between maintaining independence and losing it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research tracking 102 &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;seniors&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago-area retirement communities reveals that increasing walking speed by just 14 steps per minute during exercise dramatically improves physical function in people &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/frailty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;who are frail &lt;/a&gt;or becoming frail. The four-month study found that 65% of seniors who walked “as fast as they safely could” saw meaningful improvements in their ability to walk longer distances, compared to only 39% of those who stuck to a comfortable, leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, this means someone who normally walks at 80 steps per minute and bumps it up to 94 steps per minute could see real improvements in their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;daily physical capacity&lt;/a&gt; — the kind that affects whether they can handle grocery shopping, climb stairs, or maintain their independence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-growing-problem-of-frailty"&gt;The Growing Problem of Frailty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frailty affects roughly 15% of Americans over 65 and goes far beyond &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;normal aging&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a medical condition marked by unintentional weight loss, constant exhaustion, muscle weakness, slow movement, and low activity levels. Unlike typical age-related changes, frailty creates a dangerous downward spiral where people become less active, which makes them weaker, which makes them even less active.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This cycle dramatically increases the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/falling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of falls&lt;/a&gt;, disability, hospitalization, and death. Breaking it has become urgent as America’s population ages rapidly, with researchers scrambling to find interventions that actually work for people who are already physically vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking programs have shown promise because they address multiple aspects of frailty at once. But figuring out &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the right exercise&lt;/a&gt; “prescription,” that is, how often, how long, and how hard people should walk, has been tricky. That’s especially the case for older adults with heart conditions or those taking medications that affect their response to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Faster walkers saw significant improvements in a 6-minute walking test that is often used for measuring physical function. (Inside Creative House/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-counting-steps-works-better-than-heart-rate"&gt;Why Counting Steps Works Better Than Heart Rate&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional ways of measuring exercise intensity often fail older adults. Heart rate monitors become unreliable when people take common medications like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/beta-blockers-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta blockers&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent heart rates from rising normally during exercise. Asking people to rate how hard they’re working on a scale of 1 to 10 also proves unreliable; many seniors struggle to accurately judge their exertion levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/steps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Counting steps&lt;/a&gt; per minute offers something much simpler and more objective. Anyone can track this using a smartphone or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/fitness-trackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;basic fitness watch&lt;/a&gt;, and previous research shows that hitting 100 steps per minute typically qualifies as moderate-intensity exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chicago study, led by Dr. Daniel Rubin, an associate professor at the University of Chicago, equipped participants with highly accurate accelerometers worn on the thigh throughout each exercise session. These devices recorded every step, allowing researchers to calculate precise &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; speeds for each person across the entire four-month program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-experiment-fast-walkers-vs-comfortable-pacers"&gt;The Experiment: Fast Walkers vs. Comfortable Pacers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 102 participants, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;averaging nearly 79 years old&lt;/a&gt;, represented diverse racial and economic backgrounds from 14 retirement communities. The majority (80%) were women, and all showed signs of being frail or prefrail based on standard medical assessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both groups followed identical schedules: three sessions per week, each lasting 45 minutes with 15 minutes of warm-up and cool-down plus 30 minutes of actual walking. The only difference was in the instructions given to each group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “casual speed walking” group was told to maintain a “relaxed and comfortable pace.” The “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/walking-speed-dementia-risk-older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-intensity walking&lt;/a&gt;” group was encouraged to walk “as fast as they safely could.” All sessions were supervised by trained staff who provided standardized encouragement and safety monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the final phase of the program, the results were stark. The high-intensity group averaged 100 steps per minute compared to 77 steps per minute for the casual walkers. More importantly, the faster walkers were far more likely to see meaningful improvements in a standard fitness test called the 6-minute walk test.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 6-minute walk test measures how far someone can walk in six minutes, which is a strong predictor of overall physical function and independence. For frail older adults, improving by 30 meters or more is considered clinically meaningful, representing real-world differences in the ability to complete daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers analyzed the data, they found that participants who increased their walking speed by 14 steps per minute from their comfortable baseline had significantly better odds of hitting this improvement threshold. Importantly, when they accounted for individual speed increases, the advantage of being in the “high-intensity” group disappeared entirely, meaning &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/walking-faster-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the speed boost itself&lt;/a&gt;, not just being told to walk faster, drove the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper did not report any serious injuries, and participants were allowed to rest as needed during sessions. Those breaks didn’t count toward their 30-minute walking target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, offers immediate practical applications for assisted living facilities, community centers, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt; working with older adults. Rather than generic “gentle exercise” programs, facilities could set individualized speed targets based on each person’s comfortable walking pace and use basic activity monitors to track progress toward that 14-step improvement goal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the millions of older Americans facing declining physical function, this research provides both hope and a concrete action plan. Maintaining independence may come down to something as measurable and achievable as adding 14 extra steps per minute &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;to regular walks&lt;/a&gt; — a remarkably specific target that could help transform how people age in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial involving 102 prefrail and frail older adults (average age 79) living in 14 retirement communities in the Chicago area. Participants were randomly assigned to either a casual speed walking group or a high-intensity walking group. Both groups completed 48 exercise sessions over 4 months, with three 45-minute sessions per week. Each session included 15 minutes of warm-up and cool-down plus 30 minutes of walking. The casual group was instructed to walk at a comfortable pace, while the high-intensity group was told to walk “as fast as you safely can.” All participants wore thigh-mounted accelerometers during sessions to precisely measure walking cadence (steps per minute). The primary outcome was improvement in 6-minute walk test distance of at least 30 meters, considered clinically meaningful for this population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants in the high-intensity walking group achieved significantly higher walking cadences than the casual walking group (100 vs. 77 steps per minute during the final phase). More importantly, 65% of high-intensity walkers showed meaningful improvements in their 6-minute walk test compared to 39% of casual walkers. The researchers found that increasing walking cadence by 14 steps per minute from baseline comfortable pace significantly increased the odds of achieving functional improvement. When individual cadence changes were accounted for, the group assignment effect disappeared, suggesting that the speed increase itself drove the benefits rather than other aspects of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in retirement communities with motivated volunteers who may not represent all frail older adults. All sessions were supervised by research assistants providing standardized encouragement, making it unclear whether unsupervised participants could achieve similar results. The baseline 6-minute walk distance of approximately 250 meters was well below community norms, highlighting the significantly impaired functional capacity of the study population. The authors noted that all participants were volunteers from retirement communities and were likely motivated, raising the possibility of selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;

Using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy and reinforcement learning tasks, scientists found that high AIC Glx predicted both a general internalizing symptom score and heightened error sensitivity, which mediated this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During reward learning, AIC Glx decreased slightly, indicating dynamic metabolic changes, while the medial prefrontal cortex showed no such effects. These findings suggest that overactive insular glutamatergic signaling amplifies perceived errors, fueling maladaptive thought patterns seen in anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIC Glutamate:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated resting glutamate-glutamine levels in the anterior insula correlate with a general dimension of anxiety and depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Heightened AIC Glx increases the tendency to overweight prediction errors, a cognitive bias linked to internalizing symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; During gain-based learning, AIC Glx levels decrease slightly, reflecting acute metabolic demands, while medial prefrontal cortex levels remain unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research reveals that an overactive anterior insular cortex (AIC), a key hub for integrating emotional and bodily states, may contribute to anxiety and depression by making the brain more sensitive to errors and negative outcomes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, combining cutting-edge brain spectroscopy and computational modeling, links elevated excitatory signaling in the AIC to a common dimension of internalizing symptoms and highlights how this overactivity shapes how we learn from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Brain’s Hub for Feelings and Fears&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior insula sits deep within the brain’s folds and serves as a critical hub for sensing internal bodily signals, monitoring errors, and integrating emotions into decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111724"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Treatments that reduce glutamatergic overactivity in the AIC — whether through medications, neuromodulation, or behavioral therapies — may help dampen maladaptive error sensitivity and improve symptoms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that the AIC is hyperactive in people with anxiety and depression, particularly when processing uncertainty or feedback about mistakes. But why the AIC behaves this way — and how this overactivity might link to the way people with these disorders perceive and respond to errors — has been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glutamate, the brain’s main excitatory neurotransmitter, plays a central role in learning, plasticity, and emotional regulation. Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling has been implicated in psychiatric conditions, with evidence that excessive glutamate activity in frontal brain regions heightens stress responses and emotional reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the AIC’s glutamatergic tone explain why some people seem to overreact to errors, reinforcing worry and rumination?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, researchers recruited 56 healthy young adults to undergo functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) — a neuroimaging technique that can measure concentrations of glutamate and its close relative glutamine, often combined as Glx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed questionnaires measuring symptoms of anxiety and depression, which the team distilled into a single “general psychopathology factor” (or G-score) capturing shared internalizing tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Linking Brain Chemistry to Errors and Emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the MRI scanner, participants performed a computerized decision-making task, repeatedly choosing between two options that carried either rewards or losses. The task was designed to test how sensitive participants were to prediction errors — the difference between expected and actual outcomes, which are crucial for learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, single-voxel fMRS scans measured Glx levels in the AIC and in a comparison region, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), both at rest and during the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Individuals with higher resting Glx in the AIC were more sensitive to prediction errors during the task, both when learning from gains and from losses. They also scored higher on the G-score, indicating greater underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, error sensitivity fully explained the link between AIC Glx and the G-score — suggesting that heightened excitatory signaling in the AIC increases error sensitivity, which in turn fuels internalizing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these effects were specific to the AIC: Glx levels in the mPFC were not related to error sensitivity or symptoms. The AIC’s hyperactive glutamatergic state appears to bias individuals toward overestimating mistakes and negative feedback, feeding into the maladaptive thought patterns common in anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dynamic Changes During Learning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed dynamic neurochemical changes during the task. As participants engaged in reward-based learning, Glx levels in the AIC decreased slightly — perhaps reflecting the metabolic demands of active learning — and remained low afterward. Interestingly, this task-related reduction was specific to gain learning and did not occur during loss-based learning, nor was it observed in the mPFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these transient changes did not disrupt the trait-like elevation of Glx in individuals with higher anxiety and depression symptoms. Even after the task, those with higher baseline AIC Glx still showed greater error sensitivity and higher G-scores, suggesting that the acute dips in glutamate during learning are superimposed on a more stable, elevated excitatory tone that biases cognition and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Does Error Sensitivity Matter?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error sensitivity — the tendency to give disproportionate weight to mistakes or negative feedback — is an important cognitive process. In healthy learning, it allows people to adapt and improve their choices. But when excessive, it can lead to rumination, self-criticism, and avoidance, hallmarks of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that an overactive glutamatergic system in the AIC may amplify how errors are perceived, making each mistake feel more salient and threatening than it should. This overestimation feeds into a cycle of worry and negative mood, providing a mechanistic link between brain chemistry, cognition, and internalizing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIC’s unique role in integrating bodily states and emotions may make it especially prone to “tuning up” error signals when excitatory activity is high. While the mPFC is also involved in mood regulation, its neurochemical activity did not show the same dynamic changes or associations with symptoms, underscoring the AIC’s specific contribution to error-related affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward Better Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights have potential clinical implications. Treatments that reduce glutamatergic overactivity in the AIC — whether through medications, neuromodulation, or behavioral therapies — may help dampen maladaptive error sensitivity and improve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some antidepressants and experimental glutamate-modulating drugs may exert their effects in part by normalizing insular glutamate signaling. Similarly, real-time fMRI neurofeedback training that teaches patients to downregulate AIC activity could help reduce error overestimation and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also exemplifies the value of combining computational models of cognition with neuroimaging and advanced psychometric analysis. By measuring how people learn from feedback, how their brain chemistry shifts during the task, and how these patterns relate to general psychopathology, the researchers have uncovered a specific pathway by which brain chemistry may translate into maladaptive emotion and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitations and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all studies, this one has limitations. The sample was relatively small and limited to young, healthy adults, so the findings need to be replicated in larger and more diverse clinical populations. The cross-sectional design means that causal relationships cannot be firmly established; it’s possible that chronic anxiety and depression also alter insular glutamate levels over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the loss block always preceded the gain block, which may have influenced task-related Glx dynamics. Future studies could counterbalance block order and test longitudinal interventions aimed at modulating AIC glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the findings strengthen the case for targeting insular glutamatergic signaling as a novel strategy to alleviate anxiety and depression, particularly in patients who exhibit heightened sensitivity to mistakes and negative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior insula’s hyperactive glutamatergic system appears to heighten how strongly we feel and react to errors, fueling the worry and rumination that characterize anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uncovering this specific neurochemical pathway, the study provides a clearer picture of how brain chemistry, cognition, and emotion interact — and opens new avenues for treatments that can restore balance to this overactive error-monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the study’s key messages suggests: by quieting the insula’s overexcited error signals, we may help quiet the mind itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression, neuroscience, and anxiety research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1592015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anterior insular cortex glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels predict general psychopathology via heightened error sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;” by Bumseok Jeong et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anterior insular cortex glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels predict general psychopathology via heightened error sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; The anterior insular cortex (AIC) integrates interoceptive, cognitive-emotional, and error-monitoring signals, and is consistently hyperactive in anxiety and depression. Converging evidence links elevated glutamate + glutamine (Glx) in fronto-insular regions to stress reactivity; however, it is unknown whether AIC Glx relates to a transdiagnostic general psychopathology factor (G-score) or to the tendency to overweight prediction errors during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We therefore combined functional MRS (fMRS) with reinforcement-learning modeling to test whether (i) baseline AIC Glx predicts the G-score derived from bifactor analysis of PHQ-9, GAD-7, and STAI-X1, and (ii) task-evoked Glx changes track individual differences in error sensitivity during gain- and loss-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Fifty-six healthy adults (22 ± 2 yr, 16 women) completed the questionnaires and performed a two-armed bandit task (40 loss then 40 gain trials) while single-voxel semi-LASER spectra were acquired from AIC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at rest and during each block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six Rescorla-Wagner variants were fitted to the choices; the best model (based on the lowest LOOIC) included error sensitivity, decision temperature, and value decay. Glx (CRLB &amp;lt; 20%) was quantified using LCModel and analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni-corrected correlations; mediation was assessed using Baron-Kenny steps (α = 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Baseline AIC Glx correlated with the G-score (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.39, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004) and with error sensitivity for gains and losses (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;≈0.41–0.44, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ 0.005); mPFC Glx showed no such relations. AIC Glx fell during gain learning (−2.21%, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.034) and remained low post-task, whereas mPFC Glx was unchanged. Error sensitivity fully mediated the AIC-Glx/G-score link; associations were specific to Glx, not other metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher excitatory tone in the AIC appears to enlarge prediction-error weighting, which in turn amplifies a shared anxiety-depression dimension. Dynamic Glx reductions during reward learning suggest acute metabolic demand superimposed on a trait-like baseline that biaes cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting insular glutamatergic function–pharmacologically or via neuromodulation–may therefore mitigate maladaptive error processing that underlies internalizing psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 13:58:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFA3OWdkenM2SEwzbnNraWp0blFuWEEyTUF5cm0tSGdwZzFiLUtPYXduY1JWUWg3U3BhVEZxMlZPLTl2emltQ1JBcmczQ251NVVXbEhzQ2RoZVVZTzRMdzRra05SOU5tMmlmbGZkN2t3</guid></item></channel></rss>
