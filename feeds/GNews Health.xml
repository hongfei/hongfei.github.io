			&lt;p&gt;If you've ever been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/swimming-in-nature-is-wild-but-is-it-healthier-than-a-dip-in-a-pool"&gt;cold water swimming&lt;/a&gt;, you'll know all about the short, sharp shock it gives your senses as you plunge in. According to a new study, it can pretty quickly change the stress response of your cells too, and in a potentially positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study researchers, from the University of Ottawa in Canada, got 10 healthy young male adults to take a daily cold water dip in their lab for an hour at a time, while using blood samples to measure how their bodies were reacting on a cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week, the volunteers showed signs of improved &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"&gt;autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, a healthy cell recycling process that clears waste. In addition, signs of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis"&gt;apoptosis&lt;/a&gt; (programmed cell death) and inflammation reduced over the week, after initially spiking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156886" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156886" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature.jpg" alt="Core temperatures" class="wp-image-156886 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CoreTemperature-600x381.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156886" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked core body temperature as well as cell response. (King et al., &lt;em&gt;Advanced Biology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that consistent cold water submersion may improve our body's fundamental reaction to environmental stress – in this case, chilly temperatures. Here, it made the key stress response of autophagy more protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were amazed to see how quickly the body adapted," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physiologist Glen Kenny, from the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Cold exposure might help prevent diseases and potentially even slow down aging at a cellular level. It's like a tune-up for your body's microscopic machinery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that the initial exposure to cold water – chilled to 14 °C (57.2 °F) – was more chaotic, with "dysfunction" in autophagy processes and increased apoptosis. It settled down and became more beneficial as the week went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests the body does need time to adapt, but that the adaptation doesn't take long. The body seemed to switch from killing off cells in response to the cold conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/damaged-hearts-may-have-hidden-self-healing-powers-study-finds"&gt;to repairing cells instead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By the end of the acclimation, we noted a marked improvement in the participants' cellular cold tolerance," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physiologist Kelli King, from the University of Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that cold acclimation may help the body effectively cope with extreme environmental conditions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some significant limitations to note here: first, the study only involved 10 people, who were all young men. Researchers are going to need to test this out on bigger groups of participants, including women, to see if the findings apply more generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was also carried out in a very controlled lab setting. There was none of the cold air exposure and variations in temperature that you'd get with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/swimming-in-open-water-poses-a-serious-risk-few-people-know-about"&gt;cold water swimming&lt;/a&gt; for example. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2741/S117"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Previous studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have shown the way our bodies respond to cold air is different to cold water. &lt;/span&gt;These factors may also influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have now found both potential &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/wild-swimming-does-something-amazing-to-your-mind-study-reveals"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cold-water-therapy-might-do-more-harm-than-good-an-expert-explains"&gt;drawbacks&lt;/a&gt; to cold water exposure, but this new discovery could have long-term implications for our bodies: the recycling and cleaning that autophagy takes care of is crucial in preventing disease and limiting some of the wear-and-tear effects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings indicate that repeated cold exposure significantly improves autophagic function, a critical cellular protective mechanism," &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-health-sciences/news-all/cold-plunges-actually-change-your-cells-uottawa-study-finds"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kenny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This enhancement allows cells to better manage stress and could have important implications for health and longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adbi.202400111"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Before being elected governor in 2022, he worked as an emergency room doctor and family physician in Hawaii for over 20 years. While serving as lieutenant governor, he led an emergency medical mission to help stop the measles epidemic in Samoa and led Hawaii’s vaccination campaign during the Covid-19 pandemic, ranked as one of the most effective in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;America’s children are in danger. Measles outbreaks are spreading in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and beyond, threatening lives, overwhelming health-care resources and exposing vulnerable communities. Texas alone has confirmed more than 400 measles cases and the death of the first child from measles in our country in more than a decade: the heartbreaking loss of a school-age child in Gaines County. The outbreaks continue to spread, gaining momentum and posing a threat to children across our country — with one public health official in Texas fearing that the outbreak there could last an entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But this tragic outcome we can see coming doesn’t have to happen. We can prevent it if we act now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is an extremely contagious virus that hospitalizes as many as 1 in 5 of those it infects and kills 1 in every 1,000. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, the United States saw hundreds of thousands of cases every year, many resulting in complications like pneumonia, encephalitis and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Twenty-five years ago, nationwide vaccination efforts had virtually eliminated the disease in the United States by achieving vaccination rates of 95% across the country, establishing herd immunity and preventing the disease from spreading. Today, vaccination rates have been allowed to fall in many states. Experts fear that the elimination of the disease is at risk and that measles may again become a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccination campaigns save lives during outbreaks of deadly viruses. I have witnessed the lifesaving power of vaccines firsthand. During the Covid-19 pandemic – when I was serving as lieutenant governor – we vaccinated over a million people in Hawaii, saving thousands of lives and achieving the lowest infection and mortality rates in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2019, a measles outbreak swept through the island nation of Samoa. The spread of antivaccine misinformation in the previous year had caused fear and uncertainty, which kept many families from vaccinating their children against measles. The result was a devastating outbreak that infected more than 5,000 people and killed 83, mostly children. In December of 2019, I led an emergency medical mission from Hawaii to vaccinate 37,000 people in Samoa over 36 hours, rapidly raising the vaccination rate and helping to end the deadly outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from October, there are 14 states in the US where measles vaccination rates among kindergartners have fallen to dangerously low levels under 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Communities with vaccination rates below the 95% threshold necessary to maintain herd immunity become fertile ground for measles outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, almost 1 in 5 kindergartners entering the school system is unvaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Declining vaccination rates are fueled by the troubling spread of antivaccine misinformation, skepticism and complacency. The top public health official in America, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has suggested that the MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella is not safe. This is false. The measles vaccine has saved an estimated 94 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years, and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the MMR vaccine as safe and effective since 1971.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy also continues to cloud these facts by describing vaccination as a “personal choice” and promoting vitamin A supplementation as a primary response to the measles outbreak. Let me be clear: Vitamin A may lessen measles complications once infection has occurred, but it does not prevent the disease. To suggest otherwise, even implicitly, distracts from the proven, lifesaving effect of vaccines and puts children at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As to vaccination being a “personal choice,” I strongly disagree with Kennedy, and I regard this equivocation as dangerous and irresponsible. It’s much more than a personal choice; it’s a choice to protect not only ourselves but our entire community. As a physician, a governor and a father, I believe it is our moral responsibility to protect vulnerable people by contributing to herd immunity against viral infections through safe and effective vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raynard Covarrubio, left, gives an MMR vaccine to 1-year-old River Jacobs , held by his mother, Caitlin Fuller, at a vaccine clinic held by the Lubbock Public Health Department in March. - Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the face of the current outbreaks, I urge the US Department of Health and Human Services, under Kennedy’s leadership, to act swiftly and decisively. The department must mount an extensive, science-based vaccination campaign to halt the spread of measles and prevent future tragedies. This campaign must focus on four essential pillars: education, community engagement, accessibility and responsible public policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, education is paramount. We must aggressively counter misinformation by providing clear, factual and scientifically grounded information. This approach involves transparent communication regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness and should engage trusted local voices such as health-care providers, educators, faith leaders and community advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second, we must emphasize genuine community engagement. Communities should be active participants in this public health effort, not merely passive recipients. When we engage respectfully, listening to local concerns and responding thoughtfully, we build trust and improve public health outcomes. Community-based approaches have repeatedly proved effective at increasing vaccination rates, and they should guide our current response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Third, accessibility to vaccines must be prioritized. In regions with limited health-care infrastructure, innovative solutions — such as mobile vaccination units, community health fairs and partnerships with local organizations — can bridge gaps and ensure vaccines reach everyone. No one should face barriers of affordability or convenience when it comes to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, we need strong, responsible public policy that balances individual liberties with our collective responsibility. Policies that require vaccination for school entry, excepting legitimate medical exemptions, have historically maintained high immunization rates and protected community health. These regulations must be enforced firmly yet compassionately, recognizing that public safety is paramount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now is not the time for equivocation or delay. We must take urgent action to protect our families and communities. It is our collective moral responsibility to prevent more infection, more suffering and more deaths of American children through our commitment to safe and effective vaccines and public health education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We can stop the deadly spread of measles in our country by launching a sustained emergency vaccination campaign, starting in the states and communities with the lowest vaccination rates and the greatest vulnerability. We have the data. We have the resources. Now we must find the compassion, the strength and the will to do what we know is right and protect America’s children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 13:00:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQMEdpVW5UMkxXWWkyaFFlRjZlQjBhdXA0MVBnR2lhS243bnJrSUI4aFF2RUxabUlaRUVFMjI1YTMwWWpIQkhEZTlqbFR5Q2wwM2NralF1MWlscU5Yd25Wcjg3eEdJeHk1cWlGZDNxWTFmMTNZODI5V2MzUFpmQldOS2dn</guid></item><item><title>Hawaii governor: An urgent call to action to protect America’s children from measles - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOazRTc1QxT1BjcUlwLUJTY2tGUzE2aDJobGNnZlBVVEVrM1JTeGtORFQ0dkxIZ29RNmxndTJsb3BHd095ckNxQkhPaV9oVjZIX0xfaTAwYWNkc2NpYkNPV3VWc1E3ZWx6ZXJENnlGSXp6QTdaQ05NUkc0WmpOUFlSeFBMNHVhUVhzcGR1cDZxN3bSAYcBQVVfeXFMTlEtbWI2Q0o3bXZaLThQLVJfZWNiblNQMGVfRlJGYkZqWGN1REg3dG02T19jQ3RZdWRDUENiNG8yYWd0VVdhRU1lamdVV2p2d2N6WW5MYWhsb3N0Z2tsSEtNR1VIUURvc3QwaDRBYTBNNi0zaDhtX1hCcGotam5JUEFmNGRFVEhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

To suggest otherwise, even implicitly, distracts from the proven, lifesaving effect of vaccines and puts children at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000e3b6ocukg67q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As to vaccination being a “personal choice,” I strongly disagree with Kennedy, and I regard this equivocation as dangerous and irresponsible. It’s much more than a personal choice; it’s a choice to protect not only ourselves but our entire community. As a physician, a governor and a father, I believe it is our moral responsibility to protect vulnerable people by contributing to herd immunity against viral infections through safe and effective vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000f3b6oykdv4a0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the face of the current outbreaks, I urge the US Department of Health and Human Services, under Kennedy’s leadership, to act swiftly and decisively. The department must mount an extensive, science-based vaccination campaign to halt the spread of measles and prevent future tragedies. This campaign must focus on four essential pillars: education, community engagement, accessibility and responsible public policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000g3b6o55d1fjyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, education is paramount. We must aggressively counter misinformation by providing clear, factual and scientifically grounded information. This approach involves transparent communication regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness and should engage trusted local voices such as health-care providers, educators, faith leaders and community advocates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000h3b6oe0rdaogp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, we must emphasize genuine community engagement. Communities should be active participants in this public health effort, not merely passive recipients. When we engage respectfully, listening to local concerns and responding thoughtfully, we build trust and improve public health outcomes. Community-based approaches have repeatedly proved effective at increasing vaccination rates, and they should guide our current response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000i3b6og6ea5feo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third, accessibility to vaccines must be prioritized. In regions with limited health-care infrastructure, innovative solutions — such as mobile vaccination units, community health fairs and partnerships with local organizations — can bridge gaps and ensure vaccines reach everyone. No one should face barriers of affordability or convenience when it comes to vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000j3b6or9nngdxz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finally, we need strong, responsible public policy that balances individual liberties with our collective responsibility. Policies that require vaccination for school entry, excepting legitimate medical exemptions, have historically maintained high immunization rates and protected community health. These regulations must be enforced firmly yet compassionately, recognizing that public safety is paramount.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000k3b6obum1gjgw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now is not the time for equivocation or delay. We must take urgent action to protect our families and communities. It is our collective moral responsibility to prevent more infection, more suffering and more deaths of American children through our commitment to safe and effective vaccines and public health education.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm939b7vk000l3b6o48nwqdcf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We can stop the deadly spread of measles in our country by launching a sustained emergency vaccination campaign, starting in the states and communities with the lowest vaccination rates and the greatest vulnerability. We have the data. We have the resources. Now we must find the compassion, the strength and the will to do what we know is right and protect America’s children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The economic cost of treating and the often uncompensated cost of caring for those sufferers is now more than $600 billion a year. As our population ages, that number will only grow, with one estimate projecting that the number of people with dementia &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/health/dementia-cases-us.html"&gt;will double by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. It is a fate that many of us will one day suffer — according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/health/dementia-cases-us.html"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt;, adults over 55 have a nearly one in two chance of eventually developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this week delivered one of the brightest spots in an otherwise dark field. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x"&gt;study that followed more than 280,000 people in Wales&lt;/a&gt;, older adults who received a vaccine against shingles were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia in the seven years that followed vaccination than those who did not receive the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This could be a big deal. There are very few, if any, treatments that can prevent or slow down dementia, beyond good lifestyle habits like &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia.html"&gt;getting enough sleep and exercise&lt;/a&gt;. The possibility that a known, inexpensive vaccine could offer real protection is enormously meaningful. We have good reason to be confident in the findings: While this study is perhaps the most prominent to show the protective effects of the shingles vaccine, other &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/news/study-suggests-shingles-vaccine-may-reduce-dementia-risk/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine have come to similar conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Beyond the promise of preventive treatment, the new study adds further evidence to a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2025/03/17/do-viruses-trigger-alzheimers"&gt;growing body of research&lt;/a&gt; raising the possibility that we have been thinking about neurodegenerative diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s all wrong. It’s possible these horrible conditions are caused by a virus — and if that’s the case, eliminating the virus could be enough to prevent or treat the diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To understand why the new shingles vaccine study is such a big deal, it helps to know a little bit about how medical studies are carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The gold standard for research is a randomized control trial (RCT). That’s when scientists randomly assign patients to two different groups — one that receives an experimental treatment and another that doesn’t — in order to test the effectiveness of a treatment or intervention. Such RCT trials minimize bias or other complicating factors, allowing scientists to be reasonably confident that any differences between the two groups — like the likelihood of developing a disease — are due to the treatment being studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the real world, RCTs are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.4103/0301-5742.171199#:~:text=This%20is%20one%20of%20the,to%20ensure%20sufficient%20statistical%20power."&gt;often difficult and expensive to carry out&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, you need a large sample size to be confident of your results, and the control group can’t receive the treatment being studied, which creates ethical issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So a lot of big medical research involves observational studies, which is a fancy term for scientists observing things happening in the real world and drawing conclusions from their research. The upside is you don’t need to go through the time and trouble of gathering a big study group and randomly dividing them in two. The downside is you’re much less certain that any observed effect is due to the variables you’re studying because you don’t control the study; you just observe it,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The new study, though, took advantage of a quirk in Welsh health policy to do something better. Beginning on September 1, 2013, anyone in Wales who was 79 became eligible to receive a free shingles vaccine. (Those who were younger than 79 would become eligible once they turned that age.) But anyone who was 80 or older was not eligible on the grounds that the vaccine is less effective for the very old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The result was what is known as a “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/advice-and-guidance/2009/12/social-research-methods-guides/documents/natural-experiments/natural-experiments/govscot%3Adocument/Natural%2BExperiments.pdf"&gt;natural experiment&lt;/a&gt;.” In effect, Wales had created two groups that were essentially the same — save for the fact that one group received the shingles vaccine and one group did not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The researchers looked at the health records of the more than 280,000 adults who were 71 to 88 years old at the start of the vaccination program and did not have dementia. They focused on a group that was just on the dividing line: those who turned 80 just before September 1, 2013, and thus were eligible for the vaccine, and those born just after that date, who weren’t. Then, they simply looked at what happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By 2020, seven years after the vaccination program began, about one in eight older adults, who by that time were 86 and 87, had developed dementia. But the group that had received the shingles vaccine were 20 percent &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; likely to be diagnosed with the disease. Because the researchers could find no other confounding factors that might explain the difference — like years of education or other vaccines or health conditions like diabetes — they were confident the shingles vaccine was the difference maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-new-paradigm-in-dementia-research" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A new paradigm in dementia research?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia.html"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, the research indicates that the shingles vaccine appears to have “some of the strongest potential protective effects against dementia that we know of that are potentially usable in practice.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this is a vaccine originally designed to prevent shingles. Why does it &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; appear to help with dementia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists theorize it could be related to inflammation. Shingles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the same virus responsible for chickenpox, which lies dormant in nerve cells after an initial infection and can reawaken decades later, causing painful rashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That reactivation creates intense inflammation around nerve cells, and chronic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197018624002274#:~:text=Inflammation%20has%20been%20associated%20with,%2C%20chemokines%2C%20and%20adhesion%20molecules."&gt;major factor in cognitive deterioration&lt;/a&gt;. By preventing shingles, the vaccine could indirectly protect against the neural inflammation associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What about the amyloid and tau protein plaques that tend to be found in the brains of people suffering from Alzheimer’s, which have &lt;a href="https://kin.uncg.edu/2025/02/24/plaques-and-tangles/#:~:text=Plaques%20and%20tangles%20block%20communication,detectable%20symptoms%20of%20memory%20loss."&gt;long been thought of as the primary cause of the disease&lt;/a&gt;? It’s possible that these may actually be the body’s response to an underlying infection. That could help explain why treatments that directly target those plaques &lt;a href="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2024/03/13/why-alzheimers-plaque-attack-drugs-dont-work/"&gt;have been largely ineffective&lt;/a&gt; — because they weren’t targeting the real causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As promising as the new research is, we’re still a long way from finding a silver bullet against Alzheimer’s and dementia. One &lt;a href="https://recruit.cumc.columbia.edu/studyinfopage/1179"&gt;double-blinded RCT&lt;/a&gt; — the gold standard of the gold standard in medicine — that is underway now is examining whether valacyclovir, an antiviral used against the virus that causes shingles, could slow cognitive decline in people with early-stage Alzheimer’s. That would be a true game changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOdGVRSFF2aG4xTGpjVmxuTkdkN3RxcE1wNXZvRVhUcUMxX2x5dnpsQUNreFpuX193TnYzQkEzcTRUdjNIRGFJVFdrTGg2Y29Rc0ZEZ0JjZzI5TTV4c2lpVGw4b3NtVzJQT01vRWRVT2lJQnlrN2luQnJQVDR1YVRkVm5wU18xSlUyMnM0QlZXYTNtbGk2eTJz</guid></item><item><title>Test Shows Alcohol Causing Long-Term Brain Damage - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9PbVE0ZGFKTkhEZFJZQXN4WFVBWkR0NzBPVnhVZnlWZFRZelllelE1NnVYWjQ3V19WTDVZVkU5QlRSRGZIZVZGTGhoUDBMZ0I1M0N6dk1IMWRMWVlyS2t3Rk8zemltVjg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In new rat studies, scientists have found grim evidence of just how badly alcohol impairs cognition — even after sobering up months prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to new, federally-funded research out of Johns Hopkins, the decision-making parts of the brain appear, even after months of sobriety, to be highly impacted by large amounts of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As detailed in a new paper published in the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt0200" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hopkins neuroscientist and addiction researcher Patricia Janak and her students first exposed a cohort of rats to very high quantities of alcohol vapor, followed by a nearly three-month-long period of withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After drying out, the rats that were given the booze vapor — along with a control group that had abstained — were subjected to a "reward-based decision-making test." The test involved pressing one of two levers to get a water droplet with some sugar in it — a simple task that rats learned how to do quickly to get their sweet treat. To complicate the game, however, the researchers would switch reward levers every few minutes, prompting the rats to figure out the timing of switches to get the reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a difficult task that required memory and strategy," noted a &lt;a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/04/02/how-alcohol-abuse-damages-cognition/#:~:text=Bloomberg%20Distinguished%20Professor-,%22We%20now%20have%20a%20new%20model%20for%20the%20unfortunate%20cognitive,studies%20the%20biology%20of%20addiction." class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;statement about the research&lt;/a&gt;. "The alcohol-exposed rats performed considerably worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers contend that their results are the first of their kind because prior alcohol studies that used animals did not "demonstrate deficits in rapid decision-making" the way theirs did. This was likely due to the decision-making tests being too easy, the scientists claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our experiment was quite challenging, and the alcohol-exposed rats just couldn't do it as well," Janak, the paper's first author, said in the Hopkins statement. "When the right answer was constantly changing, the control rats made the best decisions faster. They were more strategic. And when we looked at their brains, the control rats' decision-related neural signals were stronger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team linked the alcohol-exposed rats' difficulties with the tests to "dramatic" changes in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain that governs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/dorsomedial-striatum" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;motor function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3273324/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;behavioral decision-making&lt;/a&gt;. A known center for reward and expectations, the dorsomedial striatum has long been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00028/full" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;associated with addictive and compulsive behaviors&lt;/a&gt; — but this study seems to be the first to ever show just how much the neural circuits had been damaged by booze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the researchers indicated that they were surprised that the brain damage from alcohol lasted so long, which "may give us insight into why relapse rates for people addicted to alcohol are so high," Janak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcohol-induced neural deficits may contribute to decisions to drink even after going to rehab," the neuroscientist said. "We can clearly demonstrate these deficits can be long-lasting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the cognitive effects were only present in the male rats that were studied and not their female counterparts. While there's no reason to believe females aren't subject to alcohol-related brain damage, this finding suggests, per the Hopkins press release, that there "could be sex-related sensitivities in long-term alcohol effects on brain function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it does seem &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-dont-rats-get-the-same-ethical-protections-as-primates" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;kind of cruel&lt;/a&gt; to get rats so plastered that they suffer brain damage — especially when there are plenty of human alcoholics out there who would be willing to be studied.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="146" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dqu39002j3572okzr07zz@published"&gt;While I was dating my college boyfriend, my sister started to date his brother. My relationship started getting rocky, and I had a choice between starting a new job in a different city or working on my relationship. My boyfriend was adamant that I not take the job and stay here with him. I made the mistake of staying. We broke up a year later because I found him cheating on me. My sister was still dating his brother and they ended up engaged. It was very difficult for me to be around my sister and her fiancé. After they got married, holidays were even worse. I struggled but moved on. Well, several years later, they are in the process of getting a divorce. And my brother-in-law just decided to nuke my relationship with my sister by sending me a taunting text containing a major shock.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="25" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dodx2004jr7m7ge3bis67@published"&gt;In it, he revealed his brother had been cheating on me a long time before I found out, and my sister knew all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ep002o3572jg5t7554@published"&gt;I called my sister in tears and she confessed. I screamed at her. She was the one that encouraged me to stay and skip my chance at a new job. I called her a selfish whore and said that I considered her dead to me now. In the aftermath, our parents are more upset at me for adding more stress to my sister than about what happened to me. They say it was years ago and that I am overreacting. This has me so sick that my doctor put me on anxiety medication. I don’t know how to go on from here.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7eq002r35720qpp0haz@published"&gt;Don’t let the terrorists (these two awful brothers) win. It’s not fair that your boyfriend cheated on you, and it’s even worse that your brother-in-law went out of his way to hurt you on his way out the door. I’ll be transparent about my agenda here: I don’t want this story to end with the two bad guy exes living happily ever after and enjoying each other’s company while you and you and your sister have to cope without each other. You say “My BIL decided to nuke my relationship with my sister” —but his whole plan fails if you don’t let him do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="224" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7eq002s357292jmy4mx@published"&gt;Also, totally separate from my desire for a narrative in which the terrible men don’t come out on top, I think your relationship with your sister is worth saving. Yes, it’s fair to be upset with her, to wish she’d made a different choice with regard to telling you about the cheating, and to need some time to get over it. But her behavior doesn’t rise to “selfish whore who is dead to me” levels. People often write to me often asking for advice on whether to tell a loved one that their partner is being unfaithful. It’s a common dilemma because this is a situation in which it’s really hard to know what the victim of infidelity would want. While some are grateful for the intel, plenty of others become outraged at the deliverer of bad news. I’ve made the case before that when there is cheating, there are almost always clues and that person in the relationship could pursue if they truly wanted to know, so there’s no obligation to inform them. But whether to speak up is a legitimately tough call—one about which good, kind people can disagree. Sometimes I think we should get ahead of the issue by giving our friends and family instructions about whether we’d want to be informed if they ever suspected that our partners were cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="196" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7et002t3572pd02myan@published"&gt;What you’re experiencing is real pain and distress, and I would never agree that you’re overreacting or that the time that’s passed means you should be over it. But I suspect your response might be more about how much being cheated on all those years ago hurt you—and your shame over making a “mistake”— and less about what your sister knew and when. I hope the anti-anxiety medication is helping, and I wonder if it will give you the mental space to process what happened in your relationship, why you made the choice you did, and how you can forgive yourself for staying in a city with a guy who turned out not to be worth it. That’s a totally understandable (and extremely common) decision. And it’s worth noting that it did not ruin your life. I hope you can make peace with it and see it as part of your journey rather than something that derailed you completely. If you can do that, you may begin to see your sister is also someone who has made missteps but isn’t defined by them, and perhaps the two of you can figure out your next steps together.&lt;/p&gt;

I walk with a cane and have difficulty standing, etc., due to a bad accident. The other day, I went to put laundry in (there are two medium-sized washers). One had finished, and the empty one rejected my laundry card, so I simply emptied the done one into a cart. A new neighbor came and was upset that I “touched his laundry and didn’t wait for him.” I thought maybe he didn’t realize normal etiquette and that I use a cane. He was still demanding an apology. I said write a note to the board. I refrained from saying he had poor manners. I don’t feel obligated to teach a grown, able man what entitlement is. Your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev002z35722ucb2jl6@published"&gt;Your neighbor should know that if you use shared laundry facilities and don’t want anyone to touch your clothes, you need to either bring some work or entertainment and set up shop in the laundry room so you’re there when each load is done, or implement a very good alarm system to remind you to run down and grab your stuff. (If you’re waiting for a machine, it’s considerate to give the current user maybe five minutes after the buzzer to show up, but no longer.) That’s the rule! And even if he’s truly confused about how this works, he should have extended some empathy to you and the fact that you can’t comfortably stand around waiting for people to remember that they’re washing clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev00303572m73qi66x@published"&gt;You were right and he was wrong. But forget the lesson on manners and entitlement. In the same way that we all have to be responsible for our own clothes and not our neighbors, his bad personality is his business, and it’s not your job to provide guidance on how to be a considerate human being. “Write a note to the board” (a polite way of saying “Take it up with someone who cares, and by the way, they’re not going to be on your side”) was the perfect response, and you should use it again if you find yourself in this situation in the future. But I suspect your neighbor’s horror at having his wet clothes touched might have been the reminder he needed to time his loads better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="157" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ev00333572y8knb4qg@published"&gt;I come to you fresh out of a nearly year-long relationship. I started dating “B” just shortly after coming out, and he was my first relationship. Things were peachy, save for a few disagreements here and there. When I say I’m fresh out of this relationship, it’s more “raw” than “minty.” It wasn’t my decision. My boyfriend, after months of sharing our personalities, time, and baggage, told me that his anxiety was making our relationship “suffocating” and that he would need to move on to take better care of his mental health. I had known about his anxiety and worked to foster an environment where he could feel honest about how he’s feeling and share whatever he felt comfortable with. The problem, however, is that he still held back. He said that he tried to sweep it under the rug throughout our relationship, but the kettle was boiling and he just couldn’t ignore the whistle any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex003435727g0md1y3@published"&gt;The shock hit me like a silver bullet. How could the man I love decide to stumble out of a relationship rather than grant me the opportunity to talk though his pain? How do I even know if his intention to seek help was genuine? Was it really his anxiety that suffocated our relationship, or was it me? These questions and any number like them still own my mind over a month later.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ex00353572vr6bmmt3@published"&gt;Now, we’re no-contact and according to what little information I have available (through social media), he’s positively enjoying his relationship-free life. He leaves no sign of the anxiety that reportedly damned our relationship, and he certainly doesn’t let it get in the way of clubbing, concerts, and other fun outings. Is he just sweeping it under the rug again? Is there any hope of us reconnecting? And, if there is, will I just end up getting burned again?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ey00383572xlpy5c5n@published"&gt;Sure, there’s hope that you might reconnect. People break up and make up all the time. But I encourage you not to pursue that. Block him on Instagram, and consider the relationship over. Forever. This advice is based on a few rules that I think apply to your situation:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="24" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ey00393572itbf2s62@published"&gt;- No-contact should include no following on social media (which, by the way, doesn’t provide an accurate representation of anyone’s mood or mental state).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003a35723t9o9gna@published"&gt;- People are allowed to break up with you with no due process, for reasons that aren’t fair or honest or don’t make sense or are based on their own weird stuff and poor choices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003b3572s70tbdra@published"&gt;- It’s a bad idea to chase someone who doesn’t want you.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="182" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm93dr7ez003c3572gnao4a6f@published"&gt;I know it’s not as simple as simply deciding to be done, and when someone doesn’t hold up their end of the relationship or share their true feelings, it can feel disorienting, and even like an injustice. You’re allowed to hate the way things turned out between the two of you and be frustrated that he didn’t work harder to address his mental health and nurture his connection with you at the same time. Rant about it to your friends, invite them to rant about it back to you, journal, scream—do whatever you need to. Except trying to reconnect with him. Instead, try to tap into the part of you that was eager to be in an open, supportive, healthy relationship and start to think about looking for someone who wants the same and is willing to work as hard as you are to make it happen. After all, if you were so invested in a relationship with a guy who found it suffocating, imagine how much better it will be when you find someone for whom being your partner is &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;easy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I really do not want to be poly, and having kids in a few years (I’m 28 now, he is 30) is really important to me. But I feel regret and wonder if I should get back together with him and if this is just a big struggle we have to overcome. He is dating his crush already, and she is poly. Since he met her, he is convinced that being poly is the thing that will make him happy. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/02/dear-prudence-sexist-demand.html"&gt;Should I try to fight for us? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mediterranean diet is filled with foods that can help with weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians’ top Mediterranean diet weight-loss foods are lentils, Greek yogurt, chickpeas, nuts and leafy greens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These foods are rich in nutrients that help with weight management, like protein and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291120/mediterranean-diet-for-beginners-everything-you-need-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet &lt;/a&gt;has long been celebrated as one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world. So, it’s no surprise that it’s also linked to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This diet emphasizes whole, nutrient-dense foods like fresh produce, hearty whole grains, beans, healthy fats and small amounts of lean protein. And it’s low in added sugars, red meat and highly processed foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike restrictive diets that may feel unsustainable, the Mediterranean diet is more of a lifestyle approach, focusing on balance and enjoyment. That, in turn, may make it easier to stick with over time. What makes this diet even more appealing for weight management is its sheer variety of healthy, satisfying foods that naturally help you eat less. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, there are lots of foods to choose from. So, we asked dietitians which Mediterranean diet foods stand out for weight loss. Here are their five favorites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-lentils"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Lentils &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for a versatile, nutritious food to incorporate into your meals, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8041388/are-lentils-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt; are an outstanding choice. What makes them so powerful for weight loss? “Lentils are an excellent source of plant-based protein, and they are high in fiber, both nutrients that help keep you satiated and keep blood sugar levels stable,” says &lt;a href="https://jessicalevinson.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Jessica Levinson, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a culinary nutrition expert in Westchester, New York. One cup of cooked lentils has 16 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Combined, these may help reduce overall caloric intake, thereby promoting weight loss, says Levinson. For instance, one study found that people who ate more legumes, like lentils, had lower BMIs and smaller waistlines and were less likely to gain weight over 10 years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Known for its tangy flavor and rich texture, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt; is a Mediterranean diet staple that supports weight loss thanks to its high protein content and gut-friendly probiotics,” says Orlando-based dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. This thick, creamy dairy product is made by straining regular yogurt to remove excess whey, resulting in a concentrated protein content. One single-serve 5.6-ounce container of nonfat plain Greek yogurt provides an impressive 16 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That protein helps with weight loss in multiple ways, such as reducing appetite and increasing calorie-burning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The probiotics in Greek yogurt also improve gut health, which is increasingly linked to better weight regulation and reduced inflammation,” explains Katz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; No wonder research has found that yogurt, as part of a balanced and healthy diet, may help prevent and manage obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to wholesome and convenient Mediterranean diet–friendly snacks, few foods are as satisfying and nutritious as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;. “Nuts, like almonds and walnuts, are an essential Mediterranean diet food to have on hand,” says &lt;a href="http://www.inutritioncenter.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and owner of Integrated Nutrition for Weight Loss. “They’re packed with healthy fats, fiber and protein to help you stay full longer, making them a great snack for weight management.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re worried about their fat, you can relax. Evidence finds that even though nuts are high in fat, eating them doesn’t lead to weight gain. Instead, the opposite is true. A wide body of research shows that nuts may help with weight control and prevent long-term weight gain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, nuts are a fantastic grab-and-go snack. But there are so many tasty ways to incorporate them into meals and snacks, like our five-star &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/268714/savory-date-pistachio-bites/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Savory Date &amp;amp; Pistachio Bites&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccolini-amandine-8416052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Broccolini Amandine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267223/walnut-rosemary-crusted-salmon/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Walnut-Rosemary Crusted Salmon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole fruits and vegetables are the foundations of the Mediterranean diet. While all produce is a win for weight loss, green leafy vegetables have decided benefits. Leafy greens, like spinach, kale and Swiss chard, are naturally low in calories, rich in fiber and high in volume. So, they fill you up with negligible calories. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spinach is, perhaps, the most noteworthy leafy green in the Mediterranean diet. With a mere 7 calories per cup, this satisfying green provides fiber, iron, vitamin C and folate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In addition, spinach contains compounds called thylakoids that may also support weight management by helping the body use insulin more effectively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet offers a sustainable, enjoyable, nutrient-dense approach to healthy eating and weight management. By including a variety of wholesome foods like lentils, Greek yogurt, chickpeas, nuts and green leafy vegetables like spinach, you can create satisfying meals that support your health goals while celebrating the vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean region. That said, there are &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of foods to choose from. If you’re new to the Mediterranean diet, start small by incorporating a few of these foods into your daily meals and experience how delicious and nutritious eating can truly be.

So, once again, not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is fiber?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber comes from whole fruits and vegetables, which most people under-consume, Mullins said. Additionally, many folks turn to white flour, white bread and white rice instead of their whole-grain alternatives, and fiber is stripped when companies make these white-flour versions, said Elnakib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber is the part of the food that we don’t normally digest, so humans can’t digest this part of the food, and so it’s often in plant-based foods,” Elnakib said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s two kinds of fiber, she explained. Soluble fiber can be dissolved in water, “and basically that part of the fiber creates kind of like a gel-like substance when you eat it and it’s in your gut,” Elnakib said. “That actually pulls all of the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/high-cholesterol" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cholesterol" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/topic/high-cholesterol" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, the fat and the sugars in your gut so they don’t enter your bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other kind of fiber is insoluble fiber, which is “that other part of the food that we cannot digest ... Think about the skin of an apple or a blueberry skin,” Elnakib said. “What they do is really just create bulk in our stool and soften our stool so that we have easier bowel movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s important to eat enough fiber every day ― and you’re likely not getting the recommended amount. Below, experts share the signs that you’re not eating enough fiber and explain how to add more of it to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You’re regularly constipated. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number one sign that someone has an inadequate fiber intake is constipation,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/lon-ben-asher" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Lon Ben-Asher" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.pritikin.com/lon-ben-asher" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Lon Ben-Asher&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at Pritikin Longevity Center in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inadequate fiber intake makes it a lot more difficult for stool to pass through the GI tract, and it creates more infrequent bowel movements,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, fiber helps add bulk to the stool, which in turn “helps food pass through the gastrointestinal tract a lot easier,” Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You get hungry again soon after a meal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the signs that you may not be consuming enough fiber is if you feel hungry shortly after eating,” Mullins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because you’re eating foods, such as sugars and refined carbs, that are absorbed quickly, she said. “One of the great benefits of fiber... is that it really helps to make you feel full and to feel full longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because fiber isn’t very digestible, it can kind of sit in our stomach for a while and slow down the absorption of other nutrients, which is one of the ways that it helps to regulate blood sugar,” Mullins noted. “But what this also does is helps us to feel full and feel full longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You have stomach discomfort.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another sign you aren’t eating enough fiber? Uncomfortable digestive symptoms like cramping, bloating and gas can be a red flag, said Ben-Asher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dietary fiber helps maintain a very, very healthy gastrointestinal tract,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: The Good Brigade via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;The Good Brigade via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Beans and legumes are a great way to get your daily fiber.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can eat more fiber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since you find fiber in plants, [you] could eat more plant foods, and [you] could eat plant foods that they can recognize as plants,” Mullins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole veggies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans and legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just for reference: 2 tablespoons of chia seeds have 10 grams of fiber, 1 cup of lentils has 18 grams of fiber, 1 cup of broccoli has 5 grams of fiber, 1 cup of whole wheat pasta has 7 grams of fiber, and 1 cup of blackberries contains 7.5 grams, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/high-fiber-foods" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s really important for people who don’t consume enough fiber... to kind of go slow and steady,” said Ben-Asher. “You want to gradually increase your fiber intake, because if you go from a very low-fiber to a very, very high-fiber diet, the gut and the body is not used to it, and so it has to assimilate, and it takes time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who dive in too quickly may notice issues like gas, bloating, stomach discomfort, constipation and more, Ben-Asher added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gradually increasing fiber slowly can really help your body adjust to it and reduce those risks of those side effects,” he said. “So, ways that we encourage people to do it is try to increase your fiber intake by adding one more serving of vegetables per day, [and] trying to increase fruit consumption, so maybe even having one more serving of fruit per day as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, think about the carbohydrates you’re eating. Instead of eating ultra-processed carbs, opt for items you can pick from a garden, such as sweet potatoes and beans, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And instead of eating white bread or white rice, choose breads and grains that are whole-grain, Elnakib said. But be careful not to just pick out bread or grain that’s dyed brown, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re looking at whole-grain products, actually look at the back and make sure that it is made from whole grain versus just brown products because that’s not always the same,” Elnakib explained. Make sure you’re “looking at the back and you’re checking to see that it says ‘whole grain flour’ or ‘whole grain sorghum wheat’ or pasta or whatever it is that you’re using ... Multi-grain is great, too, because then you get different kinds of whole grains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber supplements can be helpful, but they aren’t the same as fiber-rich food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may be easy to take a dietary fiber pill or powder, it’s not necessarily as effective as eating fiber from a plant source, Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think in certain situations, taking a supplement can be effective and helpful to certain people,” he said. “But the science and the research and the evidence-based literature does not support that getting fiber from a supplemental source has the same impact on our health as consuming fiber from real whole plant foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of going to the store to pick up a fiber supplement, spend that time looking up &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/high-fiber-recipes/rcs-20077194" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="fiber-packed recipes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67eeb2dfe4b0479c31ffedef" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/recipes/high-fiber-recipes/rcs-20077194" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;fiber-packed recipes&lt;/a&gt; like bean salads, chili, split pea soup, whole wheat pasta with veggies and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s important for people really to try to focus a little bit more on their dietary approach and adding fiber from food, as opposed to from a lot of the supplements that people take,” Ben-Asher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re concerned about your fiber intake, consider talking to a dietitian.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to cooking the same low-fiber meals, it can feel overwhelming to make the switch. A registered dietitian can help you come up with recipes and decipher just how much fiber you’re regularly eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might ask you to keep a food log of everything you eat from anywhere from three to seven days,” Mullins said.

While some of these microbes cause illness and disease (such as bacteria and viruses), others are friendlier to us and help keep us in good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is one of these friendly bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for years that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is associated with good health. One of the important roles it plays in our gut is maintaining the function of our gut barrier. This keeps the bad bugs out while making sure we can still absorb the important nutrients from our diet that keep our cells working as they should. But when there’s an imbalance of &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in the gut, it can lead to problems with our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unusual bacteria lives in our large intestine and survives off of mucin — the layer of mucus that covers the large intestine’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucin provides a small but important separation between the human cells and microbial cells that call the large intestine home. If this mucus layer is disrupted, microbes can come into direct contact with the human cells. This may result in inflammation as the human cells react to the bacteria – potentially leading to the development of disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is a very fussy eater. It only uses the glycoproteins (molecules containing protein and carbohydrates) in mucin as an energy source. But just how this bacteria extracted energy from glycoproteins was a mystery until recently. Research conducted by myself and colleagues discovered that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; deploys a range of different enzymes that work together in order to unlock the sugar found in mucin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mucin taken from a pig, we analysed both enzyme activity on the surface of cells alongside their genes to understand which enzymes were involved in breaking the glycoproteins in mucin down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; uses 66 different enzymes to extract the important energy it needs from the glycoproteins in order to do its important work. We are the first group to describe this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Important for health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies looking at &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila’s&lt;/em&gt; interaction with the immune system in mice have revealed that it calms the immune system down and may prevent obesity and diabetes from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have highlighted specific peptides (a type of molecule) that it secretes which have this effect on the immune system. Due to its friendly nature and calming effect on the immune system, &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; has even been used to develop probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also found that people who have a metabolic disease, such as diabetes or fatty liver disease, have fewer &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in their large intestine. The more lean and athletic you are, the more &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; only eats mucus, our diet does still affect it – though indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon-dwelling bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; use the carbohydrates they extract from the fibre-rich foods in our diet as fuel. In return they produce substances called short-chain fatty acids. These compounds feed the top layer of human cells in the colon. In fact, 10 per cent of our energy comes from this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 hHPRtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The bacteria lives in the large intestine" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 iwFOdi inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-4345"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 vXhNB"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;The bacteria lives in the large intestine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; also supports other bacterial species in the microbiome by giving them broken-up mucus so they can survive – a process known as “cross feeding”. But, if we don’t eat enough fibre as part of our diet, mucins become a much more heavily used source of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to the depletion of the large intestine’s mucus layer – throwing the microbiome’s delicate ecosystem out of balance. This increases the chance of developing inflammatory diseases. So, although &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is not a pathogen, it can remove too much mucus under the wrong conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research is the first complete example of how mucus is broken down by this bacterial species. It’s important to understand this process, as it’s key in the way our microbes interact with each other – and with us. The enzymes that we described from &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; can now also be used as tools to analyse how these complex mucin structures vary across different body sites and between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more researchers learn about &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; and the other microbes that live in the colon, the more we understand the importance of eating a variable, high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucy Crouch is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Microbiology and Infection, Department of Microbes, Infection and Microbiomes, School of Infection, Inflammation and Immunology, College of Medicine and Health at University of Birmingham.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

We could call room service when hungry and spend the day admiring the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was tempting, but we headed downstairs to explore the spa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we considered never leaving the suite, exiting the spa was even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the 21,500-square-foot spa was the most impressive pool I've ever seen. Unsurprisingly, the pool had views of the Dolomites. Half of it was indoors, and the other was outdoors. Guests could swim between the two through sliding glass doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area also had loungers, daybeds, a water station with small snacks, a sauna, and a steam room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hallway led to another wing of the spa, which had two more indoor saunas, one at 185 degrees Fahrenheit and another at 158 degrees. There was a cold plunge, a silent room with a fireplace, and a tea lounge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A door led outdoors to the fifth sauna, which was tucked inside a traditional South Tyrolean wooden house, and a second outdoor cold plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While access to these amenities is included in the stay, the property's spa also offers treatments like massages, facials, scrubs, and manicures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When she saw photos of the characteristic red rash on practice board exams, she flipped back through her textbooks to figure out what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Most practicing doctors, in today’s day and age, are not going to see it in real life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But in the past few months, Dr. Myrick, a family medicine doctor in Seminole, Texas, has treated about 20 people with measles. She is likely to see more cases, as a raging outbreak that has infected 481 people in Texas and killed one child continues to spread. In Texas, New Mexico and other parts of the country where cases have emerged,&lt;span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;health care workers like Dr. Myrick are confronting the highly contagious virus for the first time. On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_10-measles-cases-in-2025" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reported 607 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the U.S. this year — more than double the number of cases seen in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The generation of physicians who are currently, for the most part, treating patients haven’t actually seen what a measles case looks like other than from a textbook or a video,” said Dr. Andy Lubell, chief medical officer of True North Pediatrics in Pennsylvania, where a physician diagnosed the practice’s first ever measles case this March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000. Cases still pop up around the country each year, sometimes seeding larger outbreaks. But public health experts worry that this year, measles could become &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/health/measles-outbreak-texas.html" title=""&gt;more common in more places.&lt;/a&gt; The virus is spreading rapidly in some parts of the country, and vaccination rates nationwide have &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html" title=""&gt;been falling for years.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I remember learning about measles, German measles, all these things,” said Dr. Seth Coombs, a doctor at the Lovington Medical Clinic in New Mexico who saw his first measles case this year. “But you just don’t see them. And so like anything, if you don’t use it, you lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles can sometimes be hard to recognize at first, especially if a doctor doesn’t think to look for it. The infection causes a telltale red rash, but it can take days to appear. Before that, someone with measles might have only a fever, cough, a runny nose and red, watery eyes — symptoms that mimic the signs of many other viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of New Mexico researchers studying the health risks posed by gadolinium, a toxic rare earth metal used in MRI scans, have found that oxalic acid, a molecule found in many foods, can generate nanoparticles of the metal in human tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Magnetic Resonance Imaging&lt;/i&gt;, a team led by Brent Wagner, MD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine in the UNM School of Medicine, sought to explain the formation of the nanoparticles, which have been associated with serious health problems in the kidneys and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The worst disease caused by MRI contrast agents is nephrogenic systemic fibrosis," he said. "People have succumbed after just a single dose." The condition can cause a thickening and hardening of the skin, heart and lungs and cause painful contracture of the joints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gadolinium-based contrast agents are injected prior to MRI scans to help create sharper images, Wagner said. The metal is usually tightly bound to other molecules and is excreted from the body, and most people experience no adverse effects. However, previous research has shown that even in those with no symptoms, gadolinium particles have been found in the kidney and the brain and can be detected in the blood and urine years after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are left with intertwined puzzles: Why do some people get sick, when most don't, and how do gadolinium particles become pried loose from the other molecules in the contrast agent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Almost 50% of the patients had been exposed only a single time, which means that there's something that is amplifying the disease signal," Wagner said. "This nanoparticle formation might explain a few things. It might explain why there's such an amplification of the disease. When a cell is trying to deal with this alien metallic nanoparticle within it, it's going to send out signals that tell the body to respond to it."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In their study, Wagner's team focused on oxalic acid, which is found in many plant-based foods, including spinach, rhubarb, most nuts and berries and chocolate, because it binds with metal ions. The process helps lead to the formation of kidney stones, which result when oxalate binds with calcium. Meanwhile, oxalic acid also forms in the body when people eat foods or supplements containing vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In test tube experiments the researchers found that oxalic acid caused minute amounts of gadolinium to precipitate out of the contrast agent and form nanoparticles, which then infiltrated the cells of various organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some people might form these things, while others do not, and it may be their metabolic milieu," Wagner said. "It might be if they were in a high oxalic state or a state where molecules are more prone to linking to the gadolinium, leading to the formation of the nanoparticles. That might be why some individuals have such awful symptoms and this massive disease response, whereas other people are fine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding points to a possible way to mitigate some of the risks associated with MRI scan, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't take vitamin C if I needed to have an MRI with contrast because of the reactivity of the metal," Wagner said. "I'm hoping that we're getting closer to some recommendations for helping these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is now researching ways to identify those who might be at greatest risk from gadolinium contrast agents. In a new study they're building an international patient registry that will include a collection of blood, urine, fingernail and hair samples, which could provide evidence of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gadolinium/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gadolinium&lt;/a&gt; accumulation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want to get a lot more information to come up with the risk factors that relate to those with symptoms," he said. "We're going to ask about what medical conditions you had at the time of exposure, what medications are you on, and we want to include &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+supplements/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary supplements&lt;/a&gt;, because that might piece it all together—why some people have symptoms, whereas others seem to be impervious."&lt;/p&gt;

There's no consensus on the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;definition of biological age&lt;/a&gt; or how to measure it, so it differs according to the test he refers to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verdin said he believes &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/worked-out-every-morning-for-a-week-challenge-2023-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;exercising for an hour each day&lt;/a&gt; has made the biggest difference to his health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I rarely take a day off. On that day off, I just miss it because I realize it optimizes everything else," he said. "If you're looking for an anti-aging drug that the Buck Institute is going to come up with in the next few years, it is probably going to be 10 years before we have anything that comes remotely close to exercise and physical activity," Verdin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He works out every day, doing a mixture of cardio, strength training, and mobility exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c49af111-1ef4-4cb3-b74c-4a69f1e84099" data-toc-id="c49af111-1ef4-4cb3-b74c-4a69f1e84099"&gt;Hot pilates four to five times a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It hits all the notes that I need to hit," Verdin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves doing strength training exercises such as squats and pushups with small weights in the heat, which both challenge the muscles and make the heart and lungs work, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that doing a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weight-lifting-and-cardio-may-help-you-live-longer-study-2022-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;combination of weight lighting and cardio&lt;/a&gt; is best for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a large 2022 study published in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2022/08/08/bjsports-2021-105315.info" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from the National Cancer Institute examined data from nearly 100,000 older US adults. They found that participants who did resistance training once or twice a week as well as cardio, had a 41% lower risk of dying from chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease when compared to sedentary participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who did 150 to 300 minutes a week of aerobic exercise were, on average, 32% less likely to die from any cause during the course of the study. And resistance training was linked to 9% lower mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;

All the drinks were cherry flavoured, so the participants did not notice the difference, and each of them was exercising their own control over the consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order of the drinks was random for the participants, with the gap between the sessions ranging from two days to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that artificial sweeteners are effective for weight loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This resulted in an increased blood flow to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that helps control the appetite and cravings. However, when the same participants drank a beverage containing sucrose, also known as table sugar, there was a hunger-decreasing effect. The peripheral glucose levels spiked, and this corresponded with reduced blood flow to the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hours after consuming sucrose, participants reported significantly lower hunger levels than when they consumed sucralose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The result&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of the research suggest that non-caloric sweeteners may not actually be useful for losing weight or reducing the cravings for sugar. Additionally, they seem to change how the hypothalamus communicates with the rest of the brain.

However, it creates a "mismatch between the expectation of caloric intake and the absence of actual energy," explained the authors of the study. "If your body is expecting a calorie because of the sweetness, but doesn't get the calorie it's expecting, that could change the way the brain is primed to crave those substances over time," warned Kathleen Alanna Page, a supervisor of the study and endocrinologist from the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 40% of American adults regularly consume these sugar substitutes, as per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31395-8/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, unaware of their ironical effects.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TARRANT COUNTY, Texas — Tarrant County Public Health (TCPH) announced Friday that a person who visited two Grapevine locations between March 28 and 30 has tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a news release from TCPH, the person visited Great Wolf Lodge, located at 100 Great Wolf Drive, between early Friday, March 28 and Sunday, March 30. TCPH said the person also walked around Grapevine Mills Mall and ate at the food court on Saturday, March 29. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you were at either of these locations during the specified dates and are not vaccinated against measles or are unsure of your immunity, you may be at risk of contracting measles," TCPH said in the news release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH said that it is working with the Texas Department of Health Services Regional Office and others to monitor the situation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 450 cases of measles have been reported in Texas, &lt;a href="/article/news/health/first-measles-case-reported-in-rockwall-county/287-f81ab0fd-e9dc-42fd-a25a-22f0e420a456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;including six here in North Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and a child in Lubbock &lt;a href="/article/news/health/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;has died from the virus&lt;/a&gt;, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 13, officials with the Paris-Lamar County Health District &lt;a href="/article/news/health/4-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-paris-lamar-county/287-f9b565ea-4146-43dd-95a8-638ffae2fb74" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;confirmed five cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/article/news/health/first-measles-case-reported-in-rockwall-county/287-f81ab0fd-e9dc-42fd-a25a-22f0e420a456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Rockwall County reported one case &lt;/a&gt;in late February.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were exposed at the venues during the dates listed, TCPH recommends that you monitor yourself for measles symptoms through April 20. These symptoms include a fever above 101 degrees, cough, runny nose or conjunctivitis, followed by a red, blotchy rash that begins at the hairline and behind the ears, then goes further down the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH said if you experience any of these symptoms, stay home and call your healthcare provider for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or two after someone is exposed. A few days later, the telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;A person is contagious about four days before the rash appears to four days after. People with measles should stay home from work or school during that period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Symptoms of Measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Common symptoms of measles include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Runny nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Some vaccinated people can occasionally develop measles; however, they generally experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;What to do if you've been exposed to measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;If you think you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving to be tested so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing other people to the virus. Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus. Review your and your child’s vaccination history to see if you are up-to-date on your measles vaccines. Additionally, discuss with your provider your vaccination history and any questions about these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;Controlling outbreaks in group settings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;People with confirmed or suspected measles should stay home from school, work, and other group settings until after the fourth day of rash onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;During an outbreak, people without documented immunity from vaccination or previous measles infection should be isolated from anyone with measles to protect those without immunity and control the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;According to the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Rule §97.7, schools and childcare settings shall exclude unimmunized children for at least 21 days after the last date the unimmunized child was exposed to a measles case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div original-article-post="" class="group-source-title" data-v-4fbf7207 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;p class="group-source-paragraph" data-v-4fbf7207&gt;&lt;b data-v-4fbf7207&gt;The Source:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this article comes from Tarrant County Public Health, Great Wolf Lodge and the Texas Department of State Health Services update on Friday, April 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 03:11:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE1mMTV2LURWOFREc1dfNm5hOVZUY0pjWDhMR1E4NDNaLXRfZmdySy1VaUR5ZUcxQWdxODNRdU9udmNuWGw2S3cyNk9rUDYyckYxYndzOElFc0x6bWszVmFEVVVaZ9IBaEFVX3lxTE5YTDRMSjhna21MSFdEMHctS1lfbmlCVWNoRlcwMjJtc0VoZVBFellWNWE1ckc1ci1GTkI5aEdnWk1rT2FMbkEydW1iZHEtWHNIR0xhS2RuUFpEZi1qemozelZlRkVOUVNL</guid></item><item><title>Multivitamin to magnesium: 3 most common vitamin supplements that can land us in danger - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAJBVV95cUxQeDhlT3YtVFR3YUFja3lZR0tkYXktcUM3SXpOQmRKc1ZoWE8wRVFaYjRDX2FhNFUtYUpJZEZ1QV8xVmJHc1RrMjctdWtpN1UzV1VfM1B1V3JEeVhhNUVDMzA4cGxYZG5oeFJrbkp6RlNjcDdkVmpkenZlcFo0Um9adHRxQlMyWk95TnpyNW96NENzYTcweXhUUHhvX1RYeTg4NjNPdnp5bGhReEtrT1JjUmpzeGlzc1JJNm9Wc0tOcC1sek8yVTJoV2VMbmZueF9KYWFjMzExTXo3TEV2Z21ZWjBHNndmakVDNEN5MGd4Y0pUc3pOWEloZmJsUVhVWnZFTERIVzhpQTVxX3pCOHF1TmgycTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all want to stay healthy, and taking vitamin supplements might seem like a quick and easy way to fill the nutritional gaps. But here’s something surprising—not all supplements are as safe or helpful as they seem. In fact, some of the most common ones can silently mess with our gut health and leave us feeling worse over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our gut is like the command center for our overall well-being. It’s not just about digestion—it also impacts our mood, immunity, and even our energy levels. But when certain synthetic supplements disrupt this delicate system, they can trigger problems you never expected. Here are 3 such vitamin supplements, as per Dr Janine Bowring, ND, a naturopathic doctor that we should watch out for and what you can do instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Synthetic multivitamins: A cocktail of trouble for our gut&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many over-the-counter multivitamins are synthetic. If you look at the ingredient list and see names like Vitamin A as Retinyl Palmitate or Vitamin B6 as Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, that’s your red flag. These are lab-made versions, not the kind your body naturally gets from food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which do you believe is better for gut health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These synthetic forms can irritate your gut lining, disturb the balance of good bacteria, and in some cases, even overload your liver over time. They’re harder for the body to break down, which means instead of absorbing nutrients, your body ends up struggling to detox them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What you can do instead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go for whole food-based multivitamins. These are made from concentrated food sources and are much gentler on your digestive system. Even better, try to get most of your vitamins from real foods like leafy greens, fruits, seeds, and nuts. Nature does it best!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B12: A sneaky gut irritant&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is essential for energy and nerve health—but here’s the catch. If our supplement label says cyanocobalamin, it’s a synthetic version that contains a tiny amount of cyanide. While the dose is low, regular intake can affect detox pathways and may irritate our gut and liver, especially if our body is already under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t stop there. People with gut issues like IBS or low stomach acid may not even absorb this form of B12 properly, so it just adds to the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to choose instead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always look for methylcobalamin or hydroxocobalamin—these are more natural, bioavailable forms of B12. Also, try to include more B12-rich foods like eggs, dairy, and fish in our diet. Fermented foods like curd can also help with gut health while improving B12 absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It sounds harmless, but it can be a silent disruptor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305453403_Delay_effect_of_magnesium_stearate_on_tablet_dissolution_in_acidic_medium" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; suggest that magnesium stearate can create a biofilm in the gut, which prevents proper nutrient absorption. It may also reduce the effectiveness of probiotics and harm the gut’s protective barrier over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s a better choice?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for supplements without fillers or additives like magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, or artificial colors. Brands that say “clean label” or “additive-free” are a safer bet. Again, choosing nutrients from whole foods is the gold standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;The Importance of a Strong Digestive Fire for Holistic Health in Ayurveda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to fall into the supplement trap, especially with the attractive labels and tall claims. But your gut health is too precious to risk. Just because something is labeled as a “vitamin” doesn’t mean it’s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always read the labels, question what's inside, and when in doubt, choose food over pills. If you’re unsure, speak to a qualified nutritionist or functional medicine expert to figure out what your body truly needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, less is more—and a clean, nutrient-rich diet can give you far better results than a shelf full of synthetic supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxQeDhlT3YtVFR3YUFja3lZR0tkYXktcUM3SXpOQmRKc1ZoWE8wRVFaYjRDX2FhNFUtYUpJZEZ1QV8xVmJHc1RrMjctdWtpN1UzV1VfM1B1V3JEeVhhNUVDMzA4cGxYZG5oeFJrbkp6RlNjcDdkVmpkenZlcFo0Um9adHRxQlMyWk95TnpyNW96NENzYTcweXhUUHhvX1RYeTg4NjNPdnp5bGhReEtrT1JjUmpzeGlzc1JJNm9Wc0tOcC1sek8yVTJoV2VMbmZueF9KYWFjMzExTXo3TEV2Z21ZWjBHNndmakVDNEN5MGd4Y0pUc3pOWEloZmJsUVhVWnZFTERIVzhpQTVxX3pCOHF1TmgycTg</guid></item><item><title>5 nurses who work on the same floor at Massachusetts hospital have brain tumors - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPd1EyajhKRVNrQndzbWh3SjhwdGNqcUllSEFCLUdhS3BLUTV6alFhNTROcGRVUkpPOHRUMlNFNEg4cFJNMFFwdGdMcllrQ1lrS25uNVFJa0Q4OGFRalhaS3RJT2NKLUdUVjMyWk9DWUNuWVpMWS1MTXdtQzJTVFhmQTBVOUdjWXhrQjY0QjNrZzIyZzF3OW5HZ1BSaW9yTTlrZEYyNE9R0gFWQVVfeXFMTmthaWl1S3VlVENua2JKb2pqNl9lQ1FBbDd5d3NTSkpUNlkzcV9zcThsYnM4T2hHdzlZZV9nUjdTXzhBWF91T2FqaW1fWk9PbVpuR3dSUHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Boston-area hospital is investigating after five nurses who have worked on the same floor have developed brain tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital said that in total, 11 employees from the fifth-floor maternity unit identified health concerns.

	&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;For a child who is not vaccinated against measles — one of the world’s most infectious viruses — no classroom, school bus or grocery store is safe. Nine out of 10 unvaccinated people exposed to an infected person will catch it, and once measles takes root, the virus can damage the lungs, kidneys and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;falling U.S. vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; that have caused more than 580 cases and at least one death, health experts expect measles to infect hundreds or even thousands more across the nation. Here is how measles takes over the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Unlike viruses that require person-to-person contact, &lt;strong&gt;measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; lingers in the air &lt;/strong&gt;for up to two hours after the person carrying it has left the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block" aria-label="graphic"&gt;   &lt;div class="g-block g-block-margin svelte-rhgw2n g-margin-inline"&gt;&lt;div class="g-block-width g-max-width-body svelte-rhgw2n"&gt; &lt;div class="g-wrapper_meta g-text-align-center svelte-v3m00m"&gt;  &lt;p class="g-note svelte-v3m00m"&gt;Droplets are enlarged for illustration purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;A child can inhale virus-containing droplets in a room where another child — unknowingly infected with measles — has been studying or playing an hour earlier. The virus can enter her body through the lining of her nose or mouth, or when she’s rubbing her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;During the subsequent 24 hours, &lt;strong&gt;the virus takes root&lt;/strong&gt; by lodging in her nasopharynx cells in the upper part of the throat and starts spreading to her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Then, &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he virus takes over&lt;/strong&gt;, multiplying inside the cells and building up an army for an attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper g-linebefore svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper g-linebefore svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Within a few days, the virus begins to spread to infect the nearby lymphoid tissues. About a week after the initial exposure, infected cells begin traveling to other organs throughout the body. (At this time, the immune system of a vaccinated child would recognize the virus and fight it off.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Typically, during the replication and spread of the virus, the child does not feel sick. The average incubation period is about two weeks — though it can range from one to three. When the viral load has increased significantly, it moves to infect other cells of the lungs and eyes, making the child feel ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;A couple of weeks after the unvaccinated child inhales the droplets, &lt;strong&gt;she starts feeling sick&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Children often first show signs of malaise and a fever, followed later by reddish, irritated eyes, a cough and a stuffy nose as the mucus membranes and nasal passages become inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Some children at this stage develop millimeter-wide, whitish-gray bumps on the inner lining of the cheeks, as far back as the molars. For some, the spots go undetected, or do not show up at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Then comes the characteristic feature: the breakout of a red rash, starting on the face and spreading down the neck, trunk, and extremities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Many of these symptoms should resolve themselves. The rash can last up to a week, often fading along the same route it appeared. The cough can last for up to two weeks after the illness has resolved. But a fever lasting beyond the third or fourth day of the rash suggests that a complication could be developing — and that is where cases can become dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Even as the rash fades, the infection can spread to the lungs and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Children are typically brought to the hospital after having the body rash for several days. Most have low oxygen levels and are laboring to breathe and need support, said Dr. Summer Davies, who sees children at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, and has been treating measles cases there since the outbreak started in late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;“A lot of families have kind of been surprised, like, ‘Oh, my child was fine, and then all of a sudden, they're not,’ ” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;That mild disease evolves into a fever as high as 104 or 105 degrees for two, three or four days. Poor fluid intake, a sore throat and diarrhea can lead to dehydration, which over time can begin to threaten kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Young children are more at risk because of their smaller anatomy and their inability to articulate symptoms clearly, explained Dr. Lara Johnson, the chief medical officer of a group of Covenant hospitals in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;About one in 20 children with measles will develop &lt;strong&gt;pneumonia&lt;/strong&gt;, an infection in the lungs; and severe cases can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Dr. Davies said many children admitted to her hospital recently had cases of pneumonia caused by either the measles virus or by a second pathogen that attacked while their immune systems were weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;The 6-year-old girl &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html"&gt;who recently died of measles&lt;/a&gt; in Texas had a case of pneumonia that caused fluid to build up in her left lung, making it difficult for her to breathe, according to a video interview with her parents that was posted online. She was eventually sedated and intubated, but she became too sick to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;One of the hallmarks of measles is what researchers call “immune amnesia,” the temporary weakening of the immune system.

The mortality rate approaches 95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Erica Finkelstein-Parker, a mother in Pennsylvania who lost her 8-year-old child Emmalee to the condition, had not known that the girl had had measles before she had been adopted from India as a toddler. But she noticed one day that Emmalee was tripping and falling, slumping over to one side of her chair and struggling to lift her chin off her chest during dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Doctors explained that there was no cure. Emmalee passed away about five months later.&lt;/p&gt;

Fifty-six people have been hospitalized in the area since the disease started spreading in late January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, a center with approximately 230 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, the outbreak began on March 24, when a little girl who had been sick with fever and vomiting tested positive. She later needed to be hospitalized for pneumonia and trouble breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kids who have tested positive at the day care so far are between the ages of 5 months and 3 years old, said Maegan Messick, a co-owner of the center. None was fully vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For nearly two weeks, Messick has been working with local health officials who are in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the situation. Messick said she’s not been given clear guidance on how to handle measles in such a large day care with so many vulnerable kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“From what I’m being told, the CDC doesn’t have a playbook for this,” Messick said. “We’ve just had to make judgment calls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The U.S. is facing the largest measles outbreak in six years, but the CDC has remained relatively silent on the public health threat, providing just weekly updates on its website and sending &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" target="_blank"&gt;an alert to doctors&lt;/a&gt; last month. The agency sent 2,000 doses of the MMR vaccine to Texas health officials at their request, but hasn't held a news briefing about measles since 2019, when &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-measles-count-rises-764-driven-new-york-outbreaks-n1002311https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-measles-count-rises-764-driven-new-york-outbreaks-n1002311" target="_blank"&gt;two large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; threatened to reverse the United States’ status of having eliminated the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is over CDC, did not respond Friday to a question about whether any briefings were in the works to address the current measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It was unclear whether mass layoffs at HHS and CDC this week might stymie such efforts. But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;steep funding cuts to community health departments&lt;/a&gt; announced last week have already forced some areas to cancel vaccine clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-dallas-vaccines-hhs-funding-cuts-rcna199144" target="_blank"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt;, for example, had to cancel more than 50 clinics. Many had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to an NBC News tally, 628 measles cases have been reported nationally in 2025. Other states with outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 54 cases. Public health officials in Ohio have identified 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The cases at the Lubbock day care center are likely linked to the epicenter of the outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, said Lubbock's public health director Katherine Wells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wells said she’s been concerned about cases spreading in child care centers since the beginning of the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think we’ll have additional outbreaks in other day care centers,” she said. “This isn’t going to be the only one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Messick, of the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, said she and her staff are trying to reduce risk of further spread by watching kids closely for symptoms and isolating certain classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They’re also urging other child care facilities to encourage their families to get the MMR vaccine. Families who choose not to vaccinate their children have been asked to keep them home for at least 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two doses are almost always enough to give lifetime protection against measles, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Unvaccinated people who are exposed to the virus are almost certain to become infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The first dose isn’t usually given until after a child’s first birthday, but can be offered early, at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“That’s the best that child care owners can do right now,” Messick said. “It’s coming. There’s no way around it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 22:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPNHVyREJrMXdOcnM2QkozTXBDdm1ydGNGMERRa1lyWjFuLTV2Y2pBcTlSbWFqZTd0SEx6ZHR6NFRSZXpaZkNjNUVzRURUMUN0SDRXUE0xa0k3S1A3empiVF9qOGs1YkFUNV8zQ3pxdFNPREtsd1owcjZJczVyc2ljaDBVczJZY2l5QXVRdE0ydFJRWnlPa3BGeG1EQXVBYjV2X3fSAVZBVV95cUxOLUExMm4tOWlpUW1QS3lRdC1YblhCemY4SzdoOExBV2lkQVd4bHdFaEVwckRIcFJad2N0elJvbTFUMnNmOFZ5eEhPNGVmcnRKWmF6OXlEUQ</guid></item><item><title>Female Hormones Trigger Pain Relief via Immune Cells - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5MdUxrM1gyQ180eU85cmpJeXNhaVE5RTZDQnhpOUFBVDJsN011X1E4M2N2dGJFdTc0M09yTEZFdjhlc0ZrOVo5RExVNzVDYjRPcEZ4RU15aUV1cUstcmpqTTJ3VWJYdWE4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have discovered that female hormones like estrogen and progesterone can trigger immune cells near the spinal cord to release natural opioids, easing pain before it reaches the brain. These immune cells, known as T regulatory cells (T-regs), are located in the meninges and produce the painkilling molecule enkephalin in response to hormonal signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect appears specific to females, offering insight into why some pain treatments work better for women and why postmenopausal women may experience more chronic pain. This newly uncovered mechanism could lead to sex-specific therapies and innovative treatments for the millions affected by chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormone-Driven Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Estrogen and progesterone prompt T-regs to release natural opioids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Female mice without T-regs became more pain-sensitive; males did not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Engineered T-regs may offer a new approach for chronic pain relief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have discovered a new mechanism that acts via an immune cell and points toward a different way of treating chronic pain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female hormones can suppress pain by making immune cells near the spinal cord produce opioids, a new study from researchers at UC San Francisco has found. This stops pain signals before they get to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could help with developing new treatments for chronic pain. It may also explain why some painkillers work better for women than men and why postmenopausal women experience more pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108393"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman in pain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers have begun looking into the possibility of engineering T-regs to produce enkephalin on a constant basis in both men and women. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work reveals an entirely new role for T regulatory immune cells (T-regs), which are known for their ability to reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that there’s a sex-dependent influence on these cells – driven by estrogen and progesterone – and that it’s not related at all to any immune function is very unusual,” said Elora Midavaine, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow. She is the first author of the study, which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears April 4 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at T-regs in the protective layers that encase the brain and spinal cord in mice. Until now, scientists thought these tissues, called the meninges, only served to protect the central nervous system and eliminate waste. T-regs were only discovered there in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we are showing now is that the immune system actually uses the meninges to communicate with distant neurons that detect sensation on the skin,” said Sakeen Kashem, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is something we hadn’t known before.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That communication begins when a neuron, often near the skin, senses something that could cause pain. The neuron then sends a signal to the spinal cord.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the meninges surrounding the lower part of the spinal cord harbor an abundance of T-regs. To learn what their function was, the researchers knocked the cells out with a toxin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was striking: Without the T-regs, female mice became more sensitive to pain, while male mice did not. This sex-specific difference suggested that female mice rely more on T-regs to manage pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was both fascinating and puzzling,” said Kashem, who co-led the study with Allan Basbaum, PhD. “It actually made me skeptical initially.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments revealed a relationship between T-regs and female hormones that no one had seen before: Estrogen and progesterone were prompting the cells to churn out painkilling enkephalin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how the hormones do this is a question the team hopes to answer in a future study. But even without that understanding, the awareness of this sex-dependent pathway is likely to lead to much-needed new approaches for treating pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short run, it may help physicians choose medications that could be more effective for a patient, depending on their sex. Certain migraine treatments, for example, are known to work better on women than men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be particularly helpful for women who have gone through menopause and no longer produce estrogen and progesterone, many of whom experience chronic pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have begun looking into the possibility of engineering T-regs to produce enkephalin on a constant basis in both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If that approach is successful, it could really change the lives of the nearly 20% of Americans who experience chronic pain that is not adequately treated,” Basbaum said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other authors on the study include Beatriz Moraes, Jorge Benitez, Sian Rodriguez, Joao Braz, Nathan Kochhar and Walter Eckalbar of UCSF, Lin Tian of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, Ana Domingos of University of Oxford and John E.

&lt;p&gt;These security protocols represent part of a broader strategy for maintaining website integrity. Just as &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/at-24-she-reveals-how-she-saved-90000-to-retire-by-40/"&gt;financial planning requires protective measures&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard assets, websites implement these barriers to protect their digital infrastructure from potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-389191795"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding that these blocks are automated rather than personal can help reduce frustration when encountering them. The system operates on predefined security rules without human intervention in most cases, which occasionally results in false positives.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Common triggers for security blocks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several factors can trigger Cloudflare’s security mechanisms when attempting to access leboudoirdubienetre.fr. Identifying what might have caused the block can help you avoid similar issues in the future. Security systems often flag activities that deviate from typical user behavior patterns.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific phrases or keywords within your search queries or form submissions may activate security alerts. The system monitors for expressions commonly associated with hacking attempts or automated scraping tools. Similarly, any input resembling database commands will immediately trigger protective measures, as these often indicate potential SQL injection attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/26/the-worlds-richest-youtuber-mrbeast-says-anyone-would-be-unhappy-living-the-lifestyle-he-has/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;The world’s richest YouTuber, MrBeast, says anyone would be “unhappy” living the lifestyle he has.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rapid page requests or browsing multiple pages quickly can appear suspicious to security algorithms. The system may interpret this behavior as bot activity rather than human browsing. Even using certain browser extensions or VPN services can sometimes trigger these security responses.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your IP address history also plays a role in determining access permissions. If your network has previously been associated with suspicious activities, even unrelated to your personal actions, you might face additional scrutiny. This shared responsibility approach to network security resembles how &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/02/this-is-the-exact-amount-of-exercise-you-need-per-week-to-effectively-lose-weight/"&gt;consistent exercise habits contribute to overall health goals&lt;/a&gt; – both require ongoing vigilance and proper practices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Steps to resolve access restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When faced with the “Attention Required!” message on leboudoirdubienetre.fr, several practical solutions can help restore your access quickly. The most direct approach involves communicating with the website administrators about the issue you’re experiencing.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact the site owner via email to explain the situation. Include detailed information about what you were doing when the block occurred. This context helps them determine whether the security system responded appropriately or if adjustments are needed. Remember to include the Cloudflare Ray ID displayed at the bottom of the error page, as this specific identifier helps administrators trace exactly what triggered the security response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/20/a-nutritionist-reveals-the-exact-amount-of-dark-chocolate-to-eat-daily-to-reap-its-benefits/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;A nutritionist reveals the exact amount of dark chocolate to eat daily to reap its benefits.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While waiting for a response, try some basic troubleshooting steps. Clear your browser cookies and cache, which might remove any data patterns that triggered the security alert. Switching to a different browser or disabling browser extensions can also help determine if these factors contributed to the block.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a VPN service, temporarily disabling it might resolve the issue. Security systems sometimes flag traffic from VPN servers due to their shared nature and previous user activities. Waiting a short period before attempting to access the site again can also be effective, as temporary blocks often reset automatically after a cooling-off period.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Preventive measures for smooth website access&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking proactive steps can significantly reduce your chances of encountering Cloudflare security blocks when visiting leboudoirdubienetre.fr or similar protected websites. Implementing these practices helps establish your browsing activities as legitimate and trustworthy to security systems.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable cookies for websites you regularly visit. Security systems often use cookies to distinguish between legitimate users and potential threats. Blocking cookies might prevent the site from recognizing you as a returning visitor, potentially triggering security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/10/better-than-nordic-walking-this-grandpa-sport-is-perfect-for-burning-fat-with-minimal-effort/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Better than Nordic walking, this “grandpa sport” is perfect for burning fat with minimal effort.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avoid rapid page refreshing or unusual browsing patterns that might appear automated. Navigate through websites at a natural pace, similar to how you would read content offline. Be cautious when submitting forms or search queries containing technical terminology that might resemble code or commands.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your devices free from malware provides another layer of protection against security blocks. Infected devices might exhibit suspicious behavior patterns without your knowledge. Regular security scans and system updates help maintain clean browsing conditions and prevent your legitimate activities from being misinterpreted as threats.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these security measures contextualizes them as necessary protections rather than arbitrary obstacles. By adapting your browsing habits slightly, you can enjoy smooth access to leboudoirdubienetre.fr while still benefiting from the robust security that Cloudflare provides against genuine threats.

Two of the nurses had the same type of tumor, a meningioma, and the other three had different types of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As part of the hospital's investigation, 11 staff members came forward to be interviewed, including the five nurses diagnosed with brain tumors and six others with unspecified “health concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor," the hospital said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another investigation led by the Massachusetts Nurses Association is ongoing, the group tells TODAY.com. A spokesperson said they have been contacted by over 300 people, mostly current and former employees at the hospital, regarding the investigation. The group expects the investigation may "additional weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"The hospital only spoke to a small number of nurses and their environmental testing was not comprehensive," the association's statement read in part. "While we currently cannot release specific numbers or other diagnosis information, we are committed to being transparent about our findings when we have finished verifying the information we collect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Massachusetts Nurses Association's investigation is being conducted by the group's division of health and safety in collaboration with nurses working at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Newton-Wellesley Hospital's investigation was conducted with the Department of Occupational Health and Safety, the Newton-Wellesley Safety Officer, radiation and pharmaceutical safety offices, and other health and environmental experts, per their statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Every staff member who came forward was given the opportunity to be interviewed by the Occupational Health and Safety team to evaluate each diagnosis in the context of their individual medical history and risk factors," the hospital statement said. "To evaluate for any possible environmental exposures in that area of the hospital, comprehensive environmental assessments following CDC guidelines began in December." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the hospital, the investigation included tests of the hospital's water and air quality. The facility's water is tested regularly, but additional testing results are still pending; air quality was found to be normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The investigation also examined levels of radiation around the fifth floor and the pharmacy's ventilation system, and looked at possible risks from X-ray use policies, construction, cleaning products, mold and pest control measures, and it found no issues, the hospital said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Based on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team members at Mass General Brigham/Newton-Wellesley Hospital and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility," the hospital said in its statement.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Growing older can take a toll on your hearing, but even more than your age, a new study has revealed another biological factor that may influence how your ears respond to sound: your sex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;international study&lt;/a&gt;, "women consistently exhibit higher sensitivity" to loud clicking noises at low, mid, and high frequencies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ear is stimulated in this way, researchers found the hairs inside the cochlea of women were two decibels more sensitive, on average, than the cochlear hairs of men. While this may not be noticeable to an individual, it is measurable in a cochlear test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings provide "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;compelling evidence&lt;/a&gt;" that the inner ears of women are more sensitive to sounds than the inner ears of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Age is a well-established factor in the decline of cochlear sensitivity," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by evolutionary biologist Patricia Balaresque from Paul Sabatier University in France. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, in our study, the effect of age is overshadowed by sex and environmental factors."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; a click test called Transient-Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE), researchers analyzed the cochlear sensitivity of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; 448 healthy participants from five different countries: Ecuador, England, Gabon, South Africa, and Uzbekistan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In all the analytical models the team ran, sex was the main biological factor explaining inter-individual differences in TEOAE results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Age came second.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the authors turned to non-biological factors, they found where a person lived had a greater impact on their cochlear sensitivity than their age. Those who live in forest environments, for instance, tend to outperform those in high-altitude or urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings challenge existing assumptions and highlight the need to consider both biological and environmental factors when studying hearing," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/study-shows-women-can-hear-better-than-men/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Balaresque.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying drivers behind natural hearing variation will improve our understanding of hearing loss and individual differences in noise tolerance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.412231"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; indicates that as males age, they lose their hearing twice as fast as their female counterparts, and that is especially true for higher frequency sounds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MAO.0000000000002507"&gt;&lt;span&gt;still don't understand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; why that is. Some have proposed that men are exposed to more damaging noises in their lives, which could exacerbate age-related hearing loss, but these new results suggest sex differences in cochlear sensitivity cannot simply be explained by age or by environmental exposure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some previous studies have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.3037231"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that women exhibit subtle yet higher sensitivity on TEOAE tests when the click is at least above 2,000 hertz (Hz), while other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5038496"&gt;&lt;span&gt;studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1044/2018_AJA-17-0106"&gt;&lt;span&gt;no differences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; between the sexes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This field of research remains relatively unexplored, but Balaresque and her colleagues have now put forward a few hypotheses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sex differences in cochlear sensitivity, they explain, could be due to hormone exposure during early-life development, possibly influencing how tiny hairs in the cochlea form, gather, and respond to sound. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Women also tend to perform better in other tests of hearing, which suggests they may have "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;superior&lt;/a&gt;" inner &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; outer ear function compared to men. Whether that is due to cultural or biological factors needs more research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We don't really know why this might be, but given the detrimental effect of noise on overall health such as sleep quality and increased cardiovascular disease, having more sensitive hearing in noisy environments may not always be a good thing," &lt;a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/announcements/study-shows-women-can-hear-better-than-men/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; evolutionary biologist Turi King from the University of Bath in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is one of the first detailed investigations of what influences the sensitivity of the human inner ear using a diverse cohort with a variety of ethnicities and languages considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The robust sex-based differences the authors identified now need to be studied further. Identifying what drives hearing loss and noise tolerance will be essential when it comes to tailoring hearing &lt;span&gt;aids&lt;/span&gt; to diverse populations, the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92763-6"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The deaths — all occurring within the first few months of 2025 — mark an unusual spike in &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/what-is-hantavirus-the-infection-that-killed-20209371.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;hantavirus &lt;/a&gt;activity and have raised alarm among public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A third case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), each of which has been fatal, is tragic and alarming,” said Dr. Tom Boo, a Mono County public health officer, in a &lt;a href="https://monocounty.ca.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/county_administration/page/34452/pr_mono_thirdhantavirus_4-3-25_final.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t have a clear sense of where this young adult may have contracted the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="Inline-1" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases occurred despite no major rodent infestations in the homes of the three deceased, all who lived and worked in Mammoth Lakes, the release said. In each case, health officials did find mice in the workplace, which they don’t consider to be unusual, though no definitive exposure site has been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should pay attention to the presence of mice and be careful around their waste,” Boo said, noting that these recent deaths did not involve the typical risk factors, such as cleaning enclosed spaces with visible droppings, that have previously been associated with infection. He said he’s also “worried” about the timing of the deaths since hantavirus cases usually come in late spring or summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus is contracted by inhaling particles from the droppings, urine, or saliva of infected deer mice, a species common in the Eastern Sierra, the release said. The virus does not spread from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the California Department of Public Health, 93 state residents have been infected with hantavirus from 1980 through 2024, with 79 of those cases traced to specific exposure locations within California. Mono County has recorded 27 cases since 1993 — more than any other county in the state — including six involving visitors, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus begins with flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, nausea, and abdominal pain. A cough usually develops only later, and shortness of breath often signaling the onset of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The disease can progress rapidly, with death occurring within one to two days of respiratory decline in severe cases, and roughly one-third of infected individuals die, the Mono County release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness made national headlines earlier this year when Betsy Arakawa — the wife of actor Gene Hackman — died from hantavirus in their New Mexico home.

The World Health Organization said last week that cases in Mexico were linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2000 had been declared eliminated from the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The outbreak in Texas began more than two months ago. State health officials said on Friday there were 59 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to 481 across 19 counties – most of them in west Texas. The state also logged 14 new hospitalizations, for a total of 56 throughout the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than 65% of the Texas cases are in Gaines county, which has a population of 22,892, and where the virus stated spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county now has logged 315 cases since late January – just over 1% of the county’s residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 20:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFB3RHpqbkRlYldYQkJZbTRMdU1kSlEyNmlXSTR4XzVjZ3pmdHM4MHo0eWVhOExfZzFTVUZTOHNPTEhaZWdEVFQ1YjhQS3V3R0dGNzdRZDlQbmt4VVJOS3c5elhZRlE4Y1Q5TWRCNmRaSWJnQzhkcnJZ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Just Discovered a Huge Health Benefit of Blueberries - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNSnpjX1VVTVJYVW9EX2VjQkwwQmF2cllybExVUncwdElYUEtUWWo3b1hMVVJhY2M2YTlVQnhhSVZKNHdHUUI2VE9vR3VOdG9pZzRqZFRDanVkeUtMYXR6SThGQV9hdmhNNUNSR2xaVnVpeFBYRmZQczhNV1JITDJYZA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people are already aware that eating blueberries and other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-rich-vegetables-for-diabetes-8678207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; is a simple and effective way to support different aspects of our health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blueberries are rich in polyphenols, especially anthocyanins, which not only give them vibrant color but also support heart health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. These compounds improve blood vessel function, help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;balance cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and lower risks related to heart and metabolic diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a crucial role in overall health, can be positively influenced by the polyphenols in blueberries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

According to researchers, incorporating more blueberries into their diet is one promising approach for better health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; explored how the simple act of adding blueberry powder to the diet can impact gut bacteria and blood markers connected to heart health in older adults who are overweight or have obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having a better idea of what may happen when older adults simply &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-lemon-blueberry-dessert-recipes-11701396" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat more blueberries&lt;/a&gt; can help uncover new strategies to improve gut health and reduce the risk of heart-related issues with little effort.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study, called The Blueberry Enhances Activity and Cognition Through Increased Vascular Efficiency (BEACTIVE) study, was a 12-week research trial that investigated how eating blueberries and exercising could benefit older adults' physical activity and brain health. The study included men and women over 60 years old who were not very active and had a body weight that ranged between overweight and moderately obese. Participants also needed to have normal heart rhythms and blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. People with certain health conditions, recent infections, or who were on specific medications were not included in the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A total of 55 participants were selected and randomly divided into two groups. One group consumed a drink made from blueberry powder twice daily, while the other group consumed a similar-looking placebo drink. Both groups also followed an exercise routine. By the end of the study, 48 participants completed the program. The amount of blueberry powder consumed was a quantity equivalent to about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries each day, divided into two ¾ cup servings consumed with meals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the beginning of the study, participants' diets were analyzed to understand their nutrition and berry intake using online tools and questionnaires. To ensure a clear understanding of how the treatment worked, participants followed a two-week "washout" period before the study began, where they avoided eating berries, grapes, cherries and other foods high in specific nutrients found in berries. Every participant also wore a fitness tracker for a week to measure their daily steps, and they gradually increased their step count throughout the study, working towards being more active.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Key health indicators, such as heart and blood vessel function and blood pressure, were measured at the start and end of the study. Researchers also kept track of physical activity and reviewed diets monthly. Additionally, blood and stool samples were collected at the start and end of the study to analyze gut bacteria and other health-related factors.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking at cholesterol, fats and other important compounds in the blood after 12 weeks, researchers found that people taking the placebo powder experienced significantly lower total cholesterol, LDL (called “bad”) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol. Markers for the number and size of LDL particles and a protein linked to cholesterol, ApoB, also significantly decreased. On the other hand, people taking blueberry powder had lower levels of total HDL particles (the "good" cholesterol) and a protein called ApoA-I linked to HDL. In other words, they experienced positive outcomes when it came to their heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When comparing the two groups, additional differences were noted. For the group on blueberry powder, there were changes in specific cholesterol particle numbers and sizes, such as smaller LDL cholesterol particles in the fasting state and lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol and other markers after meals, known as the postprandial state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, this study shows how additions like blueberry powder can impact cholesterol and related blood markers differently compared to a placebo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study also found that among the study subjects, eating a diet that included powdered blueberries led to an increase in a specific type of gut bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Coriobacteriales incertae sedis&lt;/em&gt;. This increase wasn’t seen in those who didn’t consume the blueberry powder. These bacteria are known to help break down and absorb beneficial compounds found in blueberries, suggesting that the body adapts to better digest the nutrients from blueberries when they are a regular part of the diet, per the study authors. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has some important limitations to consider. One major one was the small size of the groups that had both gut microbiome data and advanced blood biomarker analysis. Since the sample size is so small, it limits the ability to generalize the findings to a broader population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors also note that while the placebo and treatment groups were well-matched in terms of age, gender, race and BMI, they noticed that the placebo group showed different responses, which could be due to participants changing their behavior because they knew they were part of a health study. This might explain some of the positive effects seen in the placebo group. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also worth noting that this study was funded by the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those of us looking for ways to support our heart health, adding blueberries is a delicious and simple place to start. Whether it’s tossing a handful of fresh or frozen &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-lemon-blueberry-smoothie-8363288" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blueberries into a morning smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, sprinkling &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8026653/blueberry-baked-oatmeal/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;them on oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or enjoying them as a midday snack, these little berries pack a big punch when it comes to supporting heart and gut health. Knowing that such an easy swap can offer measurable benefits, especially for older adults or those looking to manage their cholesterol or improve their gut microbiota make up, makes incorporating blueberries into daily routines a no-brainer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s particularly encouraging about this study is its emphasis on accessibility and minimal effort. Unlike drastic lifestyle overhauls or invasive health interventions, eating more blueberries is a scalable practice that can fit into nearly any diet. It’s also a great reminder that small, consistent dietary changes can yield meaningful health benefits over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights the impressive health benefits of adding blueberries to your diet, particularly for older adults aiming to support their heart and gut health. While more research is needed to fully understand the far-reaching implications, the evidence so far points to blueberries as a simple, enjoyable and fairly accessible way to improve overall well-being. Whether you’re looking to manage cholesterol levels, enhance gut microbiota, or simply enjoy a tasty snack with no added sugar, making blueberries a regular part of your diet is a step towards a healthier you.

However, the study authors noted that there is limited data on which specific individuals within this age group were more likely to receive a vaccination.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;To further understand what aids or hinders RSV vaccine acceptance, researchers conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a multicenter surveillance network, Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY), that assessed individuals hospitalized with acute respiratory illness (ARI) from 26 US hospitals in 20 states.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;A total of 6746 hospitalized individuals 60 years and older were included in the analysis, with the median age of 73 years. Demographic and clinical information was collected from patient interviews and electronic medical records. Additionally, the study authors noted individuals’ addresses were converted into geocodes to determine the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) for each individual.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;Among the 6566 individuals who reported their race and ethnicity, 10.6% were Hispanic, 19.5% were non-Hispanic Black, 65.1% were non-Hispanic White, and 4.7% identified as other race and ethnicity. Of the total study population, 10.4% (700) had received an RSV vaccine, while the vast majority, 89.6% (6046), were unvaccinated.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The results demonstrated that among the 3219 unvaccinated individuals surveyed about RSV knowledge, 47.2% (1519 individuals) had either never heard of RSV or were uncertain about it, and 78.5% (2525 out of 3218) were unsure or believed they were ineligible for the RSV vaccine. Adjusted analyses revealed that being 75 years or older (adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 1.23), male (ARR, 1.15), having pulmonary disease (ARR, 1.39) or immunocompromised status (ARR, 1.30), residing in areas with low or moderate SVI (ARR, 1.47 for both), and having more years of education were associated with a higher likelihood of RSV vaccination. However, further results revealed that RSV vaccination was less common among residents of long-term care facilities, those with Medicaid, and uninsured individuals.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-2"&gt;The findings suggest that continuing to track vaccination rates in future seasons to examine if simpler guidelines, along with increased public awareness and better access to preventative care, will result in higher vaccination rates among older adults at risk of severe RSV.&lt;sup class="text-inherit"&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REFERENCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6 class="text-sm pb-4 pt-2"&gt;1.

						&lt;p&gt;A record 484 North Carolinians have died from the flu this year, and
that number will likely rise in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The number is the highest since the state
began reporting deaths in the 2008-2009 season. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Deaths always lag several weeks behind the peaks of the
infection,” explained Dr. David Weber with UNC Health. “People start getting sick
and that’s when they measure when they test positive or come through the emergency
department, that’s the number you see peaking in mid-February. Then they take
several days or weeks to get really sick and they come to the hospital. While
we save many people, some people then go on and have a downhill course with
complications related to the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://flu.ncdhhs.gov/data.htm"&gt;North Carolina’s
flu history&lt;/a&gt; has seen many fluctuations, including overall case and death totals
and when the virus itself peaks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 2008-2009 flu season, 12 people had died
from the flu statewide. This season’s death toll is 3,933%
higher. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2024-2025 season, the highest death toll in a
single flu season was recorded in 2017-2018. 391 people died statewide that season.
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; The highest number of
pediatric deaths -- deaths of people under the age of 18 -- was recorded during last flu season, with 16 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A review
of Immunization Registry records &lt;a href="https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/flu/figures/flu2324.pdf"&gt;showed that 75% of
those children were not vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, according to
the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said the high case counts this year can largely be
attributed to fewer social distancing protocols and fewer vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Many people are not masking the way they did in previous
years during the height of the COVID pandemic,” he said. “Second, the number of
people getting flu vaccines – as with other vaccines like the measles vaccine –
has decreased.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The infectious diseases expert said a common reason people
don’t get vaccinated is based on myth. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest reason people don’t get their annual
flu shot is they don’t perceive themselves as at-risk for serious illness and
think, ‘Oh I’m 20 and can’t get severely ill,'” said Weber. “That’s not true.
People can get sick and die from flu at any age.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor shared people often “minimize the benefits of a
flu shot and over-consider the safety concerns” when it comes to their annual
vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said he often equates vaccinations to wearing a
seatbelt. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Someone will say to me ‘I don’t want to wear a seatbelt
because I read about a car that got sideswiped and fell into a lake and the
seatbelt jammed and the person drowned.’ Has that happened? Yes. But for every
person where that’s happened, there are a thousand people walking around
healthy today because a seatbelt either saved their life or saved them from
severe injury,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccinations have been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Reduce%20severity%20of%20illness&amp;amp;text=A%202021%20study%20showed%20that,with%20those%20who%20were%20unvaccinated."&gt;significantly
reduce risk of death and hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; due to serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber advised at-risk groups in particular to make a
plan to get their flu vaccine every year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Anyone with underlying disease, that puts them at risk of
severe case of flu -- heart disease, lung disease, a smoker, asthma, people with
diabetes -- I think anyone if you’re 6 months of age and breathing
should get a flu shot period,” Weber said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor emphasized the importance of flu vaccinations for
pregnant women and those aged 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“While the flu vaccine is not perfect and is usually about
50-70% effective in preventing disease, it is actually much better at
preventing death than hospitalization,” said Weber. “It may not prevent
everyone from getting ill, but it does a pretty good job of keeping you from
dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When asked about future flu seasons, Weber said increasing
education and getting more people vaccinated is key. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Each year the flu virus drifts a little bit, so each year we
make up a new flu vaccine to counter those small changes. We look at what
happens in the southern hemisphere – which is their winter, our summer – and
that’s how companies decide what to put in the vaccine drugs,” Weber explained.
“Every 5-20 years, we have a big shift; we get a new flu strain that’s totally
different, and we get a pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber continued, “I can’t predict when there will be the
next flu pandemic, I can only tell you there will be a flu pandemic. It’s only
a matter of time based on what’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor theorized H5N1 could have the potential to cause
serious sickness in humans, if the virus mutates further. Since 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html#:~:text=Since%20April%202024%2C%2070%20human,H5N1)%20virus%2Dinfected%20poultry."&gt;70
human cases of bird flu have been reported in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“So far that particular strain of flu has not picked up the
characteristics that allow it go person-to-person, but that’s a big concern
that we could at any point – even this summer – have a pandemic that’s H5N1 for
which none of us have any immunity,” said Weber. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor said if the H5N1 virus does begin to jump from
human-to-human, a large spike in cases and bird-flu deaths would likely occur. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If it doesn’t happen this summer, it’s only a matter of
time before we see another flu pandemic,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;To be prepared, Weber said North Carolinians need be
willing to make vaccinations more of a priority moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We need to support the companies to make the best flu
vaccine with the most current strains, and we need to take the vaccine, which
most people do not,” he said. “Separate from that, we need to support our
public health colleagues. Federal, state and local governments need to be
prepared for yet another pandemic. I know we all have pandemic fatigue, and we
don’t want to think about another one, but much like hurricanes, we’re going to
have them and we need to be prepared as a society for how to deal with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said that anyone with flu-like symptoms -- a high fever, dry cough, sore throat, body aches or runny nose -- should take an at-home test or be tested in a

&lt;p&gt;A commercial poultry flock in Sheboygan County will be depopulated, with none of the birds entering the food system.  That announcement came this Friday afternoon from the Wisconsin Department of Ag, Trade and Consumer Protection as it announced the discovery of a case of the highly pathogenic avian influenza within that flock which, according to DATCP records, numbers around 40,000 birds.  With that announcement also comes the word that there are no apparent risks to human health from domestic poultry or their products at this time.  But for producers and owners of poultry, the impact is immediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus, known as HPAI H5N1, is the same that has been impacting the price of eggs nationwide as it spreads from an infected wild bird or their droppings to flocks, or is even transferred from the clothing of workers who’ve contacted the virus by handling infected animals.  When HPAI H5N1 is diagnosed in a Wisconsin poultry flock, a control area is established within a 10 kilometer area around the infected premises, restricting movement on or off any premises with poultry.  The quarantine will remain in effect until released by the State Veterinarian.  Until then, all poultry producers in the Control Area must comply with stringent biosecurity and permitting protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounding the Control Area 10 kilometer perimeter, out to 20 kilometers is a Surveillance Zone.  Within that, all registered poultry premises will receive a survey from the Division of Animal Health at DATCP.  Poultry within the Surveillance Zone is not under quarantine, but it is strongly advised to restrict movement only to that necessary, as the virus is likely circulating in the wild population.  Because of that, all within the Surveillance Zone should monitor their flocks for any changes in behavior or health of the birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For updates on how the virus is affecting domestic birds in Wisconsin, and to find resources on protecting Wisconsin poultry, visit DATCP’s &lt;a href="https://datcp.wi.gov/Pages/Programs_Services/HPAIWisconsin.aspx"&gt;HPAI in Poultry&lt;/a&gt; webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The CDC said 2 more jurisdictions reported cases this week, raising the total to 22—21 states and New York City. One more outbreak was reported, making six so far, and 93% of cases confirmed so far are part of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the total patients, 97% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination statuses, and 74 (12%) have been hospitalized. The nation is on track to pass the 1,274 cases reported in 2019, a year when a surge of measles activity threatened the nation's measles elimination status, which it earned in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Texas total climbs to 481 cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 59 more cases, pushing the state's total since January to 481 in 19 counties. Fourteen more people were hospitalized for their infections, bringing that total to 56.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the state's total, 471 patients were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most cases are reported in Gaines County on the border with New Mexico, a few linked to the outbreak have been reported in counties in central Texas, including Brown and Erath counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new development, the Harris County Public Health (HCPH), home to Houston in the southeastern part of the state, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.harriscountytx.gov/Portals/hcph/Documents/Press_Releases/Measles_April2025.pdf?ver=JvpqCq8fZ7JL_3XlZjqBoQ%3d%3d"&gt;said it is investigating&lt;/a&gt; a confirmed measles case in a child who lives in the northwestern part of the county and has no travel history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HCPH said the case was confirmed by a commercial lab and awaits secondary confirmation by the TDSHS. So far, it's not clear if the case is linked to the outbreak in west Texas. The case marks Harris County's first since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDH) &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; six more cases, raising the state's total to 54. The New Mexico outbreak is limited to two counties—Lea and Eddy— that border the Texas outbreak hot spot. Among the 54 patients, 48 were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma, another state with cases linked to the Texas outbreak, reported no new cases today, keeping its total at 10, which includes 8 confirmed and 2 probable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cases rise in Tennessee&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks are occurring in other states, though it’s not clear if all are linked to the Texas event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) &lt;a href="https://www.tn.gov/health/news/2025/4/1/tennessee-department-of-health-confirms-three-additional-measles-cases.html"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt; that three more cases have been confirmed in middle Tennessee, bringing the state's total to four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the newly confirmed cases is linked to the first Tennessee case, which was confirmed on March 21, and the exposure source is unknown. The TDH added that no other details are available about the other cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A supposed cure for measles is harming people in Texas. A children’s hospital in the area has reported that several children treated for measles have also developed vitamin A toxicity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on the phenomenon last week, and has since backed by further reports from &lt;a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/west-texas-measles-outbreak-children-treated-vitamin-a-medical-disinformation/"&gt;local media outlets&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, one of several counties in West Texas currently affected by measles, stated that it has treated fewer than 10 children with concurrent measles and vitamin A toxicity. Robert F. Kennedy, the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has touted vitamin A as a measles treatment, despite little rationale for its use in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several related outbreaks of measles ongoing in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/measles-kansas-multistate-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, now totaling over 500 reported cases since January (the actual toll is likely higher). These outbreaks have largely been concentrated among pockets of unvaccinated people, and vaccination remains the most effective measure to contain the spread of this highly contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr., a longtime and regularly debunked vaccine skeptic, has tepidly supported the use of vaccination during these outbreaks, but not without bringing up other worthless interventions. In early March, during a lengthy Fox News interview, Kennedy claimed that cod liver oil pills (rich in vitamin A), steroids, and antibiotics could be useful treatments for measles, for instance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research has shown that measles can be severe in children with vitamin A deficiency, and the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20(WHO)%20recommends%20a%20daily%20oral%20dose%20of%20vitamin%20A%20for%20two%20days%20to%20children%20with%20measles%20living%20in%20areas%20where%20vitamin%20A%20deficiency%20may%20be%20present."&gt;does recommend&lt;/a&gt; that doctors provide vitamin A to measles-infected children in regions where deficiency is common.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But this deficiency is incredibly rare in the U.S. (perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK567744/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%20(US,and%20low%20absorption.%5B17%5D"&gt;around 0.3%&lt;/a&gt; of the general population), and there is no evidence that cod liver oil itself can be beneficial for measles. The high doses sometimes used to treat measles could also cause toxicity if given carelessly, which seems to be exactly what’s happening with these cases. Too much vitamin A can cause &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532916/#:~:text=Prolonged%20and%20excessive%20vitamin%20A%20intake%20can%20result%20in%20significant%20organ%20damage%2C%20including%20the%20liver%2C%20bones%2C%20central%20nervous%20system%2C%20and%20skin.%20Liver%C2%A0fibrosis%20or%20cirrhosis%20may%20be%20irreversible."&gt;significant, even irreversible&lt;/a&gt; organ damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;over 600 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. as of early April, including isolated, travel-related cases in 17 other states; 97% have involved people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. 74 people, mostly children, have been hospitalized. At least one person &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-outbreak-in-texas-turns-deadly-as-parents-scramble-for-shots-2000568730"&gt;has died&lt;/a&gt; as a result, while officials in New Mexico are investigating a &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188"&gt;second death&lt;/a&gt; that may have been connected to measles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cases and deaths were entirely preventable, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/do-you-need-a-measles-booster-shot-the-answer-may-surprise-you-2000584301"&gt;highly effective and long-lasting vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. RFK’s support of vitamin A as a measles treatment is both wrongheaded and actively harming children with little choice in the matter. Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock has called for people to avoid excessive vitamin A use, given the potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

I discovered this when I looked through his social media posts online and saw some of the pics and messages he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

Something like that has no place in a house where children live, and I told him as much when I confronted him. I was shocked by his response.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s not good enough. I said that I wanted all of the paraphernalia out of the house. Jason told me I didn’t get to dictate what he and his wife do in private.

I realize that your ex’s proclivities may be shocking to you, but he and his wife aren’t doing anything wrong. They are two people in a committed relationship having an active sex life, much like other parents all over the world. The sex room and social media sharing may not be as common, but as long as they have committed to keeping their exploits away from their children, they aren’t violating any rules. There are many moms and dads who screw each other’s brains out on the family couch when the kids are away; these two have taken steps to create a child-free zone dedicated to lovemaking.&lt;br&gt;Please cease your attack on your ex’s way of life; he’s not putting his children in harm’s way. When your daughter comes back to you, talk to her about her time with her dad and his family; if anything ever seems amiss, then raise your concerns. But for now, you honestly shouldn’t have any. This couple’s sex life is none of your business so long as they keep it away from your child, and it sounds like they are. Please don’t bother some overworked CPS employee with something like this when there are children in actual danger that they need to worry about. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;—Jamilah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say the infected person was not out in public during the infectious period, so there is no known public exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious disease and spreads through the air when a person coughs, sneezes or talks,” said director/health officer of Macomb County Health and Community Services Andrew Cox in a news release. “If you are not vaccinated for measles, get vaccinated as quickly as you can. It is important to make sure you protect yourself and loved ones from this vaccine-preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Macomb County Health Department also issued the following information on measles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;Ninety percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles will become infected. Infected individuals can spread measles before noticing symptoms, including four days before the rash appears. Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104˚F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;If symptoms develop, call your doctor, urgent care, or hospital before seeking treatment so steps can be taken to prevent exposure to other individuals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cases are increasing across the U.S. and outbreaks are occurring nationally and globally. As of March 27, 2025, a total of 483 measles cases have been reported by 19 states (including Michigan).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The measles vaccine is highly effective, very safe and provides long-lasting protection. A single dose of measles vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses are about 97% effective. It is also effective if used within 72 hours of measles exposure to prevent illness. Anyone not fully vaccinated against measles is encouraged to do so as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaccination is available from healthcare providers, pharmacies, and the Macomb County Health Department. Children eligible for the Vaccines for Children program may receive the vaccine from a provider enrolled in that program at no cost.

&lt;p&gt;Northwestern University engineers have developed a pacemaker so small that it can fit inside the tip of a syringe and be non-invasively injected into the body, according to a new study published in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it can work with hearts of all sizes, the pacemaker is particularly well-suited to the tiny, fragile hearts of newborn babies with congenital heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pacemaker is an implantable device that helps maintain an even heart rate, either because the heart’s natural cardiac pacemaker provides an inadequate or irregular heartbeat, or because there is a block in the heart’s electrical conduction system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller than a single grain of rice, the pacemaker is paired with a small, soft, flexible, wireless, wearable device that mounts onto a patient’s chest to control pacing. When the wearable device detects an irregular heartbeat, it automatically shines a light to activate the pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These short light pulses, which penetrate through the patient’s skin, breastbone, and muscles, control the pacing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for patients who only need temporary pacing, the pacemaker simply dissolves after it’s no longer needed. All the pacemaker’s components are biocompatible, so they naturally dissolve into the body’s biofluids, bypassing the need for surgical extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper demonstrates the device’s efficacy across a series of large and small animal models as well as human hearts from deceased organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” said John A. Rogers, PhD, professor of Neurological Surgery, Dermatology, and in the McCormick School of Engineering, who led the device development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body—the smaller, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our major motivation was children,” &lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2025/04/02/worlds-smallest-pacemaker-is-activated-by-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Igor Efimov, PhD, professor of Medicine in the Division of Cardiology and in the McCormick School of Engineering, who co-led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects, regardless of whether they live in a low-resource or high-resource country. The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a surgery. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical. Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device. And no additional surgery is necessary to remove it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work builds on a previous collaboration between Rogers and Efimov, in which they developed the first dissolvable device for temporary pacing. Many patients require temporary pacemakers after heart surgery — either while waiting for a permanent pacemaker or to help restore a normal heart rate during recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the current standard of care, surgeons sew the electrodes onto the heart muscle during surgery. Wires from the electrodes exit the front of a patient’s chest, where they connect to an external pacing box that delivers a current to control the heart’s rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the temporary pacemaker is no longer needed, physicians remove the pacemaker electrodes. Potential complications include infection, dislodgement, torn or damaged tissues, bleeding, and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died,” Efimov said. He had a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery. When the wires were removed, he experienced internal bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADVANCES TO GET YOU EXCITED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Tiny Implantable Sensors Helped Broken Bones Heal in Weeks Rather Than Months" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/these-tiny-implantable-sensors-helped-broken-bones-heal-in-weeks-rather-than-months/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Tiny Implantable Sensors Helped Broken Bones Heal in Weeks Rather Than Months&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to this clinical need, Rogers, Efimov, and their teams developed their first dissolvable pacemaker, which was introduced in Nature Biotechnology in 2021. The thin, flexible, lightweight device eliminated the need for bulky batteries and rigid hardware, including wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help further reduce the device’s size, the researchers also reimagined its power source. Instead of using near-field communication to supply power, the new, tiny pacemaker operates through the action of a galvanic cell, a type of simple battery that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. Specifically, the pacemaker uses two different metals as electrodes to deliver electrical pulses to the heart. When in contact with surrounding biofluids, the electrodes form a battery. The resulting chemical reactions cause the electrical current to flow to stimulate the heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the pacemaker is implanted into the body, the surrounding biofluids act as the conducting electrolyte that electrically joins those two metal pads to form the battery,” Rogers said. “A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIODEGRADABLE IMPLANTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Dissolvable Implant Relieves Pain On Demand Without the Use of Drugs or Opioids" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/northwestern-u-dissolvable-implant-cuts-pain-without-drugs/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Dissolvable Implant Relieves Pain On Demand Without the Use of Drugs or Opioids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used an infrared wavelength of light that penetrates deeply and safely into the body. If the patient’s heart rate drops below a certain rate, the wearable device detects the event and automatically activates a light-emitting diode. The light then flashes on and off at a rate that corresponds to the normal heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” Efimov said. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand. It turns out that our bodies are great conductors of light.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the pacemaker is so tiny—measuring just 1.8 millimeters in width, 3.5 millimeters in length and 1 millimeter in thickness—it still delivers as much stimulation as a full-sized pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The heart requires a tiny amount of electrical stimulation,” Rogers said. “By minimizing the size, we dramatically simplify the implantation procedures, we reduce trauma and risk to the patient, and, with the dissolvable nature of the device, we eliminate any need for secondary surgical extraction procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from The University of Manchester may reshape our understanding of what happens to the immune system when we fast. The study on mice shows that the brain's hypothalamus controls how the immune system adapts during fasting, through a handful of highly specialized neurons responsible for making animals hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;i&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adr3226" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; shows the brain's perception of hunger or fullness, rather than actual eating or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/caloric+restriction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;caloric restriction&lt;/a&gt;, is enough to drive changes in the body's immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings cast doubt on the current view that a lack of nutrients alone controls how the immune system responds to fasting, indicating the brain has a critical role, beyond the simple absence of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By artificially switching on specific brain neurons in mice—which typically signal low energy levels—scientists induced a synthetic sense of hunger. Remarkably, within hours, they saw a fast reorganization of immune cells in the blood, with a noticeable drop in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+monocytes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory monocytes&lt;/a&gt;. These artificially hungry mice looked, from an immune perspective, just like mice that had fasted for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery could have important implications for developing new therapies to treat a range of inflammatory diseases as well as for treating wasting syndromes seen in cancer, in which individuals lose weight despite eating normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also explain why obesity often accompanies inflammatory conditions and why malnourished individuals are more prone to infections and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The lead senior researcher, Dr. Giuseppe D'Agostino, who coordinated the study, said, "Our perceptions can shape our bodies in ways we don't always notice. It's easy to see how thoughts guide our actions, but this study reminds us that even our internal body adjustments that are not under conscious control respond to the brain's signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study underlines how important the brain is in regulating the immune system. But if internal or external factors alter the brain's perception, these processes can go awry, reminding us how deeply the mind and body are—and should remain—connected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborator and Manchester immunologist Professor Matt Hepworth added, "This work challenges the long-standing view that fasting's immunological impact is driven purely by nutrient levels. It highlights the nervous system's profound influence on how the immune system adapts during fasting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr. Cavalcanti de Albuquerque said, "By showing how the brain exerts top-down control over &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;, we can further explore when and how fasting might deliver health benefits. It also opens up potential ways to treat infectious, inflammatory, metabolic, and psychiatric conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

But actually finding pockets of time to sweat all throughout the week can be tricky, especially if you have a demanding day job and/or a hectic personal and family life. But, get this: Only exercising on the weekends or a couple of days a week may be as healthy as spreading physical activity out throughout the week, depending on your activity level, new research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study was not perfect, it has raised plenty of questions about how much you really need to care about your exercise frequency and regularity. Here’s what researchers found—plus why doctors still recommend spreading out your workouts, if and when you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at the Orange Coast Medical Center. &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/bert-mandelbaum-819188.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bert Mandelbaum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bert Mandelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/jason-womack__;!!Ivohdkk!iMisgUKIoV09PW_VwMgQagrzAONwMouVZU3wC5WOGhcp4vB6LYLIi9bzTxBTeeXbClOvIZiJ1CV29Gp2BnPD7SRwy9McPQ$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason P.

The researchers organized participants into three groups based on their activity level:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active weekend warriors: &lt;/strong&gt;People who get enough moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to meet health guidelines (150+ minutes per week), but at least 50 percent of their activity happens on just one or two days per week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active regulars&lt;/strong&gt;: People who also hit the moderate-to-vigorous exercise criteria, but who spread it out more evenly across at least three days each week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactive&lt;/strong&gt;: People who didn’t meet the recommended 150+ minutes of exercise a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that both the active regular and weekend warrior groups had a lower risk of death from all causes (up to 32 percent), as well as a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and cancer. “Engaging in physical activity concentrated within one to two days was related with a similar reduction in mortality risk as more evenly spread activity,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, you shouldn’t sweat it if all you can manage is to crank out your workouts on weekends—it's still better for your health than being less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, if you're looking at people who are exercising at all, there is going to be some health benefit compared to people who are not working out as much," says Jason P. Womack, MD, chief of the Division of Sports Medicine and associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can weekend warriors earn the same health perks as more consistent exercisers, you ask?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, the study results suggest that getting in the recommended weekly amount of exercise is beneficial for your health—especially when you’re looking at risk for conditions like heart disease and cancer risk, says Bert Mandelbaum, MD, sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This [research] really shows that some exercise is good, more exercise is better, and most exercise is best,” he says. Being able to get your heart rate up for a certain period of time will always be helpful for your overall health, no matter when you can squeeze it in, Dr. Mandelbaum notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Berg, MD, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, agrees. “Exercise is medicine, and its impact on overall health—particularly heart health—cannot be overstated,” he says. That's true whether you spread it out or jam it in over a few days, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what should women take away from this finding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can only work out on the weekends, you can continue to do just that without stressing that you’re somehow screwing up your health. But the doctors we spoke with still aren’t convinced that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; being a weekend warrior is the move if you do have the choice to spread out more exercise out during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for this. One is that the researchers in this study only looked at seven days of physical activity data to determine what kind of exercise routine people had in place. So, someone who looked to be a so-called weekend warrior on that particular week may have actually been a more regular exerciser on other weeks—possibly skewing the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a strength program that fits into a busy schedule?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-single.html?cds_tracking_code=whl_edit_inline_weekend_warrior_study_a64388450" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for WH+;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sign up for WH+&lt;/a&gt; for exclusive follow-along programs that work for every lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is that there are certain health metrics, such as &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VO2 max;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, that the study didn’t look at. (VO2 max measures how much oxygen you can use during intense exercise, and it’s considered a good indicator of fitness.) For example, “you can impact your VO2 max favorably by pushing workouts to the weekend, but you’ll have an even better VO2 max if you work out more consistently,” Dr. Mandelbaum explains. The study also didn't look at factors such as organ health or longevity, Dr. Mandelbaum points out—it only looked at mortality rates from specific causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing to consider: Being a weekend warrior can also raise your risk of injury, especially if you’re starting from a lower level of fitness, Dr. Berg says. (If you only exercise once or twice a week, your body may not get accustomed to regular movement and muscle engagement, which can set you up for injury or not allow for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30626595/active-recovery/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:proper recovery;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;proper recovery&lt;/a&gt; between intense sessions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, if working out on the weekends, or only a couple days in general during the week, is all you can manage, then great. But Dr. Mandelbaum recommends trying to do what you can to incorporate more pockets of movement into your schedule where you can. “Wake up a little earlier, and be more creative about when you can exercise,” he says. “The best bet for your health and fitness is to put exercise in some form into your day, every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 17:57:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE1uUlVOcmZUTC1SSm4xU0hORkZLT3BybmRBeE1WQlBDUUtsWG9LOG1TTHZSOWd2MmxDd0R1SWJaYWtGMUN2RVc2VG9KV1JQV2w1NnEzbDJNdVBXVkh5UmpBZ1hFc0l3azFGZnBObHg3SDVLOGVFN2E0a2x3</guid></item></channel></rss>
