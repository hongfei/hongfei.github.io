Despite this, the US is dismantling many of its vaccine recommendations. Flu vaccine recommendations for children &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/05/trump-rfk-jr-child-vaccine-recommendations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; in early January to “shared clinical decision-making”, which has typically meant a provider recommends the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When asked whether the new restrictions would lead to fewer children getting vaccinated against the flu, “maybe that’s a better thing”, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services and a longtime vaccine critic, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-says-it-may-be-better-if-fewer-children-receive-the-flu-vaccine/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CBS News last week. “There is no scientific evidence that the flu vaccine prevents serious illness, hospitalizations or death in children,” Kennedy claimed, despite extensive studies, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/risk-groups/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), showing the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072184/206063/Influenza-Vaccine-Effectiveness-Among-Children?redirectedFrom=fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10979318/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828501" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His comments come after Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services, cast doubt on how well flu vaccines work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every year, there’s a flu vaccine. It doesn’t always work very well. That’s why it’s been controversial of late,” Oz &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=738968345466786" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on Newsmax. He instead recommended that Americans “take care” of themselves, so they can “overwhelm” the flu when they encounter it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CDC press statements have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5661508/flu-cdc-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one”, urging people to consult with their doctors to understand “the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines”. Unlike in previous years, there have been no health advisory notices from the CDC on the new variant, top health officials haven’t publicly received vaccines and a successful campaign called “Wild to Mild” was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/11/pediatricians-vaccines-flu-season" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;halted and not resumed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The dominant flu strain in the US is H3N2, which tends to cause more severe illness, and this particular variant, subclade K, has mutated to get around immune defenses, which means more people may be susceptible to the flu than usual. The last time H3N2 spread through the US, in &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm#:~:text=Influenza%20(Flu)-,Estimated%20Flu%2DRelated%20Illnesses%2C%20Medical%20Visits%2C%20Hospitalizations%2C%20and,On%20This%20Page" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2017-18&lt;/a&gt;, about 51,000 people died, making it the most severe flu season in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So far this year, there have been about 15m illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations and 7,400 deaths from the flu, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; in its weekly update on 9 January – with deaths including at least 17 children . “There is still time to get vaccinated against flu this season,” the CDC concluded in the report, in sharp relief to public statements by health officials and new restrictions on the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an earlier CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, about 8.2% of visits to the doctor were for flu-like respiratory illnesses – the highest rate for this point in the season since the 1997-98 season. That rate fell slightly to 7.2% last week, but the CDC cautioned that the drop could be due to delays in reporting or seeking care because of the holidays. Some health systems are requiring providers to wear face masks amid &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/flu-season-ramps-nationwide-record-high-outpatient-illnesses-increasing-hospitalizations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;surging cases&lt;/a&gt;. New York, for instance, logged the most hospitalizations it has ever seen in the week ending 27 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The flu can be extremely, extremely severe. It can be really scary,” said Megan Berman, professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch, and faculty with the Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Berman has seen an influx of patients who need to be hospitalized, and “what they all had in common is actually they had not been vaccinated”. Even patients who have already gotten cases of flu A would still benefit from vaccines, she said, because there was often a double peak in flu season with flu B, which the vaccine also protects against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Early &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pre-print-early-influenza-virus-characterisation-and-vaccine-effectiveness-in-england-in-autumn-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the UK, where flu season started early and now seems to be abating, shows that the vaccine is still effective at preventing hospitalizations: 70-75% effective in children and 30-40% effective in adults, a rate similar to previous flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the flu shot may not stop transmission, it is still very effective at preventing severe illness, Lakdawala said. But only 42.5% of children and 43.5% of adults have received the shot this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC. Vaccination rates have fallen in recent years after reaching a high of 63.7% of children and 48.4% of adults in 2019-20 – &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/vaccination-2019-2020.html#:~:text=Vaccination%20coverage%20with%20%E2%89%A51,in%20flu%20vaccination%20coverage%20persisted." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt; of the US population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Covid rates are also high, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is increasing, putting more pressure on hospitals. Both of those childhood shots also saw &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/11/rsv-vaccines-trump-kennedy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent restrictions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The changes in the recommendations will probably further dampen vaccination rates because it “gives the message that it’s not important”, Berman said. Yet “nothing has changed from the science, and I know that physicians are still strongly recommending it to everyone six months and older … &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/children" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt; should not be dying from a preventable illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Antiviral treatments for flu have also fallen in recent years. About 79% of hospitalized flu patients in 2022-23 received antivirals, compared with 90% in 2018-19. The drop was especially pronounced in children; three out of five children hospitalized for the flu in 2022-23 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/ss/pdfs/ss7306a1-H.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; the medications, compared with four out of five in 2018-19. Only 28% of children under age five who are sick enough with the flu to see a doctor are prescribed antivirals, and only 32% of children who seek care for flu in emergency departments receive the treatments, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coca/hcp/trainings/seasonal_influenza_2025-2026.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the same time, mortality among children is rising, with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/18/cdc-flu-vaccination" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nearly 300 children&lt;/a&gt; dying from the flu last season – the most deaths from the flu outside of a pandemic since the CDC started keeping track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="18f8319e-fa91-45ca-90e5-8cd07a6ecdc9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":17,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Health secretary RFK Jr appoints two vaccine skeptics to CDC advisory panel","elementId":"18f8319e-fa91-45ca-90e5-8cd07a6ecdc9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a patient is sick enough to seek care from a doctor, they should receive antivirals, Berman said, and so should patients with underlying medical conditions, pregnant people and older people. There are four antiviral medications for the flu, and they all work well against this variant. It’s best to start them as soon as possible after testing positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s also a risk, as H5N1 bird flu continues to devastate flocks across the US, of two flu variants &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/02/bird-flu-vaccine" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;mixing to create&lt;/a&gt; another, deadlier variant, a process called reassortment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What I worry about most with bird flu is, in five years, it will have reassorted to something else,” Lakdawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are effective ways to control the spread of the flu, Lakdawala said, noting “we have every tool in our arsenal” and “we should use them when anyone’s sick”. In addition to getting vaccinated and taking antivirals, people can wear face masks, improve ventilation, wash hands, cover coughs and sneezes and stay home when they are sick to keep the flu in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We learned something really important about flu transmission during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that is that we can control it. We actually have the capacity to control flu disease burden,” Lakdawala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Berman noted that “people are not helpless”, adding: “We can do something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQMzRrdTRROG5XVm4yTzd1dW9ocEhGOEpOQTczSVJMbUx6M2xrdUs5WF9sQ29hZjdhNjI5TU0waGJOLXZvM1VsRWNkZWU0dVZLT1hZM0ltc2pKMTFidXVFNmpFWnUtMnI0d0RsSzBTdmJzX0MzMWdVMWpkYS1IbTBfc0xrOTBGWnZZRjE3ajBwNzFNdw</guid></item><item><title>女性在没有极端饮食的情况下在18个月内减掉了45公斤：以下是帮助她减肥的5个“愚蠢”习惯|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/woman-lost-45-kg-in-18-months-without-extreme-diets-here-are-5-dumb-habits-that-helped-her-lose-weight-fat-loss-101768565245531.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;Losing weight is often seen as a battle of strict diets and gruelling workouts, but sustainable results usually come from small, consistent &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/lifestyle" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="lifestyle"&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; changes. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Hayleigh, who lost 45 kg in just 18 months, shared her journey in a January 14 Instagram post, revealing 5 habits she once considered “dumb” that were secretly holding her back, and how ditching them made all the difference.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Also read: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/apollo-neurologist-shares-how-22-year-old-s-mysterious-symptoms-were-actually-caused-by-thiamine-deficiency-101768552489174.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Apollo neurologist shares how 22-year-old’s ‘mysterious' symptoms were actually caused by a dangerous vitamin deficiency"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apollo neurologist shares how 22-year-old’s ‘mysterious' symptoms were actually caused by a dangerous vitamin deficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; )&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="artImage leadImage"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=""&gt;Check out Hayleigh's 5 simple habits for sustainable weight loss and better health. (Instagram/@hayleigh_fit)&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Walk your way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayleigh calls walking “the most underrated form of exercise” and swears by it. She recommends 30–45 minutes of &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/walking" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="walking"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;, ideally outdoors, for fresh air, movement, and a mental reset. To make it more effective and enjoyable, she suggests adding a weighted vest or tuning into a favourite podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Drink enough water&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking enough water was a game-changer for her. Hayleigh aims for about half her body weight in ounces each day, for example, someone weighing 200 pounds would target roughly 100 ounces. Staying hydrated helped curb cravings and boost energy, and she also adds electrolytes once a day for an extra lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Eat protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein played a key role in keeping her full and supporting &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fitness-trainer-warns-excess-protein-may-cause-weight-gain-protein-only-helps-fat-loss-when-101768528672488.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fat loss"&gt;fat loss&lt;/a&gt;. She targets at least 100 grams a day, which helps manage hunger and build muscle, essential for burning fat. As she puts it, the approach is simple, not complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Start mornings intentionally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting the day with purpose was one of her most impactful habits. This could include working out, meditating, or simply being present. Her rule: no phone for the first 30 minutes. She suggests trying this for two weeks to notice reduced &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/stress" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="stress"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, better sleep, improved focus, and enhanced mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Include fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre rounds out her essentials. Hayleigh follows a simple rule: include three servings of vegetables a day. Fibre aids digestion, keeps you full, and helps process carbs more easily, what she calls a way to “keep the scale scaries away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;A massive study of more than 18,000 people has revealed that "&lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2025/08/12/what-makes-a-superager/"&gt;SuperAgers&lt;/a&gt;" – people unusually resistant to dementia in older age – have at least two key genetic advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only is this population of adults aged 80+ much less likely to carry &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;a gene variant that's associated with higher Alzheimer's risk&lt;/a&gt;, but they're also more likely to carry one associated with lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a result that shows that, while genes are far from the only factor at play, exceptional memory in old age is at least partly written into the superager genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was our most striking finding," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112882"&gt;says neuropsychologist Leslie Gaynor&lt;/a&gt; of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although all adults who reach the age of 80 without receiving a diagnosis of clinical dementia exhibit exceptional aging, our study suggests that the superager phenotype can be used to identify a particularly exceptional group of oldest-old adults with a reduced genetic risk for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="189217" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-reveals-crucial-differences"&gt;Blood of Exceptionally Long-Lived People Reveals Crucial Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superagers are a population whose memories can best be described as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.6034"&gt;exceptional among their demographic&lt;/a&gt;, rivalling those of people &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610224000024"&gt;decades younger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't just manifest as cognitive sharpness. Superagers also appear far less likely to develop dementia than the general population. Scientists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.0627"&gt;would like to know&lt;/a&gt; how this occurs, because it may offer insights into some of the mechanisms behind dementia, as well as possible strategies for delay and mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With interest in superagers growing," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112882"&gt;Gaynor says&lt;/a&gt;, "our findings notably encourage the view that the superager phenotype will prove useful in the continued search for mechanisms conferring resilience to Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-genetic-form-of-alzheimers-identified-in-people-with-common-risk-factor"&gt;It's well established&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;span&gt;ε4 &lt;/span&gt;variant of the gene Apolipoprotein E (&lt;i&gt;APOE)&lt;/i&gt; is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsb.2021.10.002"&gt;strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, a neurodegenerative condition with no known cure, characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive function, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-sad-case-of-the-youngest-person-ever-to-be-diagnosed-with-alzheimers"&gt;usually in old age&lt;/a&gt;. On the other hand, the gene variant &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-ε2 is associated with a much &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-rare-gene-variant-seems-to-protect-you-from-alzheimers-disease"&gt;lower risk of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging studies have shown differences in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superagers-with-incredible-memories-have-brains-like-25-year-olds"&gt;brain structure&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;resistance to the amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt; associated with Alzheimer's between SuperAgers and the rest of the population. Gaynor, her co-lead author, statistical genetic analyst Alaina Durant of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and their colleagues wanted to study what role, if any, genetics plays in superager status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research was based on an analysis of data collected from 18,080 people across eight large aging studies conducted in the US. These studies included tests of cognitive performance across the memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial domains, as well as genetic data collected from the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study defined superagers as those aged 80 and older whose cognitive performance exceeded the average score of cognitively normal participants aged 50–64. In total, the participants included 1,623 superagers, 8,829 people with Alzheimer's disease, and 7,628 cognitively normal controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among non-Hispanic White people, who made up the majority of study participants, the results indicated that superagers were 68 percent less likely to carry APOE-ε4 than participants with Alzheimer's disease. Crucially, they were 19 percent less likely to carry APOE-ε4 than age-matched cognitively normal controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, non-Hispanic White (NHW) superagers were 103 percent more likely to carry the protective APOE-ε2 allele than NHW participants with Alzheimer's disease, and 28 percent more likely than NHW cognitively normal controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small sample of non-Hispanic Black people in this study showed similar patterns, but the researchers acknowledge that we need more studies with a larger group of non-Hispanic Black superagers to properly determine if resilience factors vary by population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings imply that in some populations, superagers don't avoid Alzheimer's by chance; they're genetically different even from other people who age well, with their genomes tilting the odds against Alzheimer's in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is by far the largest study to date to identify differences in &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-ε4 allele frequency based on superager status, and the first study to find a relationship between &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;-ε2 allele frequency and superager status," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112882"&gt;Gaynor says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would expect these findings to lend continued interest to questions of how these variants may influence development of clinical dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the superager phenotype more generally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;i&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners were supposed to make sugary foods and beverages healthier, but today, some of the most popular zero-calorie substitutes are raising &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/even-low-doses-of-aspartame-could-have-alarming-health-effects-study-finds"&gt;new concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An up-and-coming natural alternative could one day be produced on a much grander scale, using enzymes from slime mold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural sugar is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagatose"&gt;tagatose&lt;/a&gt;, and not only does it taste 92 percent as sweet as sucrose (or table sugar), but it also packs only around a third of the calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's particularly exciting about it is that it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8718053"&gt;does not spike insulin levels&lt;/a&gt; like sucrose or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_329_19"&gt;high-intensity artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; – making it a potentially attractive option for those with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="189055" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or blood glucose issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/even-low-doses-of-aspartame-could-have-alarming-health-effects-study-finds"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Even Low Doses of Aspartame Could Have Alarming Health Effects, Study Finds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Tufts University, &lt;span&gt;in partnership with biotechnology companies Manus Bio (US) and Kcat Enzymatic (India),&lt;/span&gt; have now led a proof-of-principle study to show that tagatose can be produced sustainably and efficiently – a challenge that has so far &lt;a href="https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/tagatose-market-22465"&gt;held the market back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tagatose is a rare natural sweetener, found in only small amounts in some dairy products and fruits. It offers a potentially healthier option to sucrose as well as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, which can both drive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-key-way-of-consuming-sugar-could-spike-your-diabetes-risk"&gt;strong spikes in insulin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key reason that tagatose doesn't have the same effect is that much of it appears to be fermented in the large intestine. It's only partially absorbed into the bloodstream via the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189125" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/SweetenerStudy.jpg" alt="Sweetener Study" class="wp-image-189125 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/SweetenerStudy.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/SweetenerStudy-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189125" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Previous studies have linked the artificial sweetener aspartame to heart disease.

Unlike sucrose, which feeds certain bacteria in the mouth that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microbiologists-explain-what-happens-in-your-mouth-when-you-eat-sugar"&gt;contribute to tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;, initial research suggests that tagatose limits the growth of harmful oral microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big perk is that tagatose can be baked into foods, unlike many other high-intensity sweetener substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential is there, but so far, the tagatose market has been &lt;a href="https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/tagatose-market-22465"&gt;constrained by limited production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are established processes to produce tagatose, but they are inefficient and expensive," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/12/11/researchers-develop-way-make-healthier-sugar-substitute"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; biological engineer Nik Nair from Tufts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We developed a way to produce tagatose by engineering the bacteria &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to work as tiny factories, loaded with the right enzymes to process abundant amounts of glucose into tagatose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, researchers inserted into these bacteria a newly discovered enzyme from slime mold, called galactose-1-phosphate-selective phosphatase (Gal1P). This enzyme converts glucose into galactose, and that product is then turned into tagatose by a second enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this novel sequence, Nair and colleagues have shown that production yields for tagatose can reach up to 95 percent, which is much better than the roughly 40 to 77 percent currently achievable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key innovation in the biosynthesis of tagatose was in finding the slime mold Gal1P enzyme and splicing it into our production bacteria," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/12/11/researchers-develop-way-make-healthier-sugar-substitute"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That allowed us to reverse a natural biological pathway that metabolizes galactose to glucose and instead generate galactose from glucose supplied as a feedstock. Tagatose and potentially other rare sugars can be synthesized from that point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team still needs to further optimize their tagatose production line, but they hope their strategy provides a useful framework for future rare-sugar production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/tagatose-market-22465"&gt;some estimates&lt;/a&gt;, the tagatose market is expected to reach a value of US$250 million by 2032.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2025.102993"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Physical Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Ellie Rudd will be buried in a light blue and white Princess Elsa costume, made for her as a last gift from her aunt. “Frozen” was one of her favorite movies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00063b6szzrgva93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rambunctious 4-year-old – who loved mud and getting dressed up and having dance parties with her brother and sisters – died January 6, after the flu and a co-infection with an adenovirus turned into pneumonia and sepsis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00073b6sqes7ey2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She was probably my healthiest of all my kids,” said her mom, Sarah Rudd.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00083b6s80q0gt6q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She had no medical issues. No eczema, no cavities in her teeth, nothing.  She was completely healthy,” she said. “I have no idea why it hit her so hard.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00093b6syipx7ra1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This season, at least 17 children in the United States have died from the flu, a number that will grow as more states report their numbers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last flu season, which spanned the winter between 2024 and 2025, set a record for the most pediatric deaths in a season, with 289.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000a3b6ssrpbecmn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year’s flu season has proved to be even busier than last year’s, with outpatient visits for “flu-like” symptoms reaching their highest level in nearly 30 years, driven by a new virus strain called subclade K. And infectious disease experts fear this year may turn out to be even deadlier than last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000b3b6ssyw3ur68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There was a strain that emerged after we had a chance to make the predictions for our current flu shots, so it was too late to change any of our vaccines,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Although subclade K isn’t included in this year’s shots, studies have shown that many people do generate antibodies against it when given the current flu vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000c3b6s2r9dmwjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, “we’re seeing what happens when there’s a bit of a mismatch and when enthusiasm over getting vaccinated is low, and again, that one-two punch is leading to a really significant flu year,” Creech said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000e3b6s0os0bg04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The flu arrived at the Rudds’ house in Ogden, Utah, on Christmas Day. &lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000f3b6sagma42ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sarah, a mom of four, was the first to get sick. She had it for about a week, she says. “It was pretty rough, but everybody else seemed to be just fine,” she remembers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000g3b6sigeefrp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then the baby, 14-month-old Dani, developed a fever that would come and go, but she seemed to bounce back quickly. After that, dad Michael also began having intermittent fevers. By the time he began feeling better, the three older children – Mary Jane, 6; Ellie; and 3-year-old Kyler – had caught it, too. They began showing symptoms on New Year’s Day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000h3b6sgzrvw7xm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Neither Michael nor I have ever had the flu shot before, and so we just don’t think about getting it,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000i3b6sv3si63ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Honestly, I don’t even know if it would have helped in this situation, as it seems like it might have been a different strain,” she said. “We don’t know.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000j3b6sl2101bb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the most part, Sarah says, people have been kind, but she and her husband have also been hurt by comments from strangers who second-guessed their medical decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000k3b6s0xh8uzq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I feel that we made the best choice that we could at the time,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000m3b6stggpb9v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Initially, Mary Jane seemed to be the worst off of the three older kids. Her fevers spiked to 102 degrees, so Sarah began alternating ibuprofen and Tylenol to keep them under control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000n3b6sdpf7zyid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellie and Kyler seemed to quickly return to their normal energetic selves after a dose of children’s ibuprofen that first morning, Sarah said, but by the next day, they were also spiking high fevers and needed more than one medicine to stay comfortable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000o3b6schxn6u7f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On January 2, Ellie fell asleep on the couch, so Sarah woke her up and sent her to bed.  A few minutes later, Kyler, who shares the bedroom with Ellie, walked out with his sister and said, “Mommy, Ellie needs you.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000p3b6sn5gnasep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellie’s cough had turned into a harsh bark, “and I was like ‘crap, what is that?’ ” Sarah said, “I didn’t like the sound of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000q3b6s4wrmejh7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sarah bundled Ellie up and drove her to a local hospital, where Ellie tested positive for both the flu and adenovirus, which can also cause respiratory illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000r3b6s9kw0iuf7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sarah learned that Ellie’s cough was called croup and was due to swelling around her vocal cords, which can happen with viral infections. An X-ray didn’t show any signs of pneumonia, but her blood oxygen level was only 85%, so the medical staff gave her some supplemental oxygen and the antiviral Tamiflu and told Sarah they wanted to keep her overnight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000s3b6s12w639pt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I thought they’d just give us something and send us home,” Sarah said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000t3b6s9incwijd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ellie woke up coughing throughout the night. She would cry a little and go back to sleep. Around 3 or 4 a.m., she began to complain of pain in her lower abdomen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000u3b6sbsynmhks@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next day, the attending doctor examined her and said everything was going well. The hospital was preparing to discharge her when her oxygen level began to drop again, and that afternoon, Ellie started throwing up blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000v3b6soz4lko0o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She was bleeding internally, but doctors didn’t know where the blood was coming from.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000w3b6s8u0faxop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A follow-up X-ray revealed that Ellie had developed pneumonia in one of her lungs overnight. She had also developed sepsis, overwhelming inflammation in the body in response to an infection. It can trigger a dangerous condition that causes both uncontrolled bleeding and clotting at the same time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000x3b6se8pasapv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Paramedics airlifted Ellie to Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, but they struggled to keep her blood oxygen up. At the hospital, Ellie was put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, a machine that takes over the work of the heart and lungs to give the body time to recover.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000y3b6suedby6t2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On January 5, the doctors explained that Ellie had developed blood clots in her heart, but she was too fragile for surgery to remove them. They discussed trying a blood thinning medication, but that was risky because she had already had internal bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq000z3b6sxv2lrblw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the Rudds were talking to doctors about Ellie’s dire situation, Sarah’s phone rang. It was her mother, who was watching the two older children, Kyler and Mary Jane, who were both still sick. Mary Jane had also developed pneumonia, along with bronchitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00103b6s6nxiz12n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was just an absolute … you know … shitshow, I want to say, but it’s too crass of a way to say it,” Sarah said. “There’s no other way to really say it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00113b6sfctdx7yl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was devastating,” she said. “It was absolute chaos and terrible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00123b6seaprwqyj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just with Ellie, everything was getting from bad to worse, and there was just never any good spot that we were in,” Sarah said. “I couldn’t stop crying for a while, and I felt like I’d lost all hope at that point. I tried to hold on to some hope, but there wasn’t much left.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00133b6sksrtxm7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It hit her so fast and so hard.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00143b6svcm2bwuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The blood thinners didn’t help. Twelve hours later, Ellie had a massive stroke.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00153b6s0embb5pg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The left side of her brain had no brain activity,” Sarah said. “It was just time to let her go at that point.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00173b6sewq9xhov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Creech, of Vanderbilt, said the details of Ellie’s story are tragic but familiar. He has seen some children with flu that gets worse very quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00183b6seypqdt0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We talk about this a lot in pediatrics. They don’t mean to, but young children often lie to us. They look like they are doing OK until they really aren’t,” he said.  “The younger the child is, the more quickly things can change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq00193b6s4kpvj1a4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he evaluates kids, he looks at three types of physical signs: How are they breathing?  Are there neurologic symptoms? Are they hydrated?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001a3b6svujcdjmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, parents should keep an eye on how fast a child is breathing and how hard they’re working to breathe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001b3b6sawmegnfp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Do they have tough or labored breathing, where they’re really having to tug at it to do it?” Creech said. “Are they having to use extra muscles around their neck or their ribs to breathe? That would be a red flag.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001c3b6sm0isrdmf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For neurologic symptoms, he says, it’s important to check to see if a child is lethargic, even if they don’t have a fever. Have they lost interest in eating or drinking or interacting with you?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001d3b6syw0zodnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that’s a really important feature, that they’re shunting all of their energy away from watching a show or interacting with you as a parent, to just trying to breathe and trying to stay in an OK spot,” Creech said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001e3b6s79aapysl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Finally, he says, a child who is breathing too fast can quickly become dehydrated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001f3b6syycu1w3j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And when kids get dehydrated, unfortunately, that makes them not want to drink even more. It makes them vomit, and so sometimes they get even further behind,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001g3b6s9w12h06m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another good test is whether kids feel better after medication. If Tylenol or ibuprofen brings their fever down, do they perk up?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001h3b6s6iv8wkyh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What most of us will do is give some Tylenol or give some Motrin and then, after about an hour, reassess. And if the child looks great, is drinking, is watching a show, OK, that makes us feel better,” he said. “But if they are now still feeling poorly, even when the fever comes down, that’s another one of those red flags for needing a little bit more evaluation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001j3b6sfozng3vt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Rudd family said their goodbyes to Ellie in the hospital on January 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001k3b6syx6xkvk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Family and friends have rallied around them as they struggle to get through each day without their daughter. Family members have &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/honoring-the-life-and-legacy-of-ellie-rudd" target="_blank"&gt;started a GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; to defray medical and funeral expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001l3b6s5lv9cgg5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sarah says the other kids are doing their best to cope.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001m3b6sz2pe2839@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The other day, we were dropping off a dress for Ellie to be buried in, and Kyler was asking if Ellie had her wings now and she was an angel up in heaven. And I said, ‘yes,’ because we are religious, and so I think he understands some, but I just don’t know how much,” Sarah said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001n3b6so2v2jm1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mary Jane is older and has been more subdued. She’s recovering well from her own illness, and “she’s finally started to kind of come back to herself.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001o3b6smf4vy7s3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Asked whether she had a message for other parents, Sarah said Ellie’s death had prompted the family to rethink the importance of flu shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001p3b6syfmkufoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Honestly, just get your flu shots,” she said. “Even if it doesn’t work this year, maybe it could have helped her a little bit. We don’t really know.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001q3b6s90zdib25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Probably next season, we’ll look into getting the flu shot for our kids and us,” Sarah said. “So just extra peace of mind.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001r3b6s6qu701xn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said it would be the first time anyone in their family had been vaccinated against the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmkg79lnq001s3b6szgl2hh0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’ve never been afraid of sickness before, but now I’m a little terrified.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

，使婴儿处于危险之中-新闻日报</title><link>https://www.newsday.com/news/health/vitamin-k-newborns-rse9qxl0</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="continue-reading ContinueReading_continue-reading__uTArZ active ContinueReading_active__SOMMR"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborn babies, federal data shows, which Long Island doctors said is leaving more&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;infants vulnerable to a rare but life-threatening bleeding disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of 5 million newborns revealed that the number of babies who did not receive the shot increased 77% from about 2.9% in 2017 to 5.2% in 2024, according to a &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/protective-vitamin-shots-newborns-decline"&gt;National Institutes of Health study&lt;/a&gt; released last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors on Long Island said they are seeing the ramifications in their hospitals, sometimes with serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="cke_bm_1451S"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Over the last two years, Stony Brook Children's Hospital has had to hospitalize at least five children who had not received the vitamin K dose, said Dr. Candice &lt;span id="cke_bm_1451E"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Foy, a pediatrician and medical director of the newborn nursery at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT NEWSDAY FOUND&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The number of parents refusing&lt;/strong&gt; vitamin K shots for their newborns has increased, according to a national study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts said newborns need a dose&lt;/strong&gt; of vitamin K after they are born to help their blood clot and prevent a rare but potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As mistrust of the medical field &lt;/strong&gt;has grown in recent years and social media provides  a flood of misinformation, doctors worry it is causing parents to question even routine treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year, there were more refusers than I had ever seen," she said. "We are seeing the repercussions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Heather Levin, an obstetrician/gynecologist who specializes in maternal fetal medicine at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, said she has also seen "the rates of refusal" increase over the last few years. She said parents are getting information from social media and questioning standard practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to have those conversations with them and for people to make informed choices, but there is also a lot of misinformation out there," Levin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though giving a shot of vitamin K — which is not a vaccine — has been a routine procedure at birth for decades, both doctors and vaccine skeptics attributed the drop to growing distrust with established medical practices and health policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the decline in vitamin K uptake and the growth in the number of people skeptical of claims made about vaccine safety are symptoms of the same issue: plummeting confidence in the truthfulness and accuracy of what we are told by health authorities," John Gilmore, of Long Beach, who heads the Autism Action Network and is a vocal critic of vaccine policies, told Newsday in an email. He pointed to COVID-19 guidance and the prescription opioid epidemic in particular as turning points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical associations and prominent physician groups &lt;a class="nd-link" href="/news/nation/childhood-vaccine-schedule-trump-rfk-hhs-p12647"&gt;have been alarmed&lt;/a&gt; by guidance coming out of the federal government and Trump administration regarding vaccine use, despite decades of evidence about their safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies are born deficient of vitamin K, which helps blood clot. This means a small bruise or cut can lead to abnormal bleeding, according to the NIH. Doctors are most concerned about a rare but deadly condition known as &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/about/index.html"&gt;vitamin K deficiency bleeding&lt;/a&gt;, or VKDB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They use up whatever clotting factors they were born with pretty quickly to heal after birth," Foy said. "Then they need something else."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infants who develop VKDB can experience the bleeding internally and on the brain, which can lead to permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest fear, medically, is spontaneous intracranial hemorrhaging," Levin said. "And I don't know if anybody knows why they happen, but vitamin K deficiency is associated with them. This is where you can see prevention of morbidity and mortality for newborns.&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children receive the dose shortly after birth, as part of a regimen that includes other procedures, like putting an antibiotic ointment on the child’s eyes to prevent infection. It's been routinely administered since 1961, when the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC also &lt;a class="nd-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/fact-sheet/index.html"&gt;recommends the shot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no way to accurately diagnose VKDB at birth, so doctors give the shot preventively, said Dr. Erika Banks, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Langone — Long Island. "If they are the unlucky few that have it, they are at risk for life-threatening bleeding into the brain and the bowel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We give it to all babies because it's just a vitamin," Banks said. "It doesn't do any harm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is an oral dose available, injection is the most effective way to get vitamin K into a newborn, doctors said, since they don’t absorb it well at that age. Once they are old enough to eat solid foods, they can get vitamin K naturally through leafy vegetables and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York State requires infants to get the vitamin K shot at birth but does not track administration or refusals, state health officials said Thursday. Some hospitals require parents who refuse the treatment to sign a consent form after having a consultation with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are pushing back with interventions in general and vitamin K, unfortunately, is one of them," Foy said. "And I think people are getting trapped to different algorithms on social media and not seeing both sides." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1392886/"&gt;A 1992 study&lt;/a&gt; out of England that looked at 195 children with cancer and 558 without suggested a link between vitamin K shots given to newborns and an increased risk of leukemia. Numerous follow-up studies concluded otherwise, including one from &lt;a class="nd-link" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2394315/"&gt;United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study Investigators&lt;/a&gt;, that looked at 2,530 children diagnosed with cancer and 4,487 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no convincing evidence that neonatal vitamin K administration, irrespective of the route by which it is given, influences the risk of children developing leukemia or any other cancer," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that questioning is an excellent thing," Banks said, "We never mind being questioned. I think what is concerning is a rising lack of trust of medical expertise on this because these practices save babies' and mothers' lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

			&lt;p&gt;A subtle change in brain wave activity could predict  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188866" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease more than two years before diagnosis, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signal could prove to be a sensitive biomarker of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a noninvasive imaging technique called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography"&gt;magnetoencephalography&lt;/a&gt; (MEG), neuroscientists at Brown University in the US and Spain's Complutense University of Madrid and &lt;span&gt;University of La Laguna&lt;/span&gt; analyzed the resting brain wave activity of 85 patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered distinct differences in the brain wave patterns of participants who went on to later develop Alzheimer's disease. This group produced beta waves at a lower rate, with weaker power, and with a shorter duration than those who did not progress to Alzheimer's within the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;There's One Critical Thing You Can Do to Keep Alzheimer's Symptoms at Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've detected a pattern in electrical signals of brain activity that predicts which patients are most likely to develop the disease within two and a half years," &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-08-01/alzheimers-biomarker"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-lead author and neuroscientist Stephanie Jones from Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being able to noninvasively observe a new early marker of Alzheimer's disease progression in the brain for the first time is a very exciting step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns are consistent with a critical shift in beta-wave activity that typically occurs around age 60 in healthy patients. From this point on, these bursts of activity tend to decline, but those with Alzheimer's typically show a faster progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07202-7"&gt;MEG imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; have linked tiny &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-waves-can-be-manipulated-while-we-dream-and-it-could-help-treat-dementia"&gt;brain wave changes&lt;/a&gt; to learning, memory, and executive function, supporting the use of the technique "as a biomarker of cognitive impairment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all depends on how the MEG readings are, well, read. They're often analyzed as averages, but this technique can skip over critical detail, argue the researchers behind the new study. They've&lt;span&gt; instead used a closer analytical technique.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta-wave bursts were ultimately shorter in those who went on to develop Alzheimer's. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2024.03.010"&gt;Some evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that beta-wave bursts throughout the brain are a signature of inhibitory control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, therefore, suspect that the ability to modulate beta-wave bursts according to the cognitive task at hand is necessary for optimal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The associated cognitive decline they observed in those who went on to develop Alzheimer's "may be directly related to lack of inhibitory cognitive control," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/IMAG.a.69"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunch aligns with a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf443"&gt;leading hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; that suggests Alzheimer's disease in its earliest stages is marked by hyperexcitable neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we've uncovered beta event features that predict Alzheimer's disease progression, our next step is to study the mechanisms of generation using computational neural modeling tools," &lt;a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-08-01/alzheimers-biomarker"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can recreate what's going wrong in the brain to generate that signal, then we can work with our collaborators to test therapeutics that might be able to correct the problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/IMAG.a.69"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imaging Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

By the time he made it to the hospital, it took doctors 10 days to diagnose him. In the meantime, he fell into a coma, suffered heart failure, his lungs filled with fluid, and his brain became inflamed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I was on the other side, with one foot in the other world," he told &lt;a href="https://www.dw.com/en/mosquito-bites-kill-thousands-yearly-dengue-malaria-zika-west-nile-virus/a-75090964" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Deutsche Welle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Deutsche Welle&lt;/a&gt;, which summarized his experience with West Nile virus, a disease that can be transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is West Nile virus concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While most people who contract West Nile virus may never know it, one in five will experience body aches and other flu-like symptoms, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10939-west-nile-virus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.

Each year, more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html#:~:text=Did%20you%20know?,more%20than%20130%20people%20die." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1,300;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;1,300&lt;/a&gt; Americans who have contracted West Nile develop severe illness that affects the central nervous system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 130 of those end up dying, the agency adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, cases of West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, and Zika are increasing, as rising global temperatures help mosquitoes to move into new territories and lengthen their active seasons. Many U.S. localities experienced surges in West Nile virus this year: Bell County in Texas reported six positive tests in six weeks, a spike in cases in one part of Utah led to one death, and the number of cases reported across the country in September was 40% higher than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about mosquito-borne diseases?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the most important things that anyone can do to avoid getting sick is to prevent mosquito bites. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; using Environmental Protection Agency-registered insect repellants; wearing long, loose-fitting clothing when you're outside and treating it with permethrin; and taking measures to control mosquitoes inside and outside the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many agencies assist with mosquito control efforts by spraying throughout local communities when needed. Some cities and counties are taking a more creative approach to mosquito control, too. For instance, one Florida county is using X-rays to sterilize male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This species can carry a number of mosquito-borne illnesses, including dengue and Zika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Get TCD's &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/newsletter/?utm_source=recbR9XvfwhgVByh5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletters&lt;/a&gt; for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive &lt;a href="https://links.thecooldown.com/rewards-club" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rewards Club;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Rewards Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 02:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNV05VX1pOM2d3OHd6S3FBVmZ0X1AyME8xZHdqM3hNbzF5bS1NMHRaNm9ZcEhZTHBSbV9GbHJGNE9OOFQ1SnMzY25Va2FHYXBTWFZmc08tQVpMdEU0V0x0OWRKMXZVN3FEVUFRUjBGYnVmME9oQ3NtTnBKU09zT08weVU1dw</guid></item><item><title>斯诺霍米什县宣布麻疹爆发，当地3名儿童检测呈阳性- KOMO</title><link>https://komonews.com/news/local/measles-outbreak-declared-in-snohomish-county-as-3-local-children-test-positive-outbreak-pandemic-vaccine-child-elementary-deadly-risk-tracking</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;EVERETT, Wash. — &lt;/span&gt;The Snohomish County Health Department has confirmed three new cases of measles in local children, prompting officials to declare an outbreak as the disease spreads within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the unvaccinated children were exposed to a contagious family visiting from South Carolina and tested positive on Jan. 14 after developing fever, cough, and a rash consistent with measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department notified the district on Wednesday of confirmed student cases at Serene Lake Elementary School and Pathfinder Kindergarten Center. Both schools will be closedon  Thursday, Jan. 16, to allow officials time to coordinate next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials warned that measles can spread before symptoms appear and before a rash develops. The virus can also remain in the air for up to two hours after an infectious person leaves an area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Snohomish County Health Department said the infected children were at the following public locations before being diagnosed. Anyone at these locations during the listed times may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jan. 9, 8:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m. — Pathfinder Kindergarten Center, 11401 Beverly Park Road, Everett&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jan. 9, 8:30 a.m.–5:15 p.m. — Serene Lake Elementary School, 9401 Sharon Drive, Everett&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jan. 13, 1:10–3:10 p.m. — Swedish Mill Creek Campus medical facility, 13020 Meridian Ave. S., Everett&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The times include two hours after the children were at each location, when the virus may have remained airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting more measles cases,” Snohomish County Health Officer Dr. James Lewis said. “There are likely more cases in the community that we do not know about yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said they were notified last week, along with Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, that three members of the South Carolina family were infectious while visiting King and Snohomish counties from Dec. 27 through Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged families to monitor for symptoms and contact a health care provider with concerns. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can cause serious complications, including brain swelling and death in rare cases, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information is available through the &lt;a href="https://www.snohd.org/460/Measles" target="_blank"&gt;Snohomish County Health Department.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Snohomish County Health Department has confirmed three new cases of measles in local children, prompting officials to declare an outbreak after determining the disease is now spreading within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the children were exposed to a contagious family visiting from South Carolina and tested positive for the virus on Jan. 14 after experiencing fever, cough, and a rash consistent with measles. The children were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department notified the district on Wednesday of three confirmed student cases, including one at Serene Lake Elementary School and another at Pathfinder Kindergarten Center. District officials said both schools will be closed Thursday, Jan. 16, to allow time to coordinate next steps with public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re expecting more measles cases as a result of the previous exposures as well as these new outbreak cases,” Snohomish County Health Officer Dr. James Lewis said. “We are hoping to contain it, but unfortunately, there have been a number of exposure sites already, and there are likely more cases in the community that we do not know about yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said they were notified last week, along with Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, that three members of the South Carolina family, one adult and two children, were infectious with measles while visiting King and Snohomish counties from Dec. 27, 2025, through Jan. 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, officials said, the family visited multiple locations in Everett, Marysville, and Mukilteo, traveled through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and visited a car rental facility near the airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged families and staff to monitor for measles symptoms and contact a health care provider with any health-related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re concerned about the health and safety of our Snohomish County children,” Health Department Director Kim Van Pelt said. “Measles is a serious disease that often brings unpleasant symptoms and, in rare cases, swelling of the brain and even death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a confirmed case of measles is identified, the Snohomish Health Department requires proof of immunity for all staff, students, and visitors to affected school buildings, according to the district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceptable proof of immunity includes documentation showing a birth date before 1957; records verifying two doses of a live measles-containing vaccine administered by a licensed health care provider; a signed letter from a licensed health care provider confirming previous measles infection and recovery; or laboratory evidence, such as a blood test or serology, demonstrating measles immunity, according to the Snohomish County Health Department&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about measles symptoms is available through the &lt;a href="https://www.snohd.org/460/Measles" target="_blank"&gt;Snohomish Health Department.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:52:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgJBVV95cUxOcWl5aDdwbGJxRG1wVmtjNkVXZmhCNkMzNzVpdUF3TldTNk42S0RmY1JLS2tWVW0xcVZJYklTNWZVYjVXMzhnY0MzUGJWdW1EZUU2ZGd5d2tGZnI1VTV1NzhZR3BHMzRQcHZIZ0tsQWJwdFAzNlZvVVlCbjBBUVlzbHNpanlmUGQ4Y21oY2laSzNwTEY1SXVScDlvMW5SU1kzSFpiUDQ0am1TT2hHYzZRV2ROMWhlS0NaWE12bDVaNlFDS3FVVGVsc3luNUgycFAyWXpOZkYtSUpzRG5PRkxyTVpkY05TM2FKSTFkOFU1LUNEM2NfTXZLZ2g2QnhKVjBxcVhsVnBR</guid></item><item><title>“寡妇制造者”心脏病发作幸存者谈论警告信号- WAVY.com</title><link>https://www.wavy.com/news/health/widowmaker-heart-attack-survivor-talks-warning-signs/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Waiting for the midterms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But pharmaceutical executives don’t appear comforted by the pushback. “Today it may be childhood vaccines or mRNA, but tomorrow it’s everything,” Noubar Afeyan, co-founder and chairman of Moderna, maker of mRNA vaccines, said. “We have to say not just ‘why is this happening?,’ but ‘Where will it stop?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bad flu season is underway, Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, noted that the anti-vaccine rhetoric is hitting seasonal flu shots. “With the pressure on vaccination, I cannot foresee flu vaccination increasing in this country over the next three years,” he said in a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson had a similarly pessimistic outlook. “It’s clear this administration has a particular sensitivity around vaccination, and indeed pediatric vaccination,” Hudson said. “I’m asked all the time ‘what are you going to do to fix this?,’ and the truth is we just need to stay extremely objective and continue presenting the evidence. There’s really very little else we can do,” except wait for the midterm elections, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will have to maintain a steely focus on the long-term future of vaccines and deal with any uncertainty around vaccine coverage rates in the short-term based on misinformation, Facebook posts, and statements from the top,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bourla also worried about the conditions Kennedy is creating to attack drug makers. Kennedy, who is an environmental lawyer with no scientific or medical background, has profited from lawsuits against vaccine makers, as have many of his allies and advisors. “There is also a lot of plaintiffs’ playbook there,” Bourla said. “Everybody will start litigating.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Flu season has taken a grim turn in Virginia, as the state’s health department has reported the first death of a child caused by complications associated with influenza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to protect the family’s privacy, the only information the Virginia Department of Health is releasing about the child is that they were age 4 or younger and that the death was reported in the eastern region of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We at the Virginia Department of Health, are broken hearted and extend our sympathies to the family of this child during this difficult time,” State Health Commissioner Karen Shelton &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/public-relations-contacts/2026-news-releases/virginia-health-officials-report-the-first-pediatric-flu-death-of-the-2025-2026-season/?utm_campaign=20260115_&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. “Even though the flu is common, it can cause serious illness and even death. I urge everyone who is eligible to receive the flu vaccine to do so not only to protect themselves, but to protect those around them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa Sollot, respiratory disease program coordinator with the state health department, told WTOP it’s not too late to get the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This year, we were afforded a few extra weeks because activity started so late that I think it may have given us a little extra time for those who are may be procrastinating getting the vaccine,” she said. “We know that activity could start increasing at any minute, and so we know that there’s a lot ahead of us in terms of activity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do recommend the flu vaccine as the best way to protect yourself and others,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sollot said it’s also important to take precautions, such as staying home when sick, avoiding others when they’re sick, cleaning high-tough surfaces and washing your hands frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since COVID-19 came into the picture, Sollot said flu season has become a bit more unpredictable and it’s important for people to remain vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Typically, activity starts in about October, maybe November. And this year, we really didn’t have activity start until about December. And then it climbed rapidly, almost reaching last year’s peak, before also declining quickly, which is strange activity that we haven’t seen in the past,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It has also made us think that this is not necessarily a true decline, and that it is possible that we could see activity surge again in the future, which is why these prevention tips are so important to help protect yourself and your family,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the state health department, less than 30% of eligible Virginians reported receiving a flu vaccine this season. Those interested in getting a flu shot can &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/provider-locator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;locate providers on the department’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The state health department said the level of respiratory illnesses are considered “moderate” — where over 18.6% of emergency department visits can be attributed to the viral illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last season was the deadliest flu season on record for children in the U.S., according to health officials in Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Wastewater testing can alert public health officials to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-south-carolina-utah-arizona-845643cd1342f1ce2ea01d11b74ee77b"&gt;measles infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; days to months before cases are confirmed by doctors, researchers said in two studies published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado health officials were able to get ahead of the highly contagious virus by tracking its presence in sewer systems, researchers wrote. And Oregon researchers found wastewater could have warned them of an outbreak more than two months before the first person tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings add to evidence that wastewater testing is a valuable weapon in tracking disease, including &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/334c8b4fcb5df44b25a058c724226d74"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-wastewater-climate-and-environment-8df014e9b38a70606c04234492bb3fb4"&gt;polio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/wastewater-mpox-covid-cdc-66a91045c9ea10924133506ff090d285"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cdc-8857e56c7b91d82613042beaba169a31"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;national wastewater surveillance system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, run by CDC since 2020, is newly at risk, under a Trump administration budget plan would slash its funding from about &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/pdf/CDC_Wastewater_Surveillance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$125 million a year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to about &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2026/fy-2026-cdc-cj.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$25 million&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Peggy Honein, director of the CDC’s division of infectious disease readiness and innovation, said the proposed funding level would “sustain some of the most critical activities” but “it would likely require some prioritization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The national system covers more than 1,300 wastewater treatment sites serving 147 million people. It includes six “centers for excellence” — Colorado among them — that innovate and support other states in expanding their testing. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;States brace for cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding cut is still a proposal, and Congress has started &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/house-democrats-republicans-vote-health-care-subsidies-7d69148c6619a190f8d4abb85a7344b8"&gt;pushing back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against cuts to health care in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But state health departments say they are preparing for a potential loss of federal support regardless. Most state programs are entirely federally funded, Honein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado started its wastewater surveillance program in 2020 with 68 utilities participating voluntarily. The program has since narrowed in its focus even as it grew to include more diseases, because it is 100% federally funded, said Allison Wheeler, manager of the Colorado’s wastewater surveillance unit.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The work is funded through 2029, Wheeler said, and the department is talking to state leaders about what to do after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know that there are other states that haven’t been as fortunate as us,” Wheeler said. “They need this funding in order to sustain their program for the next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles found in wastewater before patients are diagnosed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/75/wr/mm7502a2.htm?s_cid=OS_mm7502a2_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Colorado study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which Wheeler co-authored, officials started testing wastewater for measles in May, as outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico and Utah were growing and five cases had been confirmed in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, wastewater in Mesa County tested positive about a week before two measles cases were confirmed by a doctor. Neither patient knew that they had been exposed to measles. As they traced 225 household and health care contacts of the first two patients, health officials found five more cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/75/wr/pdfs/mm7502a1-H.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, researchers used preserved sewage samples from late 2024 to determine if sewage testing could have discovered a burgeoning outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30-case outbreak spanned two counties and hit a close-knit community that does not readily seek health care, the study’s authors wrote. The first case was confirmed on July 11 and it ultimately took health officials 15 weeks to stop the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that wastewater samples from the area were positive for measles about 10 weeks before the first cases were reported. The virus concentration in the wastewater over the weeks also matched the known peak of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that we were missing cases, and I think that’s always the case in measles outbreaks,” said Dr. Melissa Sutton, of the Oregon Health Authority. “But this gave us an insight into how much silent transmission was occurring without us knowing about it and without our health care system knowing about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;State see value in sewage tracking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states, such as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, have integrated wastewater data into their public-facing measles dashboards, allowing anyone to track outbreaks in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in New Mexico, where 100 people got measles last year and one died, the testing helped state health officials shrink a vast rural expanse. The state’s system flagged cases in northwestern Sandoval County while officials were focused on a massive outbreak 300 miles (483 kilometers) away in the southeast, said Kelley Plymesser, of the state health department. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The early warning allowed the department to alert doctors and the public, lower thresholds for testing and refocus their resources. The outbreak ended in September. But because measles continues to spread across the Southwest, the state is still using the system to look for new cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sutton, of Oregon, said she’s hopeful federal leaders will see the power of the system, its adaptability, affordability and reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The widespread use of wastewater surveillance in the United States is one of the greatest advancements in communicable disease surveillance in a generation,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

New findings suggest it can nudge your brain’s biology in a younger direction, at least as measured by brain scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 12 months, adults who stuck with regular cardio ended the year with brains that looked almost a year “younger” than those who kept their usual activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by the &lt;a href="https://www.adventhealth.com/institute/adventhealth-research-institute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AdventHealth Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, focused on “brain age” – an MRI-based estimate of how old a brain appears relative to a person’s actual age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A higher brain-predicted age difference, or brain-PAD, signals a brain that looks older than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked higher brain-PAD to worse physical and cognitive outcomes and a higher risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-measuring-the-brain-s-age"&gt;Measuring the brain’s age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many brain health studies rely on tests of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-the-brain-remembers-what-a-memory-feels-like/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; or attention, or they wait for clear clinical changes to appear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study leaned on imaging and asked a different question: can lifestyle shift an early biological marker before problems show up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used MRI scans to estimate &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brains-age-might-be-older-than-you-are/"&gt;brain age&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the study and again at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main number they tracked was brain-PAD, the gap between a person’s predicted brain age and their real age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that a simple, guideline-based &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exercise-significantly-lowers-heart-disease-risk-by-reducing-stress/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; program can make the brain look measurably younger over just 12 months,” said lead author Lu Wan, a data scientist at the AdventHealth Research Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people worry about how to protect their brain health as they age. Studies like this offer hopeful guidance grounded in everyday habits. These absolute changes were modest, but even a one-year shift in brain age could matter over the course of decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-clinical-trial"&gt;Inside the clinical trial&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trial enrolled 130 healthy adults between 26 and 58 years old. Participants were randomly assigned either to an exercise program or to a usual-care control group that didn’t change its activity routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the aerobic group followed a plan designed to match widely used fitness guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They completed two supervised 60-minute sessions each week in a lab setting and added home exercise to reach roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That target mirrors the American College of Sports Medicine’s (&lt;a href="https://acsm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ACSM&lt;/a&gt;) recommendations for moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track changes beyond the MRI, the team also measured cardiorespiratory fitness using peak oxygen uptake, known as VO2peak, at the beginning and end of the 12-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-slowed-brain-aging"&gt;Exercise slowed brain aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the year, the exercise group’s brain-PAD dropped by about 0.6 years on average. In plain terms, their brains looked a little younger at follow-up than they did at baseline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The control group moved in the opposite direction, with an average increase of about 0.35 years, though that shift wasn’t statistically significant on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What stood out most was the gap between groups. When the researchers compared the two trajectories, the difference in brain age was close to one full year, in favor of the people who exercised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though the difference is less than a year, prior studies suggest that each additional ‘year’ of brain age is associated with meaningful differences in later-life health,” said senior author Kirk I. Erickson, a neuroscientist and director at AdventHealth Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a lifespan perspective, nudging the brain in a younger direction in midlife could be very important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-biological-pathways"&gt;Possible biological pathways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is known to improve many things that should, in theory, support brain health: cardiovascular function, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-minimum-amount-of-physical-activity-needed-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure/"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, body composition, and certain molecules involved in neural plasticity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tried to see whether any of these changes could explain the shift in brain-PAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They examined several candidates, including fitness improvements, changes in body composition, and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also looked at levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) – a protein often linked to learning, memory, and the brain’s ability to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2026/01/15140146/exercise-fitness_impact-on-brain-aging_infographic_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2026/01/15140150/exercise-fitness_impact-on-brain-aging_infographic_1s.webp" alt="Fitness and exercise effects on brain age: A randomized clinical trial.

The answer may involve multiple small changes happening at once, or changes the study didn’t measure in enough detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-case-for-early-prevention"&gt;The case for early prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of exercise-and-brain research concentrates on older adults, when age-related changes are more obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial aimed earlier, in early to mid-adulthood, when decline can be subtle and prevention may have more runway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is not that people in their 30s, 40s, or 50s are already destined for cognitive problems. It’s that brain aging is gradual, and intervening sooner might shift the slope in a way that pays off later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Intervening in the 30s, 40s and 50s gives us a head start,” Erickson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can slow brain aging before major problems appear, we may be able to delay or reduce the risk of later-life cognitive decline and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-brain-aging-research"&gt;Future brain aging research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that the volunteers were healthy and relatively well educated, which can limit how broadly the results apply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain age changes were also modest, even if the between-group difference was meaningful in context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While brain-PAD is a promising biomarker, it’s still a proxy. Larger studies and longer follow-ups are needed to see whether shaving down brain age on MRI translates into fewer strokes or less dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional research will also be needed to determine whether a reduced brain age leads to other measurable reductions in brain-related disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, for people looking for something practical to do now, the takeaway is refreshingly straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People often ask, ‘Is there anything I can do now to protect my brain later?’” Erickson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings support the idea that following current exercise guidelines – 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity – may help keep the brain biologically younger, even in midlife.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2095254625000602" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Sport and Health Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 21:18:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOUjZVNEI0ajlPMG11ZTVWRDBxbmkxZ3A0amxmVW9UeTlfc1Y3SjJDRXQtN2FRWTZnY3NTQ3NsNTl4RHFXV3VMQ2pwZFFJdlBqT2VUbDlMbm5mREJMXzFlc29aUXJ4NDFZOXRoVURqVUVPenNNem5VVEZON0dudEMwYTZQczB2cVZjT0tJT3pCaWc2UmxCSzZWX0RzeEUyUTdoRlhpdTdvNGNDQQ</guid></item><item><title>研究表明， “过度游戏”可能会损害您的健康- GameSpot</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/articles/excessive-gaming-could-be-damaging-your-health-study-suggests/1100-6537443/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="js-content-entity-body content-entity-body" data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;We're called GameSpot, so we clearly love to play some video games. You're reading stories on this site called GameSpot, so it's safe to assume that you love to play some video games, too. However, we all need to be careful with how long we play video games because a new study suggests that logging too many hours could seriously hurt our physical, emotional, and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900725003685?via%3Dihub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;a new study published in ScienceDirect's Nutrition journal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-reveals-hours-video-games-week.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;reported on by Medical Xpress&lt;/a&gt;, 10 different researchers from around the world investigated the effects "excessive gaming" has on young people. Led by Professor Mario Siervo of the Curtin School of Population Health in Perth, Western Australia, and surveying 317 students from five Australian universities with a median age of 20 years old, the study found that "high gamers"--people whose playtime exceeded 10 hours a week--were at greater risk of dietary issues, sleep deprivation, and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What stood out was students gaming up to 10 hours a week all looked very similar in terms of diet, sleep, and body weight," Siervo said. "The real differences emerged in those gaming more than 10 hours a week, who showed clear divergence from the rest of the sample."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(It's worth noting that 317 students across five universities in one country is an incredibly small sample size.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside "high gamers" (10+ hours per week), the researchers split the participants into "low gamers" (0–5 hours per week) and "moderate gamers" (5–10 hours), depending on the self-reported amount of time they spent playing video games. In these categories, the researchers found that high gamers experienced a decline in diet quality and an increase in obesity when compared to low and moderate gamers. For example, according to the study, high gamers had a median body mass index (BMI) of 26.3 kg/m2 (generally considered overweight), compared to 22.2 kg/m2 and 22.8 kg/m2 (generally considered normal or healthy weight ranges) for low and moderate gamers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while all three groups reported generally poor sleep quality, moderate and high gamers scored worse here than low gamers, with their hours spent gaming being a significant disruptor to the quality of their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each additional hour of gaming per week was linked to a decline in diet quality, even after accounting for stress, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors," Siervo explained in the findings. "This study doesn't prove gaming causes these issues, but it shows a clear pattern that excessive gaming may be linked to an increase in health risk factors. Our data suggests low and moderate gaming is generally fine, but excessive gaming may crowd out healthy habits such as eating a balanced diet, sleeping properly, and staying active."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not all bad, though. Siervo said that there's hope for young people whose college habits may carry over into their adulthood: change their behavior before the habit becomes an identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because university habits often follow people into adulthood," Siervo said. "Healthier routines such as taking breaks from gaming, avoiding playing games late at night, and choosing healthier snacks may help improve their overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of us? Well, the jury's still out.&lt;/p&gt;

Studies published in major medical journals have reported that microplastics are plentiful in seemingly every inch of the human body and they have attracted widespread media attention. Most of us have gotten the message loud and clear: &lt;em&gt;These manmade materials can’t be good for us, and ungodly amounts of them are already lurking inside our bodies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Settled science, right?

Covering a range of studies, the report cites both interviews with leading subject matter experts and scholarly reviews to challenge this narrative of human bodies teeming with deadly molecules. The critics ask: How confident can we really be about how much of this stuff is inside us, given the challenges in measuring anything at the molecular level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These studies were primarily focused on the prevalence of microplastics in samples taken from real people; other research has focused on &lt;a href="https://plastchem-project.org/#report"&gt;the ways plastics harm health&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34654571/"&gt;the population-level health effects&lt;/a&gt; as plastics have become so woven into our lives. The type of research in question attempts to discern exactly how much these substances have penetrated people’s bodies, which was what led to those eye-grabbing headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But, according to the Guardian’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/13/microplastics-human-body-doubt"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt;, some researchers are calling foul on a number of methodological problems with these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; that inspired headlines of brains soaked in microplastics, researchers who were not involved noted that fatty cells in the brain have a history of throwing up false positives for polyethylene, a microplastic of concern. They also flagged the possibility that microplastics from the lab environment could have contaminated the samples, a concern raised about other studies covered by the Guardian and an unavoidable challenge for this kind of research; microplastics are literally &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="sign-up-for-the-good-medicine-newsletter" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Sign up for the Good Medicine newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Our political wellness landscape has shifted: new leaders, shady science, contradictory advice, broken trust, and overwhelming systems. How is anyone supposed to make sense of it all? Vox’s senior correspondent &lt;a href="/authors/dylan-scott"&gt;Dylan Scott&lt;/a&gt; has been on the health beat for more than a decade, and every week, he’ll wade into sticky debates, answer fair questions, and contextualize what’s happening in American health care policy.

The fact is, this is something that happens a lot: New science gets overconfidently reported either by the researchers themselves or by journalists, driving people and policymakers to react even when the underlying evidence is more uncertain than the popular narrative suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is an important lesson in this story, not only for how we think about these microplastics but for how we should internalize scientific findings that have major implications for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="this-is-how-science-is-supposed-to-work" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;This is how science is supposed to work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Let’s start here: The media bears some blame for the microplastics mania. We tend to sensationalize and oversimplify findings because we’re writing for a lay audience and we need to capture people’s interest. Take the Guardian story itself: This debate between academics has been playing out in public in the &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; journal since &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04045-3"&gt;November&lt;/a&gt;, though this week’s story &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/jan/13/microplastics-human-body-doubt"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; itself as “a bombshell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;No one is accusing researchers of malpractice here. This is purely a question of methodology and our ability to measure the human body at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I spoke with co-authors of the brain study, and they pointed out that they actually did flag in their paper the possibility that fatty molecules could confound their research. But they argued the size of the effect they tracked over time was too significant to be explained by that factor alone. The news stories covering the study often didn’t mention that nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And to be fair, microplastics research is a fairly young space. This is inherently difficult and scientists should be striving to fine-tune their methods so they can report findings with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s how the scientific method is supposed to work: You collect data, you report it, you get critiqued, you keep working to duplicate and build upon your findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Nobody’s getting it perfect,” Matthew Campen, a biochemist at the University of New Mexico and co-author of the brain study, told me. “But when you start combining the best practices, all of a sudden, I think in a year, maybe two, we’re going to have this unassailable approach, and we’re going to have really accurate and consistent data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is &lt;a href="/health/414241/medical-diagnosis-cancer-autism-long-covid"&gt;a broader phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; across medical science and diagnostics: We have developed shockingly precise tools for measuring things in the human body, but our ability to understand what we are seeing is still catching up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s okay. As we gather more information and improve our technology, we should be able to get better at interpreting the signals. But it takes time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-smarter-way-to-think-about-microplastics-and-your-health" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A smarter way to think about microplastics and your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We should be clear about something: These critiques are largely aimed at studies that have measured the prevalence of microplastics in our bodies, taking (in the case of the brain study) samples collected during autopsies and scouring them to come up with a measure of how many microplastics are present. But this is just one lane of microplastics research, and the broader field is focused on piecing together how microplastics might actually impact our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Experimental research has &lt;a href="https://plastchem-project.org/#report"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; over and over again that the chemicals present in plastics are toxic to humans. Population cohort studies have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34654571/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that exposure to, for example, phthalate is associated with a higher risk of death from any cause, but especially cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“What I tell people is plastic is toxic, so try to avoid it where you can,” said Renee Sharp, an environmental health expert at the Natural Resource Defense Council. “That can be challenging because it’s everywhere, and it’s even in places that we don’t even necessarily want it. But do what you can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With that in mind, we don’t have to overreact to every new scientific finding or media fixation. Remember the black spatula freakout? A popular article &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/10/black-plastic-spatula-flame-retardants/680452/"&gt;published in the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; suggested that your plastic cookware is probably leaching nanoparticles into your food. Ack! I went out and bought some nylon cookware, just to be safe. You had writers like &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/08/microplastics-exposure-health-risks/683249/"&gt;Annie Lowrey at the Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; trying to eliminate plastic entirely from their lives (before giving up because it proved too hard). Then, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/11/black-plastic-spatula-chemicals-flame-retardants.html"&gt;a counter-take&lt;/a&gt; argued the Atlantic’s story had overinterpreted the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Don’t subject yourself to this cycle. Plastics are everywhere, and they aren’t good for your health. But let’s also put the risk in a proper context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Campen, the co-author of the brain study, put it to me like this: “Let’s not panic.” While there is understandable trepidation about all the artificial substances in our modern world, in the context of history, we seem to be doing ok: people are &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#:~:text=Across%20the%20world%2C%20people%20are%20living%20longer.,had%20more%20than%20doubled%20to%2071%20years."&gt;living longer than ever&lt;/a&gt;. Chronic diseases are becoming &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/healthcare-medicine-policy-future/#:~:text=A%20recent%20report%20suggests%20advances,expanded%20to%20lung%20cancer%20screening."&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;, not less, manageable. There are particular concerns associated with microplastics that we are still trying to understand, such as early-onset cancer, but we are also living in a golden age of medicine and longevity — one made possible, in part, by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2023/11/08/default-calendar/who-health-dialogue--plastics-in-health-care"&gt;plastics in medical care&lt;/a&gt;. (There is, at the same time, a growing conversation about how to decrease plastic use in hospitals and clinics — our relationship to this stuff is complicated.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And that means we shouldn’t just stop worrying about microplastics either. “Don’t overreact” cuts both ways. One way to interpret the Guardian story is: If we don’t have as much plastic inside of us as we thought, maybe we can do more to mitigate our plastic risk before it’s too late. It’s tempting to get fatalistic about our exposure when it seemed like they were really everywhere and already inside you. Don’t be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Instead, as you start hearing about new science like this, look for “low pain” interventions, something you can do to try to reduce risk based on our limited knowledge, but without totally upending your life, given the inherent uncertainty. The NRDC has &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2025-06/10_things_you_can_do_to_reduce_your_and_your_familys_exposure_to_microplastics.pdf"&gt;a list of practical tips&lt;/a&gt;: Drink tap water, not bottled water, when possible; don’t microwave any food in plastic; when you can, opt for bamboo cutting boards or glass mixing bowls instead of plastic ones. You can check if any of your cosmetics include ingredients like polyethylene or nylon-12: if so, consider something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;And whenever the next popular health panic starts, remember: We are learning new things all the time, and some of those things could dramatically reshape how we think about our health. This is a good thing. But good science does take time. Do what you can, don’t freak out at every new headline, and let the researchers keep working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNRjNIOWRrYlRzdnV6SmFfakc4Y2JLOGRWVHl4U0xwR1plQmV4VHRUWDZDVlZ4OEFwbXM1NzJFaXgzV3N3V0N3VWRiZm8wakN5VlJaVVdtTGdDdHVGc3JGWDZMZFNVUEdWdWJ6RU40RE1laWRYX05ZVGZlcUl6Y1dMdnZCUTB3bF8wWHgxQw</guid></item><item><title>最后，与癌症作斗争的一些好消息- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/finally-some-good-news-in-the-fight-against-cancer-2000710820</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Positive news about cancer can be hard to come by. Recent studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cancer-increasing-for-under-50-study-1850812960"&gt;cancer rates are rising among young people&lt;/a&gt; and that many ubiquitous aspects of modern life—from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-to-find-out-if-microplastics-are-actually-destroying-our-health-2000642886"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-upsetting-truth-about-what-wildfire-smoke-does-to-your-body-2000612628"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;—may increase the risk of developing cancer. But the American Cancer Society’s latest report on U.S. cancer statistics delivers a healthy dose of optimism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings, &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.70043"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, show for the first time that 70% of all cancer patients survived at least five years after being diagnosed between 2015 and 2021. That’s a major improvement since the mid-1970s, when the five-year survival rate was just 49%, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This stunning victory is largely the result of decades of cancer research that provided clinicians with the tools to treat the disease more effectively, turning many cancers from a death sentence into a chronic disease,” lead author Rebecca Siegel, ACS senior scientific director of cancer surveillance research, &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/cancer-statistics-report-2026"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Even the deadliest cancers are more survivable&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Siegel and her colleagues compiled the most recent population-based data from cancer registries and the National Center for Health Statistics to assess trends in cancer incidence and outcomes. Five years is a common benchmark for measuring cancer survival because cancers that don’t recur within five years rarely return, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/cancer-survival-rate?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Their analysis revealed that survival gains since the mid-1990s have been especially significant for patients diagnosed with more fatal cancers, including myeloma (from 32% to 62%), liver cancer (7% to 22%), and lung cancer (15% to 28%).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five-year survival has also improved dramatically for patients diagnosed with advanced cancers, doubling from 17% to 35% for all cancers combined. For the three in four people diagnosed with lung cancer at an advanced stage, five-year survival has increased from 20% to 37% among locally advanced cancer patients and from 2% to 10% among metastatic cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In all, the report’s authors estimate more effective treatments, improvements in early detection, and a reduction in smoking prevented 4.8 million cancer-related deaths between 1991 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, marginalized groups continue to face an elevated risk of cancer compared to the general population. The report found that Native American people have the highest risk of cancer mortality, including death rates double those of white people for kidney, liver, stomach, and uterine cervix cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Lack of access to high-quality cancer care and socioeconomics continues to play a significant role in persistent racial disparities,” senior author Ahmedin Jemal, ACS senior vice president of cancer surveillance, prevention, and health services research, said in the release. “Efforts need to be focused on these areas so successful targeted cancer control interventions can be more broadly and equitably applied to all populations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rising diagnoses and threats to progress&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okay, now for the bad news. Despite marked improvements in survival rates, cancer remains the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. The report’s authors estimate that more than 2 million new cancer diagnoses will occur in 2026, and more than 600,000 will die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In fact, the report finds that the incidence of many common cancers is on the rise, including breast, prostate, oral, pancreas, and endometrial cancers. Among women, incidence of liver cancer and melanoma is also increasing. At the same time, the Trump administration threatens to undo U.S. progress in reducing cancer deaths by implementing &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/trumps-latest-nih-purge-claims-another-200-jobs-and-the-cancer-hotline-2000598598"&gt;sweeping funding and staff cuts&lt;/a&gt; across multiple research institutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For decades, the federal government has been the largest funder of cancer research, which has translated to longer lives for people with even the most fatal cancers,” Shane Jacobson, CEO of ACS and its Cancer Action Network, said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“But now, threats to cancer research funding and significant impact to access to health insurance could reverse this progress and stall future breakthroughs,” he added. “We can’t stop now. There is still much work to be done.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The big takeaway from this report is that investment in cancer research saves lives. The survival gains Americans have seen over the past five decades would not have been possible without the development of new treatments, early detection methods, and extensive investigation into the causes of cancer. Whether the U.S. continues to bend the cancer mortality curve will now depend on whether policymakers choose to sustain—or undermine—those investments.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Under his leadership, federal health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have pivoted their policies and recommendations away from established science to align with Kennedy’s antivaccine ideology.

She initially dismissed it, thinking it was just a heavy period, and continued her day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/other/teen-has-spinal-stroke-after-symptoms-dismissed-as-period-pain/ar-AA1UbDF8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Southwest News Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Southwest News Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It all happened so quickly,” her sister-in-law Chloe, 30, said. “The only symptom she had was a bit of shoulder and back pain, she thought it might be backache or her period starting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, Gorman later started struggling to breathe and lost feeling in her arms and hands.

Although the agency did not provide specific data for California cases, it described the seasonal flu activity as “elevated” in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flu started to rise, in earnest, by mid-December and rates are still up,” said Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente. “We are hoping to see some plateauing in the next few weeks, but there’s some delay in data due to recent holidays, so it will become clearer in the next week or so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson said most flu-related cases are being treated without the need for hospital admittance, “but those who are older or at higher risk for complications from the flu are the ones we’re mostly seeing admitted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/RespiratoryVirusReport.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;data from the public health agency&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a high rate of positive flu cases in Central California and the Bay Area and a moderate rate around Sacramento and Southern California. In the northern part of the state where it’s more rural, the rate of flu cases is currently low, according to the  agency’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/#Hospitalizations" target="_blank"&gt;recent data from the health department&lt;/a&gt; show that between the end of last year and the start of 2026, there were 162 flu-related hospitalizations and an additional 18 cases in which patients were admitted for intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, this flu season has led to the highest number of cases in the U.S. in more than 30 years. The &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates&lt;/a&gt; that there have been at least 15 million infections in the U.S., with 180,000 hospitalizations and 7,400 deaths, since late fall. At least two of those who died have been children, said Yvonne Maldonado, the Taube professor of global health and infectious disease at Stanford Medicine, &lt;a class="link" href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2026/01/not-super-flu-but-plenty-bad-expert-tips.html" target="_blank"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. The state’s Department of Public Health  confirmed that those pediatric flu-associated deaths occurred in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, infectious disease experts had &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-23/flu-season-hits-california-early-doctors-worry-itll-be-hard-on-kids"&gt;predicted this flu season would be particularly bad for high-risk groups, specifically children&lt;/a&gt;, due to a decline in flu vaccination rates and a “souped-up mutant” flu strain, Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at UC San Francisco, told The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year’s flu season was one of the worst, “but little did we know what was in store for us this year,” said Dr. Neha Nanda, medical director of antimicrobial stewardship with Keck Medicine of USC.  Nanda said she is seeing an early upward trend in positive influenza cases this season compared with previous years, though it isn’t quite on par with last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sam Torbati, co-chair and medical director of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center’s emergency department, said that around the second week of December he saw a lot of patients coming into his department with flu-related illnesses, part of a surge in hospitalizations that was seen throughout the county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he doesn’t recall “seeing this many patients becoming this ill.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very early in the flu season and may get much worse,” Torbati said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts believe the strain has mutated to “more likely evade” immunity from the current vaccine. That’s because the strain emerged toward the end of the summer, long after health officials had already determined the formula for the flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current seasonal flu vaccines remain effective at reducing severe illness and hospitalization, including the currently circulating viruses,” said Dr. Erica Pan,  state public health officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the flu shot might not keep you from succumbing to the illness, “it lessens your odds of having a severe case, keeps you out of the hospital and shortens the duration of the illness,” said Dr. Michelle Barron, senior medical director of infection prevention and control for UCHealth, in a report by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aamc.org/news/10-things-know-about-year-s-surprisingly-fierce-flu-season" target="_blank"&gt;Assn. of American Medical Colleges&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are urging the public, especially those at higher risk for severe flu complications such as the very young and older populations, to get vaccinated or take immediate antiviral treatment, such as Tamifu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu can be very serious with symptoms — fatigue, fever, cough and body aches — that feel like you got “hit by a Mack truck,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For children and other high-risk individuals, the symptoms can be more severe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Children can develop dehydration [or] pneumonia, and more severe cases of flu in kids can lead to inflammation of the brain and heart,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem has not been limited to the U.S. The influenza A strain, H3N2 subclade K, has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-25/california-flu-season-could-see-early-sharp-start-due-to-mutation"&gt;caused severe flu seasons in&lt;/a&gt; Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 20:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPTWdvNGg0bVhUeGRwUkYyT3Bhck1IQTVrZm5NbUdjYTlLS01GeGp3d2NjWEVvb2xlekhWaFZXYmFoalNqQUpBb2JGTm9YcXBCZVBfY3dqMmRnN2g2X0hqWENiTlQxN2lIWjJGVnJ0cWR2Q215bmdoWS1hRDdtQXdkbVAtVmZsOUJYdVVlRkZoQXNybldVbGxhTERUVmU4Yi1EMDRPSl8wMXJoN2lzX0dnQnlSbw</guid></item><item><title>县卫生官员确认的凤凰城地区首例麻疹病例- KTAR News 92.3 FM</title><link>https://ktar.com/arizona-health-news/measles-maricopa-county-case/5807315/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;PHOENIX – Maricopa County health officials reported the Phoenix area’s first measles case of 2026 on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient, an adult who lives in the Valley, required hospitalization, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/m/newsflash/Home/Detail/3568" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Maricopa County Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; (MCDPH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is associated with overseas international travel, although the patient was not infectious while traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because of the ongoing transmission both in the United States as well as abroad, there is a risk with international travel to be exposed to measles, and so we highly encourage obviously everyone to be vaccinated, but especially if you are having international travel,” Dr. Nick Staab, MCDPH chief medical officer, told &lt;em&gt;KTAR News 92.3 FM&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are working to notify anybody who might have been exposed. They declined to disclose the infected person’s vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals say vaccines are the best way to avoid getting the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no other way to prevent measles as effectively,” Staab said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCDPH recommends two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, which is 97% effective, for all children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, adults who aren’t immunized should get at least one dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is “very easy to catch just by being in the same space is someone who is infectious with measles. You can even be infected with measles up to two hours after the infectious person has left that area,” Staab said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms, which typically appear a week or two after exposure, can include a high fever, cough, runny nose, diarrhea, watery eyes and a full-body rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody with those symptoms should self-isolate and contact their medical provider for instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How many measles cases does Arizona have?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona had 220 measles cases in 2025, most of them from an outbreak near the Utah border in Mohave County, &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Arizona Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until Thursday’s news out of Maricopa County, the state had three confirmed cases in 2026, all in Mohave County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2025, MCDPH warned about a &lt;a href="https://ktar.com/arizona-health-news/measles-exposure/5775236/" target="_blank"&gt;potential exposure&lt;/a&gt; at the Tate McRae concert at Mortgage Matchup Center in Phoenix and a nearby hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, the &lt;a href="https://ktar.com/arizona-health-news/measles-phoenix-airport/5718120/" target="_blank"&gt;disease was confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in a person who traveled through Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in June.&lt;/p&gt;

Many popular digital apps are even free to use, making them a natural starting point for your health journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But do weight-loss apps actually work? We wanted to see what professionals think about popular weight loss and health apps, so we spoke with two registered dietitians. They explained the benefits of weight-loss apps — as well as the potential downsides — and recommended a few programs to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="what-are-the-benefits-of-weight-loss-apps"&gt;What are the benefits of weight-loss apps?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are trying to lose weight, multiple studies have shown that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2021/02/digital-health-tracking-tools-help-individuals-lose-weight-study-finds.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:digital tools increase success rates;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;digital tools increase success rates&lt;/a&gt;. "The act of tracking helps increase awareness of what foods individuals are actually consuming," explains Amy Davis, RD, a nutrition consultant with &lt;a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;linkText=Live+Conscious&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3dlbGl2ZWNvbnNjaW91cy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NzBhMjk1Ny02OTA1LTQzNjUtODhjNy05MWNkMzA2NmE0MTYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd2VsaXZlY29uc2Npb3VzLmNvbS8ifQ&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAdpZdUpcPhJYAyiUIf76_djzzCLGM1AzChtPx3Mq4LnH&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fweliveconscious.com%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803369" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Live Conscious;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Live Conscious&lt;/a&gt;. "That awareness is often enlightening and helps people make healthier decisions because they don't want to 'track' a not-so-healthy choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to creating awareness of habits, weight loss apps also help showcase your progress: "Whether you’re tracking food intake, water, sleep, steps, or habits, logging gives you something objective to look at over time," says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://signup.usenourish.com/providers/gabby-zeagler" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gabby Zeagler;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gabby Zeagler&lt;/a&gt;, RD, a clinical dietitian at Nourish. "If you’re not tracking anything, it’s hard to know whether you’ve actually made progress or what might need adjusting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have also found that the more you engage with your weight loss app, the better your results will be. So it's important to select an app that's convenient and enjoyable to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="are-there-any-downsides"&gt;Are there any downsides?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight-loss apps can be a helpful tool on your health journey, but they may not work for everyone. "For some individuals, constant tracking can feel stressful or lead to an obsessive focus on numbers rather than overall well-being," explains Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Used improperly, tracking can shift from a tool for insight to a source of guilt or pressure, which is when it stops being helpful," notes Zeagler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to realize that not all calorie estimates may be accurate. "Food databases and calorie estimates are not always precise, which means you're tracking information that isn't actually true or helpful," says Davis. For this reason, it's a good idea to double-check nutrient information when using barcode scanning or logging pre-made foods in an app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Some apps, including Weight Watchers, allow you to log foods using photos.&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt; (Weight Watchers)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="what-to-look-for-in-a-weight-loss-app"&gt;What to look for in a weight loss app&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of weight-loss apps out there today, but there are several key features you'll want to look for when selecting the best option for your needs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food logging: &lt;/strong&gt;The main feature to look for in a weight loss app is food logging, which will allow you to keep track of your calorie intake throughout the day. (After all, at its most basic, weight loss is all about staying in a calorie deficit.) Some apps require you to manually enter foods, while others allow you to scan barcodes or even take photos of your meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; There are many factors that contribute to weight loss, including activity, sleep, and water intake. Experts recommend looking for an app that allows you to easily track all these habits: "When everything lives in one app, it’s easier to build routines instead of juggling multiple platforms," says Zeagler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight tracking: &lt;/strong&gt;To keep track of your weight loss progress, you'll want an app that includes a weight tracking option that displays your progress over time. Some apps can even sync with a smart scale, automatically pulling in weight data. Other apps also allow you to log progress photos for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community: &lt;/strong&gt;Many people also benefit from some type of community or social feature within a weight loss app. "Whether it’s friends, challenges, or peer support, feeling connected and engaged can significantly improve motivation and consistency," Zeagler explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="caas-jump-link-heading" id="the-best-weight-loss-apps-according-to-dietitians"&gt;The best weight-loss apps, according to dietitians&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked our experts which weight loss apps they recommend, and they offered several suggestions that they've used themselves or recommend to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-rmp"&gt;&lt;div id="25c2bdbec6dd46699cd1e16b2d232a81"&gt;&lt;div class="commerce productModule [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:mt-9 [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-t [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-dirty-seagull [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:pt-2 [&amp;amp;+:not(.productModule)]:mt-10 col-body" id="product-module-25c2bdbec6dd46699cd1e16b2d232a81"&gt;&lt;div class="mt-6 text-batcave @container/p dark:text-grey-hair"&gt;&lt;div class="block @xl/p:flex @xl/p:gap-6"&gt;&lt;div class="relative mb-4 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border border-grey-hair pb-[75%] @xl/p:mb-0 @xl/p:h-[165px] @xl/p:w-[220px] @xl/p:flex-none @xl/p:pb-0"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768488917197;cpos:1;itmId:Download;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768488917197;pdid:MyFitnessPal;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:MyFitnessPal;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;slk:Download at MyFitnessPal;pkgt:horizontal-img;pos:1;" class="rapid-with-clickid group absolute size-full @xl/p:relative" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=514605a6-8316-49ff-8b3d-5f4fdf6a6af8&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=MyFitnessPal&amp;amp;merchantName=MyFitnessPal&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5teWZpdG5lc3NwYWwuY29tL2VuIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NzBhMjk1Ny02OTA1LTQzNjUtODhjNy05MWNkMzA2NmE0MTYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15Zml0bmVzc3BhbC5jb20vZW4ifQ&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAf7un7fcbQxvoxAqxZlNuDgsFf_NltIXp3ji_LGDkXew&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myfitnesspal.com%2Fen&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="Image for the small product module"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image for the small product module" class="mx-auto my-0 size-full bg-white object-contain @xl/p:transition-transform @xl/p:duration-300 @xl/p:ease-in-out @xl/p:group-hover:scale-110 @xl/p:motion-reduce:group-hover:transition-none" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nc2W9wRDL3soRm.etzS9ww--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xMTk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/242a57d0-f222-11f0-beff-2ab13a255539" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="absolute -right-0.5 bottom-0 rounded-bl-none rounded-br-lg rounded-tl-lg rounded-tr-none bg-white/90 px-3 py-2 text-[10px]/3 text-battleship @xl/p:left-0 @xl/p:right-auto @xl/p:rounded-bl-lg @xl/p:rounded-br-none @xl/p:rounded-tl-none @xl/p:rounded-tr-lg"&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-desc mb-5 mt-2 space-y-6 text-base/relaxed md:text-lg/8 [&amp;amp;_li]:ml-4 [&amp;amp;_ol&amp;gt;li]:list-decimal [&amp;amp;_ol]:space-y-6 [&amp;amp;_ul&amp;gt;li]:list-disc [&amp;amp;_ul]:space-y-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MyFitnessPal is one of the most popular food-tracking apps today.

"I believe it has the most extensive database of food, and they have lots of great features that have evolved over time."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the best things about MyFitnessPal is that most of its key features are free to use. You'll be able to track food, water, exercise, and weight with the app's free plan, and it also offers goal and progress tracking, basic nutrition insights, and more. However, if you want to scan food barcodes or unlock the full nutrition insight panel, you'll have to upgrade to the Premium plan, which costs $79.99 a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768488917197;cpos:1;itmId:Download;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768488917197;pdid:MyFitnessPal;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:MyFitnessPal;pos:3;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;pkgt:horizontal-cta-1;slk:Download at MyFitnessPal;" class="peer clear-right box-border block w-full min-w-60 rounded-[40px] px-7 text-center hover:no-underline hover:opacity-100 active:opacity-60 @xl/p:w-9/12 rapid-with-clickid commerce-cta-btn-primary bg-article-ui-button py-3 font-semibold leading-5 text-article-ui-button-label hover:bg-article-ui-button-hover hover:text-grey-hair active:bg-article-ui-button-hover active:text-grey-hair peer-[&amp;amp;]:mt-3 dark:bg-white dark:text-batcave dark:hover:bg-bob dark:focus:bg-bob dark:active:bg-bob" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=514605a6-8316-49ff-8b3d-5f4fdf6a6af8&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=MyFitnessPal&amp;amp;merchantName=MyFitnessPal&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5teWZpdG5lc3NwYWwuY29tL2VuIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI5NzBhMjk1Ny02OTA1LTQzNjUtODhjNy05MWNkMzA2NmE0MTYiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15Zml0bmVzc3BhbC5jb20vZW4ifQ&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAf7un7fcbQxvoxAqxZlNuDgsFf_NltIXp3ji_LGDkXew&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.myfitnesspal.com%2Fen&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Download at MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-rmp"&gt;&lt;div id="f803708ec8dc417397da5db361ee979e"&gt;&lt;div class="commerce productModule [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:mt-9 [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-t [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-dirty-seagull [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:pt-2 [&amp;amp;+:not(.productModule)]:mt-10 col-body" id="product-module-f803708ec8dc417397da5db361ee979e"&gt;&lt;div class="mt-6 text-batcave @container/p dark:text-grey-hair"&gt;&lt;div class="block @xl/p:flex @xl/p:gap-6"&gt;&lt;div class="relative mb-4 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border border-grey-hair pb-[75%] @xl/p:mb-0 @xl/p:h-[165px] @xl/p:w-[220px] @xl/p:flex-none @xl/p:pb-0"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489039446;cpos:2;itmId:Download;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489039446;pdid:MeAgain;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:MeAgain;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;slk:Download at MeAgain;pkgt:horizontal-img;pos:1;" class="rapid-with-clickid group absolute size-full @xl/p:relative" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=MeAgain&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL21lYWdhaW4uYXBwLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTcwYTI5NTctNjkwNS00MzY1LTg4YzctOTFjZDMwNjZhNDE2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL21lYWdhaW4uYXBwLyJ9&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAUwfrK5wJXxBdCKNqFxvPVmALCCA94WTpwS2x2lbvq7K&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmeagain.app%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="Image for the small product module"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image for the small product module" class="mx-auto my-0 size-full bg-white object-contain @xl/p:transition-transform @xl/p:duration-300 @xl/p:ease-in-out @xl/p:group-hover:scale-110 @xl/p:motion-reduce:group-hover:transition-none" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6EIjD9Gy3dDchOVotFjveg--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xMTk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/77c25640-f222-11f0-9d75-78b65781be59" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="absolute -right-0.5 bottom-0 rounded-bl-none rounded-br-lg rounded-tl-lg rounded-tr-none bg-white/90 px-3 py-2 text-[10px]/3 text-battleship @xl/p:left-0 @xl/p:right-auto @xl/p:rounded-bl-lg @xl/p:rounded-br-none @xl/p:rounded-tl-none @xl/p:rounded-tr-lg"&gt;MeAgain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-desc mb-5 mt-2 space-y-6 text-base/relaxed md:text-lg/8 [&amp;amp;_li]:ml-4 [&amp;amp;_ol&amp;gt;li]:list-decimal [&amp;amp;_ol]:space-y-6 [&amp;amp;_ul&amp;gt;li]:list-disc [&amp;amp;_ul]:space-y-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're losing weight with the aid of a GLP-1 medication, MeAgain is another app to consider. "A new option that is great for GLP-1 users, but also anyone looking to lose weight, is Me Again," recommends Davis. "There's a bigger emphasis on fiber, protein, and water, rather than overall calories."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MeAgain offers food logging, weight tracking, exercise tracking, and more, but it also has special features like GLP-1 shot scheduling, side effect tracking, and more. The app is free to download, but it costs $17.99 per month to use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489039446;cpos:2;itmId:Download;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489039446;pdid:MeAgain;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:MeAgain;pos:3;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;pkgt:horizontal-cta-1;slk:Download at MeAgain;" class="peer clear-right box-border block w-full min-w-60 rounded-[40px] px-7 text-center hover:no-underline hover:opacity-100 active:opacity-60 @xl/p:w-9/12 rapid-with-clickid commerce-cta-btn-primary bg-article-ui-button py-3 font-semibold leading-5 text-article-ui-button-label hover:bg-article-ui-button-hover hover:text-grey-hair active:bg-article-ui-button-hover active:text-grey-hair peer-[&amp;amp;]:mt-3 dark:bg-white dark:text-batcave dark:hover:bg-bob dark:focus:bg-bob dark:active:bg-bob" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=MeAgain&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL21lYWdhaW4uYXBwLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTcwYTI5NTctNjkwNS00MzY1LTg4YzctOTFjZDMwNjZhNDE2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL21lYWdhaW4uYXBwLyJ9&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAUwfrK5wJXxBdCKNqFxvPVmALCCA94WTpwS2x2lbvq7K&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fmeagain.app%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Download at MeAgain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-rmp"&gt;&lt;div id="2c6704d0fc80455187884de790d4b629"&gt;&lt;div class="commerce productModule [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:mt-9 [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-t [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-dirty-seagull [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:pt-2 [&amp;amp;+:not(.productModule)]:mt-10 col-body" id="product-module-2c6704d0fc80455187884de790d4b629"&gt;&lt;div class="mt-6 text-batcave @container/p dark:text-grey-hair"&gt;&lt;div class="block @xl/p:flex @xl/p:gap-6"&gt;&lt;div class="relative mb-4 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border border-grey-hair pb-[75%] @xl/p:mb-0 @xl/p:h-[165px] @xl/p:w-[220px] @xl/p:flex-none @xl/p:pb-0"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489453069;cpos:3;itmId:Download;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489453069;pdid:MyNetDiary;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:MyNetDiary;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;slk:Download at MyNetDiary;pkgt:horizontal-img;pos:1;" class="rapid-with-clickid group absolute size-full @xl/p:relative" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=MyNetDiary&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5teW5ldGRpYXJ5LmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk3MGEyOTU3LTY5MDUtNDM2NS04OGM3LTkxY2QzMDY2YTQxNiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXluZXRkaWFyeS5jb20vIn0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAR30NTV2pVmsUopyXxGyLfDAC31r1gAJmueePVYMuCLW&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mynetdiary.com%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="Image for the small product module"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image for the small product module" class="mx-auto my-0 size-full bg-white object-contain @xl/p:transition-transform @xl/p:duration-300 @xl/p:ease-in-out @xl/p:group-hover:scale-110 @xl/p:motion-reduce:group-hover:transition-none" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0qWCZkDdx1cFY_EJ5V3QiQ--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xMTk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/6d6f8e50-f223-11f0-b5ed-ba31a003077f" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="absolute -right-0.5 bottom-0 rounded-bl-none rounded-br-lg rounded-tl-lg rounded-tr-none bg-white/90 px-3 py-2 text-[10px]/3 text-battleship @xl/p:left-0 @xl/p:right-auto @xl/p:rounded-bl-lg @xl/p:rounded-br-none @xl/p:rounded-tl-none @xl/p:rounded-tr-lg"&gt;MyNetDiary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-desc mb-5 mt-2 space-y-6 text-base/relaxed md:text-lg/8 [&amp;amp;_li]:ml-4 [&amp;amp;_ol&amp;gt;li]:list-decimal [&amp;amp;_ol]:space-y-6 [&amp;amp;_ul&amp;gt;li]:list-disc [&amp;amp;_ul]:space-y-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MyNetDiary is another dietitian-approved app for food tracking.

"It’s very user-friendly, has a large and reliable food database, and allows users to log meals with photos, which can feel much less mentally taxing than typing in every ingredient and measurement. It also allows you to sync your health data to it, as well, such as exercise."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is one of the more budget-friendly apps available, as well. It has a free version that offers basic food tracking, and the Premium version, which costs just $59.99 a year, gives you access to meal planning tools, advanced analytics, and integration with fitness trackers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489453069;cpos:3;itmId:Download;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489453069;pdid:MyNetDiary;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:MyNetDiary;pos:3;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;pkgt:horizontal-cta-1;slk:Download at MyNetDiary;" class="peer clear-right box-border block w-full min-w-60 rounded-[40px] px-7 text-center hover:no-underline hover:opacity-100 active:opacity-60 @xl/p:w-9/12 rapid-with-clickid commerce-cta-btn-primary bg-article-ui-button py-3 font-semibold leading-5 text-article-ui-button-label hover:bg-article-ui-button-hover hover:text-grey-hair active:bg-article-ui-button-hover active:text-grey-hair peer-[&amp;amp;]:mt-3 dark:bg-white dark:text-batcave dark:hover:bg-bob dark:focus:bg-bob dark:active:bg-bob" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=MyNetDiary&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5teW5ldGRpYXJ5LmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk3MGEyOTU3LTY5MDUtNDM2NS04OGM3LTkxY2QzMDY2YTQxNiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXluZXRkaWFyeS5jb20vIn0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAR30NTV2pVmsUopyXxGyLfDAC31r1gAJmueePVYMuCLW&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mynetdiary.com%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Download at MyNetDiary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-rmp"&gt;&lt;div id="7d6c6157da3740c588e22df27d3d9074"&gt;&lt;div class="commerce productModule [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:mt-9 [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-t [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-dirty-seagull [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:pt-2 [&amp;amp;+:not(.productModule)]:mt-10 col-body" id="product-module-7d6c6157da3740c588e22df27d3d9074"&gt;&lt;div class="mt-6 text-batcave @container/p dark:text-grey-hair"&gt;&lt;div class="block @xl/p:flex @xl/p:gap-6"&gt;&lt;div class="relative mb-4 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border border-grey-hair pb-[75%] @xl/p:mb-0 @xl/p:h-[165px] @xl/p:w-[220px] @xl/p:flex-none @xl/p:pb-0"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768490468690;cpos:4;itmId:Download;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768490468690;pdid:Nourish ;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:Nourish ;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;slk:Download at Nourish ;pkgt:horizontal-img;pos:1;" class="rapid-with-clickid group absolute size-full @xl/p:relative" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=Nourish+&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2Vub3VyaXNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk3MGEyOTU3LTY5MDUtNDM2NS04OGM3LTkxY2QzMDY2YTQxNiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudXNlbm91cmlzaC5jb20vIn0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAR1Hx_2MF6p8a3mXTvtw-RTaiYlydGeGcaQDjX9RinRT&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usenourish.com%2F&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="Image for the small product module"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image for the small product module" class="mx-auto my-0 size-full bg-white object-contain @xl/p:transition-transform @xl/p:duration-300 @xl/p:ease-in-out @xl/p:group-hover:scale-110 @xl/p:motion-reduce:group-hover:transition-none" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Wu7ql5ny4XohqyEWgX8rew--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xMTk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/a19c4450-f225-11f0-ba73-f949c41ff002" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="absolute -right-0.5 bottom-0 rounded-bl-none rounded-br-lg rounded-tl-lg rounded-tr-none bg-white/90 px-3 py-2 text-[10px]/3 text-battleship @xl/p:left-0 @xl/p:right-auto @xl/p:rounded-bl-lg @xl/p:rounded-br-none @xl/p:rounded-tl-none @xl/p:rounded-tr-lg"&gt;Nourish &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-desc mb-5 mt-2 space-y-6 text-base/relaxed md:text-lg/8 [&amp;amp;_li]:ml-4 [&amp;amp;_ol&amp;gt;li]:list-decimal [&amp;amp;_ol]:space-y-6 [&amp;amp;_ul&amp;gt;li]:list-disc [&amp;amp;_ul]:space-y-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your goal is to improve your diet, Nourish is another app to consider.

Within the app, you'll have access to daily lessons that help you understand your relationship with food, the science behind building (and breaking) habits, and how to create long-lasting healthy routines. I've personally used the app for weight loss, and I found the lessons incredibly helpful for long-term results. However, Noom is quite expensive, costing $179 for a six-month plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Noom has also recently launched a program called Noom Med, which offers access to prescription weight-loss medications, or GLP-1s. You'll be connected with a licensed clinician who will evaluate your health history to decide if the medication is right for your weight loss needs. These programs through Noom are more expensive, costing around $279 per month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489645659;cpos:5;itmId:Download;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768489645659;pdid:Noom;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:Noom;pos:3;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;pkgt:horizontal-cta-1;slk:Download at Noom;" class="peer clear-right box-border block w-full min-w-60 rounded-[40px] px-7 text-center hover:no-underline hover:opacity-100 active:opacity-60 @xl/p:w-9/12 rapid-with-clickid commerce-cta-btn-primary bg-article-ui-button py-3 font-semibold leading-5 text-article-ui-button-label hover:bg-article-ui-button-hover hover:text-grey-hair active:bg-article-ui-button-hover active:text-grey-hair peer-[&amp;amp;]:mt-3 dark:bg-white dark:text-batcave dark:hover:bg-bob dark:focus:bg-bob dark:active:bg-bob" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4d1500cc-635c-421e-a09f-197b90d925bf&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=Noom&amp;amp;merchantName=Noom&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub29tLmNvbSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOTcwYTI5NTctNjkwNS00MzY1LTg4YzctOTFjZDMwNjZhNDE2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub29tLmNvbSJ9&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAftcDUY7P9CrgbIIp3LmDhai1yOxYcP-Mm_LLoVEnobi&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.noom.com&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Download at Noom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-rmp"&gt;&lt;div id="54bcd36f33a942db8392a4a1116b2826"&gt;&lt;div class="commerce productModule [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:mt-9 [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-t [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:border-dirty-seagull [&amp;amp;+.productModule]:pt-2 [&amp;amp;+:not(.productModule)]:mt-10 col-body" id="product-module-54bcd36f33a942db8392a4a1116b2826"&gt;&lt;div class="mt-6 text-batcave @container/p dark:text-grey-hair"&gt;&lt;div class="block @xl/p:flex @xl/p:gap-6"&gt;&lt;div class="relative mb-4 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-lg border border-grey-hair pb-[75%] @xl/p:mb-0 @xl/p:h-[165px] @xl/p:w-[220px] @xl/p:flex-none @xl/p:pb-0"&gt;&lt;a data-ylk="aid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768490057126;cpos:6;itmId:Download ;ll3:product-available;ll4:additionalbtn-manual;pid:manual_970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416_1768490057126;pdid:Weight Watchers;subsec:commlist;elmt:chooseForMe;sellerN:Weight Watchers;sec:small-product;elm:affiliate_link;itc:0;slk:Download  at Weight Watchers;pkgt:horizontal-img;pos:1;" class="rapid-with-clickid group absolute size-full @xl/p:relative" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=468ae44d-0b5e-499d-b1bf-6d656c3f9447&amp;amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;amp;pageId=pnr-product-module&amp;amp;contentUuid=970a2957-6905-4365-88c7-91cd3066a416&amp;amp;featureId=manual-entry&amp;amp;itemName=Weight+Watchers&amp;amp;merchantName=WW+International&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZWlnaHR3YXRjaGVycy5jb20vdXMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6Ijk3MGEyOTU3LTY5MDUtNDM2NS04OGM3LTkxY2QzMDY2YTQxNiIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2VpZ2h0d2F0Y2hlcnMuY29tL3VzIn0&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAe6UdDeQ8PLharZXyzFrWIapwRRux8UDh7al2lvnG8FP&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weightwatchers.com%2Fus&amp;amp;spaceId=1197803370" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" aria-label="Image for the small product module"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image for the small product module" class="mx-auto my-0 size-full bg-white object-contain @xl/p:transition-transform @xl/p:duration-300 @xl/p:ease-in-out @xl/p:group-hover:scale-110 @xl/p:motion-reduce:group-hover:transition-none" src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z9w3GbGImK_KcoBXrk90Yw--~B/aD05MDA7dz0xMTk2O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/d4cd1580-f224-11f0-b7e6-ad71bb2385ba" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="absolute -right-0.5 bottom-0 rounded-bl-none rounded-br-lg rounded-tl-lg rounded-tr-none bg-white/90 px-3 py-2 text-[10px]/3 text-battleship @xl/p:left-0 @xl/p:right-auto @xl/p:rounded-bl-lg @xl/p:rounded-br-none @xl/p:rounded-tl-none @xl/p:rounded-tr-lg"&gt;Weight Watchers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="commerce-desc mb-5 mt-2 space-y-6 text-base/relaxed md:text-lg/8 [&amp;amp;_li]:ml-4 [&amp;amp;_ol&amp;gt;li]:list-decimal [&amp;amp;_ol]:space-y-6 [&amp;amp;_ul&amp;gt;li]:list-disc [&amp;amp;_ul]:space-y-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight Watchers has been around for many years, and it's best known for its Points Program, which is used as an alternative to calorie counting.

				&lt;p&gt;A $6.2 million tech-forward rehab facility opened Thursday at Allegheny Valley Hospital in Harrison, making it the only stroke and surgery recovery center of its kind in the region, according to Allegheny Health Network officials.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“This is equipment that few centers have,” said Dr. Mark Rubino, the hospital’s president.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The innovation promotes both physical and mental healing, he said, readying patients to reembrace life.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Therapy boards that test cognition and mobility sit alongside specialized treadmills equipped with harnesses to help maintain a patient’s balance.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;A large room holds other futuristic-looking equipment, including virtual reality goggles to challenge a patient’s balance and attention. Videos can simulate everyday functions, such as grocery shopping or laundry, which require patients to bend or reach.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The expansion increases inpatient rehab space by 70%, from 17 to 29 beds, and establishes Allegheny Valley Hospital as the health network’s central rehab hub for people recovering from injuries, surgery and serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“This is a critical investment for health and wellness in Allegheny County,” county Executive Sara Innamorato said.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“All of this technology restores confidence and allows people to move forward more quickly with their recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Innamorato joined state Sen. Lindsey Williams and Harrison Commissioner Justin Johnson for the celebratory opening.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;AHN Hospitals President Lou Baverso said the expansion will benefit an aging population and address rising rates of chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Last year, more than 300 rehab patients were treated in Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Hospitals across the U.S. are experiencing a shortage of rehab beds, according to UCLA Health research published in February in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Locally, Independence Health System closed its inpatient rehab at Latrobe Hospital in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;But Rubino said it’s more than just adding beds.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The increased capacity impacts clinical care by streamlining AHN’s rehab program, sending patients to Harrison from Forbes Hospital in Monroeville, which closed its rehab unit Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The move brought an additional 40 employees to Allegheny Valley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Forbes, meanwhile, will convert its former rehab space into 20 new medical-surgical beds to meet the demand for acute care and improve patient flow in its emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Rubino said AHN’s regional approach helps keep patients in a community setting and allows families to more actively participate in their care.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“This recognizes that recovery is not only physical but emotional,” said Williams, whose district covers Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;She was excited about the commitment to the Alle-Kiski Valley, saying it helps bring the local hospital to its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“Families are thankful for not forgetting us up here in Natrona Heights,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;The AVH rehab center touts unique equipment designed for physical as well as psychological recovery, Rubino said.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;An example is that harness that supports a patient’s weight while they learn to walk, which in turn promotes activity in an earlier stage of recovery and spurs confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Other equipment includes electrical stimulation for upper and lower extremities, cognitive and driving assessment tools, and innovative speech and swallowing therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“This is a great investment for the Alle-Kiski Valley,” Johnson said. “The community needs to be aware that this is not the same hospital they saw when they were young.”&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;AHN received $300,000 toward construction from the Alle-Kiski Medical Center Trust, a nonprofit focused on health care initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;Robin Bergstrom, former Harrison commissioner and current trust chair, said her board routinely debates the value of donation requests to determine whether they align with the Trust’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;“This was a unanimous yes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
									&lt;/div&gt;

Why is your &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/gut-health-guide-2"&gt;gut important&lt;/a&gt;?

When that ecosystem is nourished with a diverse range of plants, we see better metabolic health, lower chronic &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-follow-the-anti-inflammatory-diet-without-it-taking-over-your-life"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and healthier aging; but when it’s fed high-risk &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/these-processed-foods-are-secretly-sabotaging-your-diet"&gt;processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and hardly any fiber, we see the opposite.” Vegetable brine is an underrated gut hero. “The salty, tangy liquid your kimchi sits in is packed with live microbes and postbiotic metabolites,” says Dr. Drain. “Sip it, whisk into dressings, chase an oyster with it—or even cook with it. Truly liquid gold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13.

The brain is not clearer, it is reacting to stress,” says Clark. “This causes us to experience an increased focus, nervousness, and the euphoria that people often mistake for clarity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. … and it’s probably too soon to commit to 5 p.m. dinners for the rest of your life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutritional therapist Sanniti notes that our knowledge of &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/intermittent-fasting-calories"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; is “constantly evolving.” In fact, a 2025 study of 19,000 people found that adults who eat only within an eight-hour window face a 135% higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease. While the jury is out on the reason for the link, there’s enough there to stop us pledging allegiance to the 5p.m. dinner forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. Man cannot survive on flame-seared tomahawk steaks alone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Out in the wilderness, shirtless influencer bros are communing with their inner caveman, grilling tomahawk steaks over open flames like it’s the Palaeolithic content era,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.instagram.com/theleglesslamb/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.instagram.com/theleglesslamb/"}' href="https://www.instagram.com/theleglesslamb/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bodean Hammett&lt;/a&gt;, a chef based in Yorkshire who knows his way around an open flame. The appeal for viewers is pure primal theater: smoke, fire, and the illusion of rugged self-sufficiency. But is it healthy? “Daily tomahawks move the needle in the wrong direction,” says military fitness coach Farren Morgan. “Open flame can be fine, but heavily burnt meat and fat create harmful compounds that are known to increase the risk of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. The boozy 10 p.m. dinners are just as bad as you think.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ‘three-hour rule’ advises finishing your last meal at least three hours before bedtime, in line with your body’s &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-key-to-better-sleep-is-going-outside-in-the-morning"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;,” explains nutritionist &lt;a data-offer-url="https://balancerehabclinic.com/team/indhira-ghyssaert/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://balancerehabclinic.com/team/indhira-ghyssaert/"}' href="https://balancerehabclinic.com/team/indhira-ghyssaert/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Indhira Ghyssaert&lt;/a&gt;. “This internal clock optimizes digestion, metabolism and sleep during daylight hours. Eating closer to lights-out disrupts this, spiking blood sugar, promoting fat storage, and elevating hunger levels the next morning. If eating late is unavoidable, keep it light: 200–300 calories max.” As for &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/is-alcohol-bad-for-you"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, the World Health Organization last year ended the party in a more definitive way, stating that “there is no safe amount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17.

Yes, amino acid content and lean fat percentage are important if you’re trying to tone up, but don’t be that guy. “You don’t need to obsess over amino acid charts or fat percentages when shopping,” says Steve Bennett, health coach and author of &lt;em&gt;The Primal Cure: Avoid Being a Sick Statistic&lt;/em&gt;. “If a food came from something that once had a face, it already contains complete &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-much-protein-do-you-actually-need"&gt;proteins&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of studying labels, stick to simple rules: choose foods with few ingredients, avoid unpronounceable additives, and watch for &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-to-reduce-sugar-intake-2"&gt;hidden sugars&lt;/a&gt; ending in ‘-ose’. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. But you really do need to start paying attention to Ultra-processed foods.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/these-processed-foods-are-secretly-sabotaging-your-diet-1"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; get a bad rap for a very good reason. “Diets high in UPFs are consistently linked to cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes,” says Whitaker, the dietitian. “They [can] promote oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, both of which promote tumor growth.” A study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Jama Oncology&lt;/em&gt; also found that women eating an average of 9.9 servings of UPFs a day had a significantly greater risk of precancerous polyps in the colon. While some processed foods, such as yogurt, are not going to kill you, be wary of any seemingly healthy food that’s been loaded with additives. &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-protein-powder-muscle-gain"&gt;Protein powders&lt;/a&gt; are often considered UPFs and some have even &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/which-type-of-protein-powder-has-the-least-lead-1"&gt;been found to contain harmful metals&lt;/a&gt;—so it’s best to proceed with moderation there as well. Whitaker puts it simply: “Focus on whole or minimally processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. Stop pounding the shakes and eat a real meal every once in a while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longevity medicine physician &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dralkapatel.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dralkapatel.com/"}' href="https://www.dralkapatel.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Alka Patel&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t buy the idea of surviving wholly on meal replacement shakes. “You might not die, but your &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-drinks-for-gut-health-4"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; might,” she warns. “[Meal replacement] shakes can cover basic vitamins and macros but those trillions of microbes depend on fiber diversity, plant compounds and texture to regulate digestion, immunity and more. Take that away, and key species disappear, leading to nutrient gaps, muscle loss, hormonal disruption, and slower metabolism.” Your body is built for variety, not endless sludge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20.

(WLOS) — &lt;/span&gt;Two new cases of measles have been confirmed in unvaccinated siblings in Buncombe County, according to local officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two affected individuals are preschool- and school-age children, one of whom attends Asheville-Pisgah Christian School, which has a 41% vaccination rate for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings the total number of measles cases in North Carolina to seven since late December, with five of those in Buncombe County, per a press release from the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two affected children are in isolation and public health officials are conducting contact tracing, the county said. School administrators are notifying parents and guardians about the potential exposure, while public health staff are reaching out to those who may have been exposed to provide guidance on reducing further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/buncombe-county-measles-vaccination-rates-outbreak-risk-north-carolina-department-health-human-services-dashboard" target="_blank"&gt;OFFICIALS: BUNCOMBE COUNTY'S HIGHER EXEMPTION RATES FOR MEASLES VACCINE PUT AREA AT RISK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Measles is one of the most contagious diseases we encounter, but it is also highly preventable," said Dr. Ellis Matheson, public health director for Buncombe County, via a press release. "Our team is working quickly to identify exposed individuals, ensure appropriate follow-up, and protect our community. Vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles and its potentially serious complications."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak in the Upstate region of South Carolina, where at least 124 new measles cases have been reported since last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/124-new-measles-cases-reported-south-carolina-upstate-spartanburg-outbreak-spreads-department-public-health-infection-mmr-vaccine-contagious-disease-virus" target="_blank"&gt;124 NEW MEASLES CASES REPORTED IN SOUTH CAROLINA AS OUTBREAK SPREADS: HEALTH OFFICIALS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through direct contact and the air, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. The virus can survive in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure and can include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, tiny white spots inside the mouth, and a rash. Anyone who shows symptoms is advised to contact their local health department, limit exposure to others and call ahead before visiting a medical office, clinic or hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge everyone aged one year or older to receive the  measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; more than 2,000 confirmed measles cases across the country. Of these, 93% of those infected were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCDHHS has launched a new &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/programs/epidemiology/communicable-disease/infectious-respiratory-diseases/measles-rubeola/measles-cases-and-outbreaks-north-carolina?mc_cid=ea05c7dbf5&amp;amp;mc_eid=22def7855c" target="_blank"&gt;Measles Cases and Outbreaks Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that will be updated two times a week with new case and exposure information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:15:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxPMVpPRUZhZUZwM0Jna0lPMDUwcGo3RVdjRkRELVZZZDI4b1hrSmZSRVAxTUVnZ0c3empZbVAyUmtMZUwzYlRpUnZTVkJrLXFFeGZUTHJLcmtaaFhWQ0dxdHkzemJwTXZsXzNvaENDR2dBek9UcW9TLU13QmdQZWw0TVhFN0haWF9Ud0p6X2paVGtsWURPdk5xZ21sS0FUdk44eldhaE9pRUNmWFQ3MW1ySU1ramtGc0p6YllUN2V4UXJYdGZhUXlmeFpENWV5SzVrWVlhenZCYTRZM0JhMm5tQ0VuTktIdUdtcVhXaU1XWkZWNHRkOVRaNkltVQ</guid></item><item><title>FDA要求赛诺菲、葛兰素史克、亚利桑那州和CSL在流感疫苗标签上加入发热性癫痫发作的警告- Fierce Pharma</title><link>https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/fda-tells-sanofi-gsk-az-and-csl-include-warning-childhood-seizures-flu-shots</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col content"&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The FDA has told the makers of six flu vaccines that they need to add a notification to the label of their shots, warning of the risk of febrile seizures, which can occur after childhood vaccinations and typically last no more than a few minutes and are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/febrile-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20372522"&gt;generally harmless&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA sent the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/2026-safety-and-availability-communications"&gt;notifications&lt;/a&gt; to Sanofi, AstraZeneca, GSK and CSL Seqirus earlier this month. Each of the six vaccines has been on the market in the U.S. for at least 13 years, including Sanofi’s Fluzone, which was blessed by the agency in 1980. Other shots cited in the letters, which were sent on January 9, were AZ’s FluMist, GSK’s Fluarix and FluLaval, and CSL’s Afluria and Flucelvax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://www.fda.gov/media/190541/download?attachment"&gt;notices&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) to the companies, the FDA wrote that two postmarketing observational studies conducted by the FDA's &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/cber-biologics-effectiveness-and-safety-best-system"&gt;Biologics Effectiveness and Safety System (BEST)&lt;/a&gt; revealed an increased risk of febrile seizures on the first day following vaccination in children aged 6 months to 4 years.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p class="ad-container"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;The flu shots were assessed over two flu seasons, from 2023 to 2025, using three commercial insurance claim data sources, the U.S. regulator told the companies. Among children ages 6 months to 4 years, the risk of febrile seizures within a window of 0 to 1 days after vaccination was compared to the risk within a control window of 8 to 63 days after vaccination, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA did not include full data in the notifications, but did say that information from one data partner indicated an estimated risk of 21 febrile seizure episodes for every 1 million quadrivalent vaccinations. For trivalent vaccinations from the same data partner, the estimated rate was 44 seizures for every 1 million shots, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Sanofi said that of the billions of doses of Fluzone that have been administered, febrile seizures have occurred in a “limited subset of patients.” The company already includes information on febrile seizures in its current prescribing information for the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;dynamic-ad-slot :pos="11" placeholder-id="ad-slot-2_mobile" ad-id="adSlot2Mobile" :hide-on-desktop="1" :hide-on-mobile="0" :container-size-map="[[1,1]]" :sizes="[[300, 250],[320,50]]"&gt;&lt;/dynamic-ad-slot&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;“Sanofi maintains an ongoing commitment to robust safety surveillance and effectiveness monitoring, informed by clinical and postmarketing data,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. “The existing data continue to support the established safety and efficacy profile of Fluzone SD.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A GSK spokesperson said that the company is reviewing the FDA's label update request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our top priority is patient safety,"  the spokesperson added. "We are committed to monitoring and ensuring the safety of all our products, including our seasonal influenza vaccines, and we are confident in their safety and efficacy profile."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA wants companies to use the following language on their labels: “In two separate postmarketing observational studies, an increased risk of febrile seizures was observed during the first day following vaccination with standard dose trivalent (2024-2025) and quadrivalent (2023-2024) influenza vaccines in children 6 months through 4 years of age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10" class="olytics_injection"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The FDA has given the companies 30 days to agree to include the suggested label update, propose changes to the notice, or submit a rebuttal explaining why a change is not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cdc-acts-presidential-memorandum-update-childhood-immunization-schedule.html"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; broad recommendations for flu shots for children in a sweeping move in which the U.S. health agency &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/rfk-jr-whacks-6-vaccines-cdcs-childhood-recommendation-list" target="_blank"&gt;upended&lt;/a&gt; the childhood immunization schedule, also eliminating recommendations for other vaccines that protect them from diseases including COVID-19, rotavirus, meningitis, hepatitis A and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, immunization against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)—the top cause for infant hospitalizations in the U.S., according to the CDC—is now limited to those at high risk and children whose mothers have not been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vaccines have been under heightened scrutiny since Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, took over at the Department of Health and Human Services. Last year, RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/rfk-jr-hhs-oust-entire-roster-cdc-vaccine-expert-committee" target="_blank"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; all 17 former experts on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replaced them with his own selections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanofi's spokesperson warned that flu can pose “significant health risks, particularly for young children under 5 and individuals with specific pre-existing health conditions.” The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual flu vaccination for all pediatric patients aged 6 months and older who do not have a contraindication, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease experts have &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/vaccines/119434"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that opting out of a universal recommendation for childhood flu shots could endanger those who are at a higher risk of complications. &lt;/p&gt;

There's no way in one year I've developed five tumors," she told Business Insider. "That's not possible. And I didn't feel it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the diagnosis, Hwang told Business Insider she had no symptoms, and no reason to think she was at risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;She was healthy, played tennis daily, and balanced her busy career with parenting three sons as a single mom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis — in January 2024, when Hwang was 46 — felt like a spiral of bad news, as she learned treatment would be much more involved than she hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After multiple surgeries, including bilateral mastectomies, chemotherapy, radiation, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/breast-cancer-treatment-delay-having-kids-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt;, Hwang is in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now 48, she's poised to publish her new memoir "From Both Sides of the Curtain: Lessons and Reflections from an Oncologist's Breast Cancer Journey," available January 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a patient prompted her to embrace vulnerability and made her a better doctor along the way, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being more open to others about my struggles, helped me heal because I realized I'm not alone. Everyone is struggling, and by admitting it, it makes you more human. Patients were able to relate to me a lot better," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5891cb92-4e46-448c-90f5-a788080b2d0f" data-toc-id="5891cb92-4e46-448c-90f5-a788080b2d0f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From doctor to patient&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hwang said her first response to the diagnosis was fear about breaking the news to her three sons — then ages 15, 13, and 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was just thinking about my kids and 'Oh my God, what's going to happen if this kills me?'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of her patients, Hwang knew what to expect from treatment and how to make sense of her prognosis. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/more-young-women-getting-breast-cancer-two-potential-reasons-2024-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Breast cancer cases&lt;/a&gt; are on the rise, but it is a very treatable disease, particularly if caught early.

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Follow-up imaging showed Hwang's cancer was more extensive than expected. Her doctors, who were also her friends and colleagues, gave her a survival rate of 85%. In the abstract, it's an encouraging number. But all Hwang could think about was the 15% chance that something would go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a great number, but I heard that number, and I think that was the first time I actually just full-on lost it in a doctor's office," she said. "I'm doing all of this and you're only going to give me a B. That was how I looked at it as a patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="fef69ece-4a9f-4d40-8b79-cdb643c2c1b5" data-toc-id="fef69ece-4a9f-4d40-8b79-cdb643c2c1b5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lingering cost of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the anxiety and side effects of treatment, Hwang said the biggest challenge has been coming to terms with her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/true-cost-young-colon-cancer-crisis-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;identity as a cancer survivor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had hoped to return to life as usual. Her work as a doctor was about treating the disease, but nothing in her training had prepared her for how things would change after her own diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are physically not the same person. By the time I was done with treatment, my breasts were gone, my ovaries were gone, my uterus was gone, my hair was gone and it's a huge emotional toll," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hwang said she's still figuring out what her new role as a survivor means for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the diagnosis, Hwang said she took pride in keeping her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/for-28-years-i-didnt-tell-anyone-i-had-cancer-2022-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;personal struggles private&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People would say 'I don't know how you do it,' and I would let them think I had it all together," Hwang said. "I never told people sometimes it sucks, I get home, and I'm exhausted, I want to cry because it's so lonely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started talking about her struggles, and asking her patients for advice: on how they recovered, and how they came to terms with the major changes to their bodies and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, her strategy has been working less, focusing more on her family, and prioritizing her health in the face of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, she hopes that sharing her experience can offer support to patients and someday push the healthcare industry to provide more structure after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I really want people to know they're not alone," Hwang said. "It's okay to not know. It's okay to be scared. It's okay to have anxiety. This is just the nature of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that the MIND diet is particularly effective at lowering the risk of conditions such as dementia, stroke, depression, and anxiety. These findings were published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103616" target="_blank"&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurological and psychiatric disorders represent a leading cause of disability worldwide. As the global population ages, the burden of these conditions continues to grow. Doctors currently possess few curative options for diseases like dementia. This reality makes prevention a primary goal for public health officials. Prior research has identified links between nutrition and individual health outcomes. However, previous studies often examined single dietary patterns or single diseases in isolation. This fragmented approach has left gaps in understanding how different diets compare directly against one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers sought to address these knowledge gaps. They wanted to determine which dietary patterns offer the most comprehensive benefits for the brain. The investigation was led by Yisen Shi, Yixiang Lin, and Yiling Zheng from Fujian Medical University Union Hospital in China. They aimed to create a holistic picture of the connection between food and neurological health. Their team also sought to uncover the specific biological mechanisms that explain why certain foods help or harm the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the UK Biobank to conduct their investigation. This is a massive biomedical database containing health information from residents of the United Kingdom. The study included nearly 170,000 participants. These individuals were between the ages of 37 and 73. None of the selected participants had a diagnosis of a brain disorder at the start of the study. The research team tracked the health of these individuals for a median period of roughly ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated ten different healthy eating scores. These included well-known regimens like the Mediterranean diet and the DASH diet. They also assessed the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, or MIND diet. In addition to healthy patterns, they calculated the intake of ultra-processed foods. These are industrial food products that typically contain additives, preservatives, and artificial flavorings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used statistical models to compare these diets against the incidence of five major disorders. These disorders were dementia, Parkinson’s disease, stroke, depression, and anxiety. The analysis revealed that the MIND diet offered the broadest neuroprotective effects. This eating pattern combines elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets. It specifically emphasizes green leafy vegetables, berries, nuts, whole grains, and fish. It also advises limiting butter, cheese, and red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who adhered closely to the MIND diet saw significant benefits. The data showed a reduced likelihood of developing dementia. The risk of suffering a stroke was also lower in this group. Mental health outcomes were similarly positive. High adherence to the MIND diet correlated with lower risks for both depression and anxiety. The study did not find a significant link between the MIND diet and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results for ultra-processed foods were starkly different. High consumption of these foods was associated with negative health outcomes. The analysis linked processed food intake to an increased risk of dementia. It also showed a correlation with higher risks for depression and anxiety. Unlike the healthy dietary patterns, high consumption of ultra-processed foods was also linked to a greater risk of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sought to confirm these findings in other populations. They utilized data from two independent groups. These were the U.S. Health and Retirement Study and the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. This validation step ensures that the results are not specific to just one region or culture. The protective associations of the MIND diet held true in these diverse cohorts. The diet was linked to better cognitive performance and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety in both the American and Chinese groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key innovation of this study was its focus on biological mechanisms. The researchers wanted to understand how diet physically alters the body to protect the brain. They analyzed blood samples and brain imaging data from a subset of the participants. They looked at biomarkers related to metabolism, inflammation, and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests the MIND diet works through several specific pathways. One major pathway involves metabolism. The diet appears to improve the body’s lipid profile. This includes how the body processes cholesterol and triglycerides. A favorable metabolic signature explained a large proportion of the reduced risk for stroke. It also accounted for a significant part of the reduction in depression and anxiety risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pathway involves the biological aging process. The researchers measured markers that indicate how fast the body’s cells are aging relative to chronological age. Adherence to the MIND diet was associated with slower biological aging. This deceleration in aging appeared to be the primary way the diet reduces the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body composition played a role as well. The MIND diet was linked to a lower Body Mass Index. This reduction in obesity contributed to the lowered risk of depression and anxiety. The diet also seemed to reduce chronic inflammation in the body. Lower inflammation levels are generally associated with better long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging provided physical evidence of these benefits. The researchers examined magnetic resonance imaging scans. They found that people who followed the MIND diet had preserved brain volume in key areas. These areas included the pallidum and the thalamus. These brain structures are essential for processing sensory information and regulating emotions. High intake of ultra-processed foods was linked to reduced volume in these same areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also performed a detailed analysis of proteins in the blood. This technique is known as proteomics. They identified specific proteins that act as mediators between diet and disease. One protein called GDF-15 was highlighted. Changes in levels of this protein helped explain the link between processed foods and depression. The analysis indicated that these proteins are involved in immune responses and metabolic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also utilized a technique called Mendelian randomization. This method uses genetic data to infer potential causal relationships. The results supported the idea that the diet’s metabolic effects directly influence aging and obesity markers. This strengthens the argument that the diet causes the health improvements rather than just being associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to this research. It is primarily an observational study. This design can identify strong associations but cannot definitively prove cause and effect. Participants reported their own dietary intake through questionnaires. Self-reported data is subject to memory errors and may not capture long-term changes in eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study population in the UK Biobank is predominantly of European descent. While the validation cohorts included American and Chinese participants, the results may not apply perfectly to every global population. The researchers attempted to adjust for lifestyle factors like smoking and exercise. However, residual factors could still influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is necessary to confirm these findings. The authors suggest that randomized controlled trials are the next logical step. Such trials would assign participants to specific diets and monitor their health over time. This would provide more definitive evidence of the biological pathways involved. Researchers should also investigate how these dietary changes affect brain health at different stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides a detailed roadmap of how food impacts the brain. It highlights the MIND diet as a promising strategy for reducing the burden of neurological and psychiatric disorders. It also identifies ultra-processed foods as a significant modifiable risk factor. The findings offer potential targets for future medical interventions and public health guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103616" target="_blank"&gt;Association between different dietary patterns and the risk of major brain disorders: a prospective multi-cohort study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yisen Shi, Yixiang Lin, Yiling Zheng, Xinxi Yu, Binfan Ou, Kaitai Yang, Fabin Lin, Xinyang Zou, Jiayi Zheng, Ruitian Zeng, Xuan Lin, Qinyong Ye, Lina Chen, Yuqi Zeng, and Guoen Cai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:01:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOV3hmNzZkc2ExVVBaVy1PSE5GSm4zUmt3R3ZxZktvamF6c1dESnJvdUZRZ3c1a08ybGdHNDdtSkRVWWEyaXFydDlPUVJUZkltdGpiTDJnYVkxZktWM0F3ZUk5TW51eTBNZnd5cFBXUS1LZ3NyNDFNdVJ3WXdWU2lIZHJQUGZyUFF0bXNNUA</guid></item><item><title>一则关于祖父母亲吻新生儿的病毒性抖音引起了轩然大波。医生称体重- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kissing-newborn-baby-tiktok-doctors-experts_l_6967e4f3e4b0da4905d32d2e</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A first-time mom’s lighthearted TikTok video demonstrating her decision not to allow close relatives to kiss her newborn sparked a major debate online. But doctors and pediatric infectious disease experts say the mom spurred an important conversation — and there are serious health risks everyone should consider when visiting a new baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haeli Christiansen &lt;a href="https://people.com/first-time-parent-slaps-her-mom-to-remind-her-not-to-kiss-her-baby-exclusive-11884425" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="told People magazine" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6967e4f3e4b0da4905d32d2e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://people.com/first-time-parent-slaps-her-mom-to-remind-her-not-to-kiss-her-baby-exclusive-11884425" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;told People magazine&lt;/a&gt; in an article published Tuesday that she did not expect her post with her mom to go viral.

But when her mom, who is seated while holding the baby, leans in to similarly kiss the baby, Christiansen taps her mom on the head to stop her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gently reminding my mom to not kiss my newborn,” she wrote in the text overlay of the video. In the caption of the post she wrote with a laughing-face emoji: “The word of the day is ‘boundaries.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christiansen explained to People that the video was made in good fun, and that her mom had actually advised her not to let anyone kiss her newborn. Christiansen told the publication that she was hospitalized twice as a baby due to family members kissing her without realizing they were sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My husband and I made the decision to not have extended family or friends kiss our newborn for the first few months after birth because he was born in the middle of ‘sick season’ and newborns don’t have an immune system,” she said. “A common cold for adults could land a newborn in the hospital and be a life-threatening situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christiansen told People that she was “shocked” her video spurred such a debate online. Her TikTok post garnered over 730,000 “likes” with nearly 4,000 comments. While many commenters agreed with Christiansen’s boundaries on whom she allows to kiss her newborn, others criticized her for preventing her mom from kissing her son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sad, poor grandma,” one commenter wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will never deny my child genuine love,” another commenter wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would never do that to my mom,” wrote another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While parents are entitled to make their own decisions about the boundaries they set with relatives visiting their newborns, we spoke to pediatricians and pediatric infectious disease specialists who warned about the potential health risks associated with people kissing babies — especially on the face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Westend61 via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Westend61 via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Pediatricians and pediatric infectious disease specialists warned about the potential health risks associated with people kissing newborns.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can spread a virus to a newborn before realizing you’re sick. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, it’s important to remember that the goal when visiting newborns is to “minimize risk of infection as much as possible,” emphasized &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=49832" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Taylor Heald-Sargent" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6967e4f3e4b0da4905d32d2e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=49832" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Dr. Taylor Heald-Sargent&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at Ann &amp;amp; Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to keep in mind that newborn babies’ immune systems are very immature,” she told HuffPost. “They are not functioning like an older child, even a few months older, or an adult. So what might be a mild infection for an older child or an adult can land the baby in the intensive care unit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m thinking about infections like RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] and pertussis (whooping cough). Those are ones that we really, really need to do our best to protect our youngest members of society,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/rsv-respiratory-syncytial-virus" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="RSV is a respiratory infection" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6967e4f3e4b0da4905d32d2e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/rsv-respiratory-syncytial-virus" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;RSV is a respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt; caused by a virus.

There are many ways to show love to new parents and newborns that do not involve close physical contact. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playforth explained that babies are at the highest risk of facing severe outcomes from infections in the first two to three months of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then the risk decreases gradually as baby develops a more robust immune system,” she said. “During respiratory season, especially this year, I think it makes a lot of sense to minimize close contact and kissing even beyond the first two to three months, or to limit it to trusted caregivers who are healthy and up to date on their immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Babies do not need to be kissed to know they are loved,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heald-Sargent added that it’s important to note that when you kiss a newborn on their face, you are getting closer to where the virus would enter the body, therefore increasing the risk of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;It's best for parents and caregivers to communicate their boundaries and expectations before relatives or friends visit a newborn.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are ways parents of newborns can navigate potentially uncomfortable conversations about their boundaries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playforth, Heald-Sargent and Edwards all agree that it’s best to communicate your boundaries and expectations &lt;em&gt;before &lt;/em&gt;your relatives or friends visit your newborn — and to frame conversations in a way that emphasizes that you and your loved ones share one common goal: to keep baby safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heald-Sargent said that, as a parent herself, when her baby was born during flu season, she sent a letter to close family and friends explaining all of her preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone rolled their eyes because they know me,” she said with a laugh. “But that was my way of not having the same conversation 10 times.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Heald-Sargent said her advice to parents is to approach conversations about their boundaries with their close family and friends from a place that reminds them they all share a love for the baby and “a desire to keep the baby safe and healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as it relates to the criticism Christiansen received on TikTok that she was preventing her mom the opportunity to bond with her son, Heald-Sargent would emphasize to all families that “there’s lots of ways that you can bond.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can also remind people back to the pandemic days when we all were very isolated and there were still lots of bonding moments that went on — even during social distancing,” she said. “I remember babies picking up on facial cues around the mask; it was incredible.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playforth said it could be helpful to emphasize that your boundaries surrounding loved ones kissing your baby might be temporary and that it’s medical-related. You can even blame your pediatrician. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are struggling, blame your pediatrician. I promise we don’t mind!” she said. “Remember that your job is to protect your baby, not to manage other adults’ feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playforth said that even though Christiansen’s video was lighthearted, it “touches on a very real and important issue” and that “setting boundaries around a newborn’s health is not disrespectful.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is responsible parenting, and I actually appreciate that the video helps make these conversations (and conflicts) more visible,” she said. “So many parents struggle with this quietly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pushback the creator received highlights how deeply ingrained society’s expectation is about who should have access to a baby, and the extent to which a new parent should bow down to expectations,” she continued, before adding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parental boundaries are about safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:57:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNelpLaDlvd0pGR2pyQTBaZVAxU3k2Q1BmQmZFMTVGZXVDeGpLMndtSEk3RjZmdzYzQ2RwdkpiWFhpcUpWYVBOSGxlQzhSZDhOT0d3cW5aNnAtT2c5V0hHbUZDTlFBQmUzRjU4X2JPb09KWkhIaVM3dldWQ1hMT25fUXVIc1YwMGItMnNNUzQ2V0t4WkxvSTJOTHpSTlN4TXk5dlFJ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1ZblNSWk5xaTRIREpWaEs2TW9PUVBpV3JwSzNQa1V1Si1XUGFieC1mNGl0YTlhaWtoRWYzdnpXYUpsbXVpZ0x6U2JWR0hjSWhRdWoxaFpOWGx5S01HeHZkMXozV1hKODhNU09ybFM4aXNoaEhKWWZYb3hWZGEteUxkQ3hmWU9xd0RQakdNcHk5WGhEQ21VRFc1TXBncldlRVg5dWc0UndHMg</guid></item><item><title>一半的GLP-1用户放弃注射—有些人正在转向其他减肥方法- MarketWatch</title><link>https://www.marketwatch.com/story/half-of-glp-1-users-ditch-their-injections-and-some-are-turning-to-other-weight-loss-methods-instead-8effac61</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MarketWatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxQZnVYMWx3eVJZT0RJSFFPQjNsVXlvdGtjYWVMYU8tN05GV0xfTm55bHU0SWpzdjFwb0xHTW9xZ01jSG83aktvLXdTRDItNUFmVlhZNGlwT3o0S05BVlJKUWVJUXNGZGR4N1BUdjFCb2tWc3NybVo2YjhYQXpfbm43WmdqaG1MZTRzT21MMk5JSlRTU2E3UjFQZV9xZWc4MHlCcVAtbTdVN3cxT0VMOThYckZabmMtWXNoRGV4ejZOOTg3dmlyakppSDQ5MS1CYkhweDVkc3lrRjV2Y1E</guid></item><item><title>克利夫兰诊所为主校区寻求1级创伤中心- Cleveland.com</title><link>https://www.cleveland.com/news/2026/01/cleveland-clinic-level-1-trauma-center-plan-draws-swift-criticism-from-metrohealth.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HUGPK5R6N5FYTH4PQYQMUXHH2U"&gt;CLEVELAND, Ohio — The Cleveland Clinic announced plans Thursday to establish a Level I trauma center at its main campus in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T5BXSRN5TRETPJ6W2UPHWQS7QA"&gt;The Clinic said it is pursuing accreditation for the Level 1 trauma center that would serve both adults and children.

				&lt;p&gt;When Gabe Brown woke from a coma last January at UPMC Mercy hospital, he could do little more than tilt his head and shift his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old suffered a severe traumatic brain injury nearly four months earlier while on a honeymoon in Jamaica with his wife, Lauren Esper. The slip and fall in the couple’s hotel room left him “as close to death as you can be,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Improbably, his mental acuity was intact when he regained consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A year later, his body is catching up.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Brown can stand for minutes at a time with a specialized walker and eat solid food after months of intensive therapy at a long-term care facility in Erie. A degree of independence is within reach.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;“He has made so much progress,” said Esper, 26, who also lives in Erie.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Recoveries like these are not as unlikely as patients and doctors seem to believe, and should lead them to think twice before withdrawing life support, University of Pittsburgh researchers argue in a new study.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Experts from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California, San Francisco also contributed to the paper, which was published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/abstract/9900/a_propensity_matched_comparison_of_capacity_for.1995.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neurosurgery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;They examined outcomes for more than 500 severe traumatic brain injury patients at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital between 2002 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Those who had their life support withdrawn died, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;But with continued care, about 38% who needed around-the-clock assistance three months into their recoveries achieved partial independence within two years.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Roughly 25% made the leap from no independence to partial independence between the six-month and two-year marks, and 13% did so one to two years post-injury.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;“When patient after patient after patient is having a tremendous recovery from such a dire injury, I become concerned about the patients who were never given the chance to recover,” said Dr. David Okonkwo, director of neurotrauma at UPMC and a senior author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Patients across the two groups were matched based on the seriousness of their injury and other characteristics. Because of this, the recovery statistics in the study also serve as projections of how patients who were taken off life support might have fared otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really powerful question to go back and look at the people who underwent withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and calculate what percentage of them would have returned to independent living,” Okonkwo said.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The findings push back on undue pessimism that can cloud clinical decision-making, according to lead author and Pitt neurosurgery researcher Shawn Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Neurotrauma patients can be a grisly sight early on, often having part of their skull temporarily removed to relieve pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;It’s during these uncertain first few days that decisions about life support are most often made, despite it taking weeks, months or even years to determine the full extent of the damage and possibility for recovery, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The Pitt paper comes less than two years after a study of traumatic brain injury recoveries by Mass General Brigham, supplemented by data from UPMC facilities, reached a similar conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Eagle sees a “growing consensus” that patients with brain trauma can recover better than once thought.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;The road to recovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Coming back from a severe blow to the head is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Patients often need a prolonged stint in an intensive care unit, followed by rehabilitation in a specialized hospital and, finally, extensive outpatient physical, occupational and speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The study acknowledges not all patients or families may be up for this.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;“Waiting two years to see meaningful improvements in function is likely to put significant financial and psychological stressors on the survivor’s family,” researchers noted. “This amount of time may be too extensive for a family to support, especially given that recovery to at least partial independence still represents a minority of survivors.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;But Eagle warns of the “disability paradox” — where people with disabilities often report a good quality of life, contrary to the expectations of able-bodied people.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;“It’s a lot different to be a healthy person and saying the minimum amount you’d tolerate,” Eagle said. “We need to do a better job of understanding how patients and their families see success long term.”&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The study makes no attempt to pinpoint which factors may promote stronger recoveries, though Pitt researchers are currently examining the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;In Okonkwo’s experience, supporting the body’s natural processes and giving people time to bounce back is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;“I have been amazed in my career such that I never underestimate the power of the human body to heal itself,” he said. “We are incredible creatures.”&lt;/p&gt;

The team then used statistical models to generate county-level estimates of MMR vaccination coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Based on vaccination levels, the researchers grouped counties -- and ZIP codes -- into five categories of risk from "lowest risk" with 85% or more of children under 5 years old receiving one or more MMR dose to "very high risk" with fewer than 60% of children under age 5 receiving one or more MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers used "hot spots" to identify areas of low vaccination coverage and "cold spots" to identify areas with high vaccination coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They found hot spots in West Texas, southern New Mexico, parts of Mississippi and across the rural Southeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The authors noted that several of these high-risk hot spot counties were in states that experienced recent measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, Gaines County -- which was the epicenter of last year's measles outbreak in Texas -- was grouped into the second-highest risk category with 60% to 69% of children under age 5 receiving one or more doses of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Lea County, located in New Mexico and the epicenter of that state's outbreak, was grouped into the highest risk category with fewer than 60% of young children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Last year, at least three measles deaths were recorded, including &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/child-measles-dies-texas-hospital-officials/story?id=120539137" target="_blank"&gt;two among unvaccinated school-aged children in Texas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/unvaccinated-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-measles-after/story?id=119529919" target="_blank"&gt;one among an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, marking the first U.S. deaths from measles in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, the researchers found that cold spots were concentrated in the Northeast and Upper Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In Maine, for example, no county was placed in a category higher than medium risk, with every county recording at least 70% to 79% of young children receiving at least one MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We know that outbreaks are highly local, so to be able to respond to an outbreak that is highly localized, you need highly localized data, and this is really a first-of-a-kind study to do this," Brownstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Declining MMR vaccination rates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It comes as the rate of kindergarteners receiving the MMR vaccine has dropped steadily since before the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows.
