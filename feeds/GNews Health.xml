But here’s the kicker: the process isn’t as slow and steady as most of us thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive study reveals some eye-opening insights about aging, focusing on exactly “when” things start to shift and how our bodies begin to break down, both inside and out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging isn’t just about wrinkles and gray hairs – there’s a whole internal, built-in timeline, surprisingly similar for all humans, that we’re only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-the-human-body-start-to-age"&gt;When the human body start to age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man at the helm of the study is Michael Snyder, chair of genetics at &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. His team’s research provides some fascinating insights into the specifics of our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-tea-delays-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biological aging process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snyder and his team explored data from individuals ranging from 25 to 75 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research focused on the different molecules playing significant roles in aging, including those constituting our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-microbiome-trillions-of-bacteria-unique-like-your-fingerprint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbiomes&lt;/a&gt; – the microcosm of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that exist within us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they discovered that 81% of these molecules don’t follow a predictable, chronological pattern as one might expect. Instead, our bodies experience two periods of rapid change as we age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp molecular and microbial shifts occur precisely at ages 44 and 60, a finding that may alter our understanding of how our bodies age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-microbiome-the-basics"&gt;Understanding the microbiome – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your microbiome is basically the bustling community of trillions of microbes – like bacteria, fungi, and viruses – that live in and on your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of them live in your gut, especially in your large intestine, and they’re not just there for lack of anywhere better to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They help you digest food, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-meat-less-protein-lacks-certain-nutrients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;absorb nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, and even produce vitamins like B12 and K. Think of them as your behind-the-scenes health squad, working 24/7 to keep things running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbiome also plays a huge role in your immune system, mood, and even how your brain functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the balance of good and bad microbes gets thrown off – like from antibiotics, stress, or a poor diet – it can mess with everything from your energy levels to how well you sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why you hear so much buzz about probiotics, fermented foods, and fiber. They’re like fuel for your inner ecosystem, helping your microbiome thrive and keeping you feeling your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-correlation-between-aging-and-diseases"&gt;Correlation between aging and diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules related to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-century-of-progress-in-the-fight-against-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, a leading cause of death worldwide, showed substantial changes at both of these age intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, molecules connected to our immune function – our body’s vital defense mechanism against disease – changed significantly in individuals entering their early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were driven to investigate these trends after noticing a sharp rise in the risk of developing age-related conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-why-some-brains-resist-alzheimers-disease-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular disease during mid-life, rather than a steady increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-age-and-the-human-body"&gt;Studying age and the human body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings are based on data obtained from 108 participants, aiming to unlock the mysteries of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/intermittent-fasting-could-be-the-key-to-better-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biology of aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over several years, participants’ biological samples were analyzed every few months, allowing the scientists to track an astonishing 135,000 age-related changes in different molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team discovered thousands of molecules and microbes that undergo shifts, either increasing or decreasing in their abundance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 81 percent of the molecules studied experienced dramatic changes at specific ages. Notably, these transformations were most prevalent when participants were in their mid-40s and early 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xiaotao Shen, who was part of the Stanford Medicine team, pointed out significant changes in the number of molecules related to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/genetics-behind-different-levels-alcohol-consumption-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, caffeine, and lipid metabolism; cardiovascular disease; and skin and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/molecule-in-coffee-trigonelline-keeps-muscles-young/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle health&lt;/a&gt; in individuals in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those in their 60s, changes were observed in carbohydrate and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-coffee-good-for-you-it-may-depend-on-your-genes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;caffeine metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, immune regulation, kidney function, cardiovascular disease, and skin and muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-lifestyle-a-factor"&gt;Is lifestyle a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could our lifestyles be contributing to these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/losing-loved-ones-can-speed-up-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;age-related changes&lt;/a&gt;? Snyder suggests it’s a possibility worth considering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, alcohol metabolism may falter due to the increased alcohol consumption that often occurs in people’s mid-40s, a decade frequently marked by significant life stressors such as career changes, family obligations, or personal challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in behavior can lead to a cascade of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/muscles-defy-aging-with-remarkable-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physiological changes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists plan to delve deeper into the various triggers for these periods of rapid change, exploring how factors like diet, exercise, and stress management interplay with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these connections could pave the way for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/harvard-scientists-fountain-of-youth-pill-sparks-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthier aging strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-role-of-genetics-in-aging"&gt;Role of genetics in aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside our environment and lifestyle choices, our genes significantly impact &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/exposure-certain-odors-pheromones-speeds-up-aging-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how we age&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone has a unique genetic blueprint that can make them more susceptible to certain health issues as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some gene variations can affect how well our bodies break down substances, handle stress, and even heal from injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By understanding these genetic markers, we can gain valuable insights into why some people face age-related health problems sooner than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This knowledge opens the door to personalized medicine, allowing us to create tailored interventions that could boost prevention efforts and enhance our quality of life as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these findings, paying special attention to our health in our 40s and 60s becomes even more critical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple measures like increasing physical activity to protect heart health and maintain muscle mass, or reducing alcohol consumption, could go a long way in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/monthly-aging-treatment-helps-you-live-long-die-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;delaying the ‘break down’ process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a big believer that we should try to adjust our lifestyles while we’re still healthy,” Snyder aptly concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 14:26:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQZEUxdHBzNS1NN3NjZVJPQTBUcXhhYklQVURZbW80UnpTUENGdzhpOFFVQ2hibkdVYVhxVndERzEzcnJJT2pBSWFLWGVMVHMzdHBwLWdYNl9FVkJnbGEwbzJoRmtjOC1GTl96Yk5TRHB6VjdWSWdRa2twMnEyMFM1X3VDeUd4OHFKQmc</guid></item><item><title>Take your fitness to the next level with the 7-Minute Power Workout - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNNnA0dGxNZXZGN3V3WDg2WjlTcllHMU9kdWJReGhDTzg3X2dSRHBsbkExMFN1MmlkWXRBYzMyaF8zSGYzZm1BcnMtV1A2OWtNSDVJWVI3Y3U4WExtUXVuY2dELTMzRnEwMTA2MVBVcjU5c2QtSzVfRmh1UlVwaHJNUFZiQnd0Snh1MzdrdG9SS181cG1pZDJZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story relative"&gt;&lt;p id="GEZCQLHENFABJD2FR3UFSORUOQ" data-contentid="GEZCQLHENFABJD2FR3UFSORUOQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;The more you exercise, the easier it gets. That’s why, at some point, you may need to power up your workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="TOD7TLGENVFWVM5JY5JNDM672Y" data-contentid="TOD7TLGENVFWVM5JY5JNDM672Y" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;It’s important to “find ways to challenge yourself again,” said Chris Jordan, an exercise physiologist and the creator of the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;original, science-based 7-minute workout&lt;/a&gt;. Our bodies adapt to the demands of our current workouts, he continued, adding more heart and lung capacity and other changes that make the same workout you’ve been doing for months feel progressively easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="PJLV PJLV-igWRsMW-css"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ZRYOLSDLRFBB3K2GBO4DTDN3XM" data-contentid="ZRYOLSDLRFBB3K2GBO4DTDN3XM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;This process, known as exercise adaptation, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-020-0377-1?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;makes us more athletic and fit&lt;/a&gt;. But, even more important, it can “contribute toward the delayed onset of age-related disease,” according to a comprehensive 2018 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5983157/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of how regular exercise benefits our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV ad--enterprise"&gt;&lt;div class="PJLV PJLV-ikOErwM-css"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="hide-for-print relative flex justify-center content-box items-center b bh mb-lg mt-lg pt-md pb-md flex"&gt;&lt;div class="center absolute w-100 border-box"&gt;&lt;p class="dib flex divider gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md"&gt;Story continues below advertisement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="OZGSLJEMZ5CYHESZJXSN7GYA7E" data-contentid="OZGSLJEMZ5CYHESZJXSN7GYA7E" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;To help increase your fitness, Jordan developed the 7-Minute Power Workout for The Washington Post. It builds on the scientific principles he used in the original 7-minute workout — featuring 12 movements that increase strength, power and endurance. The exercises focus alternately on the upper and lower body and are meant to be completed at a relatively high intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div target="_blank" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-hHnAni-type-inline wpds-c-PJLV-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-ciKXky wpds-c-ciKXky-hNRVRD-type-inline"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-bmgAQv"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Save this story to do the workout again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="DHL4PHAGCRFHZF4KBPMXFFBYJU" data-contentid="DHL4PHAGCRFHZF4KBPMXFFBYJU" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;That means your effort should feel like an eight on a scale from zero to 10, Jordan said. Or, more informally, you should be able to speak a few words before pausing for breath, he said, but you shouldn’t be able to sing during the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ES5PBWA2WNCYBALJJUXNDRCMOM" data-contentid="ES5PBWA2WNCYBALJJUXNDRCMOM" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;Since the exercises in the new workout are more complex than before, involving a greater range of muscles and coordination, it’s fine to start deliberately and dial in the proper form, Jordan said. Then gradually speed up until you’re pushing yourself during each move for the full seven minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="VSUHTFVRA5E7XIGJMRU52OWJLQ" data-contentid="VSUHTFVRA5E7XIGJMRU52OWJLQ" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;As always, consider talking with your doctor before trying a new exercise routine. Warm up with a few stretches, jumping jacks or high knees. Then complete as many of each exercise as you can in 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="OLX2NOXZQVHFPKZB6U24AZNLK4" data-contentid="OLX2NOXZQVHFPKZB6U24AZNLK4" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css"&gt;So, how can you tell if you’re ready for this power version?

&lt;p&gt;"Acetaminophen seems to make people feel less negative emotion when they consider risky activities – they just don't feel as scared,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;neuroscientist Baldwin Way from The Ohio State University when the findings were published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With nearly 25 percent of the population in the US taking acetaminophen each week, reduced risk perceptions and increased risk-taking could have important effects on society."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that acetaminophen's effects on pain reduction also extend to various psychological processes, lowering people's&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797610374741"&gt;receptivity to hurt feelings&lt;/a&gt;, experiencing&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/9/1345/2224135"&gt;reduced empathy&lt;/a&gt;, and even&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tylenol-may-make-it-harder-for-users-to-spot-errors-says-study"&gt;blunting cognitive functions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147551" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule.jpg" alt="World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior" class="wp-image-147551 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule-545x415.jpg 545w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParacetamolMolecule-600x457.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147551" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A 3D molecule of acetaminophen. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Paracetamol-from-xtal-3D-vdW.png"&gt;Ben Mills/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;span&gt;n a similar way, the research suggests people's affective ability to perceive and evaluate risks may potentially be altered or impaired when they take acetaminophen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the effects might be slight – and should be considered hypothetical for now – they're worth noting, given acetaminophen is the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://liverfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Common-Medicines-with-Acetaminophen-Know-Your-Dose.pdf"&gt;most common drug ingredient in America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, found in over 600 different kinds of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments involving over 500 university students as participants, Way and his team measured how a single 1,000 mg dose of acetaminophen (the recommended maximum adult single dosage) randomly assigned to participants affected their risk-taking behavior, compared against placebos randomly given to a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of the experiments, participants had to pump up an un-inflated balloon on a computer screen, with each single pump earning imaginary money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their instructions were to earn as much imaginary money as possible by pumping the balloon as much as possible, but to make sure not to pop the balloon, in which case they would lose the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the students who took acetaminophen engaged in significantly more risk-taking during the exercise, relative to the more cautious and conservative  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="156692" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; group. On the whole, those on acetaminophen pumped (and burst) their balloons more than the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147552" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay.jpg" alt="World's Most Common Pain Relief Drug May Induce Risky Behavior" class="wp-image-147552 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay-303x415.jpg 303w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/BaldwinWay-600x821.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147552" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Baldwin Way, who led the research. (&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Ohio State News&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're risk-averse, you may pump a few times and then decide to cash out because you don't want the balloon to burst and lose your money,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Way said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But for those who are on acetaminophen, as the balloon gets bigger, we believe they have less anxiety and less negative emotion about how big the balloon is getting and the possibility of it bursting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the balloon simulation, participants also filled out surveys during two of the experiments, rating the level of risk they perceived in various hypothetical scenarios, such as betting a day's income on a sporting event, bungee jumping off a tall bridge, or driving a car without a seatbelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the surveys, acetaminophen consumption did appear to reduce perceived risk compared to the control group, although in another similar survey, the same effect wasn't observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While an experiment like this doesn't necessarily reflect how acetaminophen might affect people in real-life scenarios, based on an average of results across the various tests, the team concluded that there is a significant relationship between taking acetaminophen and choosing more risk, even if the observed effect appears slight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the researchers acknowledged the drug's apparent effects on risk-taking behavior could also be interpreted via other kinds of psychological processes, such as reduced anxiety, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It may be that as the balloon increases in size, those on placebo feel increasing amounts of anxiety about a potential burst,"&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsaa108/5897711"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When the anxiety becomes too much, they end the trial. Acetaminophen may reduce this anxiety, thus leading to greater risk taking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring such psychological alternative explanations for this phenomenon – as well as investigating the biological mechanisms responsible for acetaminophen's effects on people's choices in situations like this – should be addressed in future research, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential impact of acetaminophen's effect on people's risk perception, the drug nonetheless remains one of the most important and highly used medications in the world, considered an&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines"&gt;essential medicine by the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, even if other questions linger&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We really need more research on the effects of acetaminophen and other over-the-counter drugs on the choices and risks we take," &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.osu.edu/a-pain-reliever-that-alters-perceptions-of-risk/"&gt;Way said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/scan/nsaa108"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A subsequent commentary published in 2021 highlighted some criticisms of the original study and its interpretation in the media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to better reflect the hypothetical nature of the study and its findings.

But instead of taking it for granted, we asked nutritionists: Are apples good for you? Plus, we looked at what the research says about eating the fruit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephani-johnson-dcn-rdn-88856120/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stephani Johnson;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stephani Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, D.C.N., R.D.N., is an adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition sciences at &lt;a href="https://shp.rutgers.edu/?_gl=1%2Ai4adtj%2A_gcl_au%2AMTUyNTkyNDg3Mi4xNzQwNTA4MTQ2&amp;amp;_ga=2.151383929.1366124760.1742845226-227429285.1738870850" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rutgers University School of Health Professions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rutgers University School of Health Professions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evelyn-arteche-rdn-a6854611/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Evelyn Arteche;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Evelyn Arteche&lt;/a&gt;, M.S., R.D.N., C.P.T., C.G.F.I. is at &lt;a href="https://www.cooperhealth.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cooper University Health Care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cooper University Health Care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it bad to eat an apple every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, no. “While apples contain fructose, a natural sugar in all fruits, they are a valuable part of a healthy diet,” says Stephani Johnson, D.C.N., R.D.N., adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition sciences at Rutgers University School of Health Professions. “Their nutrient density and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a33382312/fiber-for-weight-loss/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; content contribute to overall health, making them a beneficial choice for daily consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get more specific, medium apples typically have about 4.4 grams of fiber, which can help you to meet the daily recommended fiber intake of 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. Apples also count as one of your five servings of fruits and vegetables, which should be a daily goal, says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since they do contain sugar, to minimize blood sugar spikes, control the portion size of apples and pair them with protein and healthy fats, such as nut butter, cheese, or yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the nutritional value of apples?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the breakdown for &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/1750341/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one medium apple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one medium apple&lt;/a&gt; with skin, which is about three inches in diameter (roughly the size of a baseball or a small fist):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health benefits of apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, Johnson and Evelyn Arteche, M.S., R.D.N., C.P.T., C.G.F.I., at Cooper University Health Care, break down some of the reasons to consider eating apples regularly. “It is important to note that you get more nutrition value from eating a whole apple with the skin,” Arteche says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoother digestion: &lt;/strong&gt;The fiber in apples can help promote bowel regularity. “Additionally, the pectin in apple skin serves as a prebiotic, supporting a healthy microbiome and overall gut health,” says Johnson. “Research indicates that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in various aspects of health, including mental well-being, disease risk, and immune function.” Studies explicitly examining the effects of apples on gut health are limited, but extensive research supports the beneficial impacts of fiber and pectin on gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight management: &lt;/strong&gt;“Apples can aid in weight management, particularly when consumed in place of higher-calorie, less healthy options,” says Johnson. Research specifically evaluating the effects of apple consumption on weight management in humans is limited. But, Johnson points to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26394033/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one 2015 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one 2015 study&lt;/a&gt; which found that higher fruit and vegetable intake, as well as increased intake of apples and pears, was inversely associated with weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-fiber foods with high water content, such as apples, promote satiety so you feel fuller longer than if you, say, ate a cookie. “Fiber slows down gastric emptying and induces a feeling of fullness lasting longer when compared to drinking juice, for example, which does not contain much fiber,” says Arteche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart health: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies have yielded mixed results specifically regarding apple consumption and heart health. “Despite these mixed findings, substantial research links diets rich in fruits and vegetables and low in processed foods to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension, as seen in those following the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a20455774/lower-blood-pressure-dash-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;,” says Johnson. “Increasing fruit and vegetable intake, including apples, may contribute to cardiovascular health by supporting gut microbiome balance, promoting weight management, and providing antioxidants that help neutralize free radicals implicated in cardiovascular disease risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential side effects of eating apples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diarrhea:&lt;/strong&gt; “Fiber in excess can cause diarrhea in some people,” says Arteche. “For example, people with conditions such as Crohn’s disease, diverticulitis, gastroparesis, ulcerative colitis, a new colostomy, or a new ileostomy may need to avoid apples, especially apples with skin on them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food allergies:&lt;/strong&gt; “People who are allergic to apricot, plum, almond, peach, pear, and strawberry can also be allergic to apples and should avoid them,” says Arteche.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood sugar elevation:&lt;/strong&gt; “Although apples are a healthy, low-calorie food, they are naturally high in sugar, which may contribute to blood sugar elevations, especially in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes,” says Johnson. “However, in comparison to other fruits, apples have a lower glycemic index, meaning that they do not spike blood sugar to the same extent as some other carbohydrate foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples generally are safe to eat daily unless you have a food allergy, or other medical reason to avoid them. (Always talk to your healthcare provider if you’re unsure whether a food is for you or not.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to their fiber and water content, apples promote digestive regularity and also may help you feel fuller longer, so they can play a role in weight management. They also contribute to your daily goal for both fiber and servings of fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 13:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9BTjRheEgwZ0JYaGZRLTRQZ2R1aE96VXlndl9VeVBXejdMXzVXaEhkYzhBbjFhenVXRlRJZjk5dDhGYnlsNWxmb1lOMDYzYnVGMDNTVmhhYjJwUGdlZm1GWFR5SnpaQW9lb3c</guid></item><item><title>Breakfast should be your biggest meal of the day, here's the latest insight on why - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE9wY1o4VU1pUUNsUEdwckNTSXZuRi1kLXVOQ0dIREI1bk5Gby0teGIyazhKRm1penk0RHFHYUZYclVzdjRSc1MwWURfaXVORE5GR2FYRXFKNHZxaW51U05OajhYS2FoRzlhRC0xR1J1WGc1YU1vZEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast should be your &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:biggest meal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;biggest meal&lt;/a&gt; of the day — you've heard this before.

provide sustained energy, according to studies," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, a larger meal at night can be more difficult to digest, increase the likelihood of acid reflux and disrupted sleep due to slower metabolism during the evening, Routhenstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating a large meal before bedtime can cause acid reflux and disrupt sleep, a dietitian told Fox News Digital.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The

have an appetite and the time for a larger breakfast, you may notice fewer cravings and urges to eat at night, more stable energy levels throughout the day and better concentration, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moskovitz stressed, however, that there is no one-size-fits-all methodology for meal planning and portion distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best way to plan out meals is to sit down and figure out your specific needs, lifestyle and what's realistic," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you want to ingest some kind of nourishment every three to four hours throughout the day — starting with the first hour you wake up and aiming to give yourself at least two to three hours of digestive rest before bedtime, Moskovitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating a big breakfast could lead to more stable energy levels throughout the day and better concentration, according to a dietitian.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, people report feeling more energy, fewer cravings and reasonable calorie intake when they make time for a balanced, protein- and fiber-rich breakfast," she said, further making the case for a filling breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moskovitz shared a day-in-the-life example of front-loading your diet by eating a larger breakfast, followed by smaller meals for lunch and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast: &lt;/strong&gt;Choose from any of the following options&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 eggs + 2 slices of sprouted grain bread + ½ avocado + 1 cup of fresh fruit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1

and sufficient energy throughout the day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein's sample meal plan, adhering to this bigger breakfast principle, makes use of a robust, savory breakfast, followed

class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00385-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that adults who report high levels of autistic traits through online surveys may not reflect the same social behaviors or clinical profiles as those who have been formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Although these two groups may appear similar on paper, the study found meaningful differences in their social interactions, mental health symptoms, and the way they perceive and influence others during social tasks. The findings raise questions about the widespread reliance on self-report surveys in online autism research and suggest that diagnostic evaluations by trained professionals remain essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by a team at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, were motivated by a growing trend in psychiatric research: the shift toward large-scale, web-based studies. Online platforms like Prolific allow researchers to gather data from thousands of people quickly and inexpensively. While this approach has clear advantages in terms of scale and accessibility, it often relies solely on participants’ own descriptions of their traits and mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By allowing people to participate in research remotely and anonymously, online studies ease many of the burdens associated with in-person involvement and allow researchers to recruit large samples quickly. However, as online studies become increasingly popular in psychiatric research, it is essential to evaluate their limitations,” said study authors Sarah M. Banker, who is now a postdoctoral fellow NYU Langone, and Xiaosi Gu, an associate professor and director of the Center for Computational Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notably, anonymous online research typically relies on self-report to measure symptoms and identify participants with specific psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Without the added context of clinical evaluation, self-reported symptoms may be limited in their ability to capture the experiences and diagnoses of people who have difficulties describing their emotions and struggles – including many autistic individuals. Our study sought to evaluate whether autistic participants identified through online self-reported symptoms show similar profiles to those identified through in-person clinical evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared three groups of adults. One group included 56 individuals who were diagnosed with autism after undergoing in-person clinical evaluations. The second group consisted of 56 people recruited online who reported high levels of autistic traits using a standard survey. A third group, also recruited online, reported low levels of autistic traits and served as a comparison. All participants were matched in age and gender to allow for fair comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a mix of questionnaires and interactive tasks. All participants completed the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire, which measures characteristics often associated with autism, including social difficulties and rigid behavior. The in-person group also underwent clinical interviews and standardized assessments conducted by trained professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, all three groups participated in two computer-based tasks designed to simulate social interactions. One task measured the participant’s ability to influence the behavior of virtual characters to gain rewards, while the other tracked their social decision-making over time, such as whether they acted warmly or distantly toward new characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that although the high-trait online group and the in-person autism group reported similar levels of autistic traits, their profiles differed in key ways. The online group with high autistic traits reported more symptoms of social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder than the clinically diagnosed group. In fact, their psychiatric profiles resembled those of people who are socially anxious but not necessarily autistic. This suggests that some people who score high on autism trait questionnaires in the general population may actually be describing a different type of social struggle—one rooted more in anxiety than in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings came from the comparison between self-report and clinical assessment. Among participants with a confirmed autism diagnosis, there was no meaningful relationship between how they rated their own symptoms and how clinicians rated them. This held true for both core domains of autism: repetitive behaviors and social communication. The two types of measures seemed to capture different aspects of the condition—one reflecting internal experience and the other focusing on observable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that, for adults with a confirmed autism spectrum disorder diagnosis (and without co-occurring intellectual disability), higher clinician-rated symptoms did not correspond to higher self-reported symptoms,” Banker and Gu told PsyPost. “This finding suggests that the two measures capture different aspects of autism: while self-reported assessments may capture internal experiences, clinician-rated assessments may capture external presentations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences also emerged in how participants behaved during the social interaction tasks. In the first task, which tested whether participants could influence virtual characters by accepting or rejecting monetary offers, the in-person autism group showed reduced ability to recognize and use social influence. They rejected fewer high offers and did not adjust their behavior in ways that would have led to better future outcomes. They also reported less awareness of their ability to influence the game, suggesting a diminished perception of social controllability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, both the high-trait and low-trait online groups performed similarly on this task and showed more awareness of their influence. This points to a key distinction: while individuals in both online groups may share internal feelings of social difficulty, their external behavior in social contexts does not mirror the social differences seen in people with a clinical autism diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second task, which involved choosing how to interact with different characters during a simulated narrative, the in-person autism group again showed unique patterns. They were less likely to choose friendly or affiliative responses, even when their self-reported feelings toward the characters were similar to those of the online high-trait group. This gap between internal attitude and external behavior was specific to the clinically diagnosed group, suggesting that their social behavior was more affected by their condition than by their feelings or intentions alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite similarly high levels of self-reported autistic traits, adults recruited online (without self-identification of an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis) and those recruited in-person (with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis confirmed through clinical evaluation) displayed different psychiatric profiles and tendencies during simulated social interactions, suggesting they may represent different groups,” Banker and Gu explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that, without additional information (such as diagnostic information collected by trained professionals), self-reported symptom surveys may not be sufficient to identify or draw representative conclusions about certain diagnoses, including autism spectrum disorder. This work emphasizes the important distinction between diagnoses and traits and provides a caution against the potential for generating assumptions about one group based on the findings from research conducted in another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters not just for research, but also for clinical care. If online studies are used to shape understanding of autism or to develop interventions, it is important that the participants truly reflect the population the research aims to help. Otherwise, there is a risk of creating treatments or policies that are not effective—or even relevant—for those who are clinically diagnosed with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding is also interesting when considering the emerging use of online mental health platforms, where clinician evaluation is not always available and symptom severity (and improvement) only relies solely on self-report,” the researchers noted. “Our finding suggests that such approach might need to be revisited and compared against human clinician evaluations/ratings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers were also careful to note that self-reports still have an important role to play. They are valuable tools for understanding how individuals experience their own challenges. In fact, self-reports can offer insights that clinicians might miss, particularly when it comes to internal states like anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although our findings highlight discrepancies between self-reported and clinician-rated symptoms, they do not diminish the value of self-report surveys in autism research,” Banker and Gu said. “In fact, self-reports are crucial for understanding individuals’ own experiences, internal distress, and overall wellbeing. They also empower individuals with lived experience to shape narratives about their condition and help to challenge inaccurate assumptions about the reasons behind autistic behaviors. Rather than discounting personal perspectives, our results emphasize caution for researchers in relying solely on self-reported symptom measures when defining or generalizing about diagnostic groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00385-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Phenotypic divergence between individuals with self-reported autistic traits and clinically ascertained autism&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sarah M.

The collection had accrued over the course of several years, picked up – and then swiftly dropped. Health sprees that &lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/century-of-fad-diets-history-weight-loss-trends-b2689369.html"&gt;only had a hefty bill&lt;/a&gt; from Holland &amp;amp; Barrett to show for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of us are susceptible to the idea that&lt;a href="/life-style/food-and-drink/features/collagen-food-diet-supplements-b2717960.html"&gt; “investing” in our health&lt;/a&gt; equates to spending hard-earned cash to prove to ourselves that we’re serious. The unworn trainers or expensive yoga pants, the unused gym membership (a cliché because it’s true) – and, for others like me, a huge box of very good intentions, rattling around the drawer under the bathroom sink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did I clear out everything best before 2022 (or, in some cases, 2019)? Yes. Did I also reignite the urge to buy more? Naturally. Like most people, I’d also been recently caught in the TikTok wellness trap, where everyone appears to have the answers, no matter what their credentials. Powdered greens – a dietary supplement of vegetables, fruits and algae which claims to be a concentrated dose of nutrients – appeared to be a brilliantly easy panacea, as did &lt;a href="/topic/supplements"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt; I’d never previously taken notice of – milk thistle, to cleanse a tired liver for a tenner, or ashwagandha to lower blood pressure and anxiety, and collagen for pretty much everything else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t need pointing out that the platform has very little merit in the health world, yet sales of beauty and wellness products such as supplements are through the roof on ever-influential TikTok Shop – and this is big business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the supplements industry, health really is wealth. Over the last 15 years, the over-the-counter &lt;a href="/topic/vitamins"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals market has grown exponentially, generating more than £650m in UK sales last year. In the US, it’s far higher, with one of the more conservative estimates suggesting Americans will be swallowing $70bn of supplements by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, unsurprising. Five years ago, we lived through an unprecedented global health crisis that, when life was boiled down to the bare basics, gave us all a thorough wake-up call. Covid led us all to reconsider our perceptions of health, the way we live and, crucially, how we prevent ourselves from getting ill. Naturally, many people turned to quick-fix supplements – and sales were their highest in more than a decade; almost twice the amount sold nationally last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability is what the supplement sector thrives on – but as to whether they work, it’s a lot more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One size does not fit all &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should think about taking supplements like a prescription,” says registered nutritional therapist &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gqjordannutrition"&gt;GQ Jordan&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the time, we’re conditioned to think that taking supplements, whatever they are, must be safeguarding or improving our health. We forget that health – existing or genetically predisposed conditions, our levels of fitness and diet – is not an equal starting point for all of us. Additionally, some over-the-counter vitamins and minerals can interact with medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another; everyone has their own signs and symptoms of what they might be lacking, probably the first thing to do is to track those to see if there’s any consistency. So, if you’re waking up in the night consistently or having an energy dip in the afternoon, it might be a good sign to consider taking some magnesium or vitamin D to see if they help,” advises Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 iTcyPS"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/31/iStock-1925319130.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="‘It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another,’ says a women’s health nutritionist" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177518"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;‘It’s really important to try and take a personalised approach to all of these things – what works for one person might not work for another,’ says a women’s health nutritionist&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If at all possible, Jordan says, speak to your GP about your own health status before deciding what you need supplementing, and before sinking a load of cash into your local pharmacy. Or, if that’s not possible and you can afford to, put that money towards seeing a nutritionist. Getting goodness through diet is more sustainable in the long run because of how things are broken down in our gut. Some supplements aren’t suitable for people with underlying health concerns, especially when it comes to the liver, which must process everything you put in your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember that your requirements will change depending on your current situation. As we age, our hormones change drastically, which can change what we need and how much of it is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not all supplements are made equal &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from it.

Not all supplements have them in – and many don’t have the right amount in. For a good supplement, you want the actual ingredient, limited non-active and synthetic ingredients, and to get the right dose. There are many that I come across where I’ll look at the formula and think, ‘What is that even doing?’ Often there’s no real benefit at all.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 jDSKHB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/28/11/13/iStock-1221668431-(1).jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="You can’t out-supplement a bad diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177519"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;You can’t out-supplement a bad diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like in ultra-processed foods, look at how many ingredients are listed. Too many non-active or synthetic ingredients make it much harder for the body to digest and, adds Jordan, can cause more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “You could think that you’re safeguarding your health or being proactive, which comes from a really good place, but then choose supplements that might not be right for you on a personal level or up to scratch. That could have a real impact on other aspects of your health, particularly your &lt;a href="/topic/gut-health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, because the supplements contain all these buffers and preservatives that aren’t really essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gut lining is super-sensitive. It’s the barrier between our outside world and our body, essentially, and these things can have a compounding irritating effect.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of the label, look out for “synthetics versus natural food form”, recommends Vaughan. “Most people assume that vitamins and minerals are natural. In fact, one survey found that 70 per cent of people think that vitamins and minerals in fortified foods are natural, but they’re not – they’re synthetic. Similarly in the supplement world, there’s a huge knowledge gap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You can’t ‘out supplement’ a bad diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m allergic to the wellness industry wheel,” Jordan jokes. “Most of the ads we all see online – things like green powders, for example – should be under investigation, in my opinion. Many of them create pain points for people and then target them for vulnerability: weight loss, infertility … Solve your PCOS [polycystic ovary syndrome] with an expensive green powder. It’s really dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 hWkBIi"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/26/17/28/iStock-1337117159.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Most people assume that all vitamins and minerals are natural... not so" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177520"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Most people assume that all vitamins and minerals are natural... not so&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it can mean that we end up feeling more comfortable paying less attention to what we’re actually eating. “Nothing can supplement a bad lifestyle,” Jordan says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaughan agrees. “Based on dietary data, around 75 per cent of people in the UK are not eating enough oily fish,” she says. Generally, our diets have changed exponentially in the last few decades – and Vaughan knows the impact from her own health struggles with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. “I forced myself to eat liver, which is full of nutrients, when I went through my own health struggles,” she explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, especially in poorer communities, we used to eat much more offal and cheap oily fish such as kippers. It goes without saying that we should also be focusing on eating lots of rich, leafy greens and moving our bodies enough, which all helps with our gut health and would alleviate the need for so many supplements in the first place. That baseline, both Vaughan and Jordan agree, must be heeded before we start trying to compensate over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you take just one supplement, this should be it &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a close call here: for Jordan, vitamin D, omega 3 and magnesium all chart high; for Vaughan, omega 3 just about tips it with vitamin D a close second. In fact, the government recommends we should all take a supplement for vitamin D, as thanks to the lack of sunlight in the UK, which stimulates the production of it in our bodies naturally, most of us are deficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I actually recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in winter and autumn months,” says Jordan. “Just having that can really help your energy, help your mood, help your gut as well, and your immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="5" class="sc-482ou5-0 hItpXp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/15/15/iStock-532447843.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Experts recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in the winter months" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-177521"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Experts recommend taking vitamin D all year round, not just in the winter months&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even when we are eating enough oily fish, which is packed with omega 3, Vaughan notes that recent years have seen fluctuations in the amount of nutrients we’re getting from fish like salmon and mackerel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s some evidence that omega 3 levels in oily fish have been declining over the last 50 years,” she explains. So there’s a combination of, not only are we not eating enough, but the amount that you used to have to eat to get enough omega 3 is now no longer enough either, so it exacerbates it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Omega 3s are so important for us at the cellular level – every single cell membrane needs omega 3s to kind of work their membranes to work flexibly, to let nutrients in, let waste out. They’re also good for hormone balance, brain function. It’s incredibly necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan agrees, adding that it’s especially important in pregnancy and postpartum. “A particular DHA, a specific type of omega 3, is given to the baby, not mum in that time. So women who have experienced brain fog after giving birth, for example, might benefit from supplementing with omega 3 to get those levels back up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 12:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTGhJd2h1Vjl0bDhubWRhMjl5QmUtdmc2bzBYdm1mOFA0OEpOdVAwMjlENVF0WTRNN0MzcG0tb0t3TkJiUFpDMFFtaEZrM0FqcDV1aDRfY0JMakxsUWplSjFaNGRtZVBWZUhFU2NON1hMY25KOUZsN3otVWwwX280WDFDbjJ5MVZRYnBJS25xWVp2MVBDa0VNZk50MnA</guid></item><item><title>Study links increasing sleepiness, higher dementia risk among older women - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPU1pJY2cwaVdzY0ZXVXZDaUZGek9Od0tmVlR4QTM5X1VQWnJ1UGZvdTQ0T0lhdVp5Z19qQi02ek9PdGt3bDBWUExYcFFuNElLdHlwNEhuS1VOeHJkNzdCVjJyTDhOcEdCTmdqM2lDeXZ1MXE3RE5aOEgwTC02R29XelZWUFZyaEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T4EQAL4R7JDMRBP3VDW5MYYZAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Women in their 80s who experience increasing sleepiness over time have double the risk of developing dementia than their counterparts with stable sleep patterns, a recent analysis suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2CORXJTQ3FD77FEUOHF6G7BCJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Published in Neurology, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213403" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; looked at data from 733 women without cognitive impairment who participated in a study that  ran  between 2002 and 2009. The women were a mean of 82.5 years old at the start of the study, and they used a wrist device that tracked their sleep and circadian rhythm patterns over three consecutive days once at the start of the study and again five years later. Patients filled out sleep logs and were given neuropsychological tests during the five-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QBTFE5LLTBHQ5C74TB4WB5I64A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On average, participants’ total sleep time increased by 18.7 minutes during the five-year follow-up period, and sleep efficiency — a score of sleep quality — increased by 0.94 percent on average.

Another 34.9 percent were categorized as having declining nighttime sleep, with decreased nighttime sleep quality and slight increases in daytime napping. The final group, which made up 21.3 percent of the women, saw “large increases in daytime and nighttime sleep duration and quality,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U735HJJSSBHLPL3DYX5TPILDWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Overall, 93 of the women — 12.7 percent — developed dementia during the study period.

After much research, she began massaging &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/benefits-olive-oil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:olive oil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; and rosemary oil into her scalp at night to stimulate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Nicole Saphier shared natural remedies for hair thinning on "Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It took some patience, but I began seeing significant regrowth and improvement within one to two months of doing this regimen and I haven’t stopped!" she told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My personal experience has continued to reinforce my belief in the power of integrative care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she also put together a collection of liquid natural herbs including gotu kola, horsetail and biotin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To promote blood flow to the scalp - which helps with hair growth - the doctor said she increased her &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/green-tea-fueling-weight-loss-experts-skinny-truth" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:green tea intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;green tea intake&lt;/a&gt; and focused on exercising and hydrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As long as you are &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating healthy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating healthy&lt;/a&gt; and living healthy, your hair, your skin and your nails will have the nutrients that they need to grow," she said on "Fox &amp;amp; Friends Weekend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/hair-growth-could-slow-down-popular-diet-plan-study-reveals" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hair Growth Could Slow Down With This Popular Diet Plan, Study Reveals;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair Growth Could Slow Down With This Popular Diet Plan, Study Reveals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to consult a medical professional if experiencing any issues, she stressed, so that the healthcare provider can find and address the root cause of the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saphier also discussed gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Saphier shared tips for good gut health. "Your entire body's wellness focuses on your gut," she said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gut health is tied to everything," said Dr. Saphier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your entire body’s &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/wellness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wellness focuses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;wellness focuses&lt;/a&gt; on your gut, and we have destroyed our guts with antibiotics and processed foods and all these other things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chef-says-stomach-problems-led-maha-journey" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chef Says 'Horrible Stomach Problems' Led Him On Maha Journey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chef Says 'Horrible Stomach Problems' Led Him On Maha Journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she really likes a comprehensive approach to gut health.

Among the best foods for fiber are raspberries, lentils and avocado, said Saphier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, she said she promotes gut motility (the coordinated muscular contractions that move food and waste through the gastrointestinal tract) with ginger, plus staying hydrated &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/fitness-and-wellbeing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:and exercising;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;and exercising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You do all of that and your gut is going to be as healthy as can be," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the impact of stress on hair loss and gut health? The doctor said that stress isn't just a feeling; it's an actual physiological effect on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"Managing stress isn’t about eliminating it," she said.

This phantom noise often takes a toll on sleep, focus, and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/mental-health-in-the-workplace-navigating-challenges-and-promoting-well-being/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, increasing feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The root cause lies in disrupted nerve activity, usually after damage to the ear or head. But other factors—like background noise, attention levels, memory, and mood—can shape how severe it feels. Despite years of study, no cure has emerged, though the search continues with growing urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the challenge stems from &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-study-reveals-hidden-hearing-modes-within-the-human-ear/"&gt;tinnitus’s strange nature&lt;/a&gt;. People hear what isn’t there—buzzing, ringing, or hissing. Because it doesn’t stem from a single injury or illness, treatments have mostly tried to ease symptoms, not eliminate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional therapies focus on reshaping how the brain responds to the phantom sound. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&lt;/a&gt; (CBT) helps people cope with distress, while sound therapies try to mask or soften the perception. Results have been mixed, and relief varies from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Associate Professor Grant Searchfield says this is a treatment made possible by recent technology developments.

Here, tools like Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) or acoustic stimulation attempt to retrain the brain. They work to reduce the sound's emotional impact or help the brain filter it out over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="transforming_treatment_with_digital_therapeutics"&gt;Transforming Treatment with Digital Therapeutics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent study at the &lt;a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt; compared TRT with a partial version of the therapy and standard care. Researchers tracked 151 patients for 18 months. In the full TRT group, 47.1% showed clear improvement in quality of life, versus 40.5% who received standard care. While promising, these gains were modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other trials have looked to technology for answers. The ACR T30 Neurostimulator used targeted sound bursts to disrupt brain patterns. Yet the results showed little difference from placebo. A separate study that paired sound therapy with tongue stimulation also produced only slight improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Grant Searchfield, who led the study, explained, "This therapy de-emphasizes tinnitus, relegating it to background noise with no meaning or relevance." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 12-week trial, 65% of participants reported improvement, with some experiencing life-changing results. Audiology research fellow Dr. Phil Sanders noted, "For some, it shifted from overwhelming their lives to being manageable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.958730/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, randomized 61 patients, comparing the polytherapeutic app to a widely-used white noise app. Significant improvements were observed in the polytherapeutic group, including reduced tinnitus severity and enhanced mental well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings mark a critical milestone in tinnitus treatment, emphasizing the potential of comprehensive, accessible digital interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Example screenshots for (A) the USL intervention (i) Menu, (ii) Passive therapy sounds, (iii) AOIL task, (iv) Tracking task.

Factors such as environmental conditions, psychological predispositions, and individual neural patterns influence its manifestation. This variability highlights the limitations of one-size-fits-all treatments and underscores the need for personalized therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now exploring tailored approaches. By understanding each patient’s unique &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/revolutionary-tinnitus-therapy-could-greatly-improve-the-lives-of-40-million-us-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tinnitus profile&lt;/a&gt; and treatment goals, therapies can be customized to target specific symptoms or underlying mechanisms. Early efforts include goal-oriented counseling and personalized sound therapy, focusing on aspects such as attention retraining and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary studies have shown promise in combining behavioral interventions with digital tools. For instance, a prototype &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifesaving-smartphone-app-turns-your-phone-into-a-blood-pressure-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;smartphone-based digital therapeutic&lt;/a&gt; tested alongside counseling methods showed encouraging outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach integrates tools for relief and adaptation, guided by patient feedback and behavioral needs. As these methods evolve, they hold potential to transform the standard of care for tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Audiogram for per protocol participants.

Larger, multi-center trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy and scalability of digital polytherapeutics. Researchers aim to refine these tools, incorporating real-time feedback and expanding their capabilities. Combining digital therapies with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/cholesterol-medications-could-slow-the-progression-of-alzheimer-s-disease-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; or other interventions may further enhance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaborative effort between the University of Auckland and &lt;a href="https://www.tinnitracks.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tinnitracks&lt;/a&gt;, a German company specializing in tinnitus therapeutics, illustrates the global commitment to innovation.

They are, however, one of a few reasons you might consider &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/do-you-need-to-wash-rice-before-cooking-heres-the-science-71588" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;washing your grains&lt;/a&gt; in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are rice weevils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils are a natural part of the environment, and just like us, they love snacking. They do indeed, as their name suggests, love rice, but they are also known to feast on crops of things like corn and other grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/fossilized-insects-photonic-diamonds-reveal-the-evolution-of-structural-color-55717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;weevils&lt;/a&gt; they have a delightfully noodly snoot that they use to gnaw into the hard casing of rice grains. Not only do they feed on the good stuff inside, but females will also lay their eggs inside rice grains. This is how a rice weevil’s journey to your pantry begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="82965" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;What in the prison break do these rice weevil larva think they're playing at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Tomasz Klejdysz / Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do weevils get into rice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial rice production involves a certain amount of fumigating to try and keep the stock clear of pests, but it’s rarely 100 percent effective. The adult weevils are tiny, but the larvae are even harder to catch because they travel as stowaways tucked safely inside the rice grain. According to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fjzjphH6CM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Deep Look&lt;/a&gt;, scientists have even tried using sound to track down infestations in rice stores by listening out for their chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They feed on the inside of the rice grain until it’s just an empty shell and then crawl out as adult weevils. Once out, they can start the process of laying their own eggs and this is how even just a couple of weevils can result in an infestation if rice isn’t stored properly and goes uneaten for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fjzjphH6CM??si=CCyBvOPZMranhIP8&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing rice weevils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils are more common the closer you are to the source, as a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5923/j.ijaf.20140401.03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that raw milled rice contained the highest number of weevils. This number dropped off in more treated rice samples, such as that being imported and parboiled rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pre-storage treatment of rice contributes to the likelihood of a rice weevil infestation as well as the actual rice grains themselves, and the researchers suggest that heat sterilization can be effective in minimizing rice weevils. That said, that some weevils make it past fumigation and importation to the bags in some people’s pantries isn’t the end of the world, because eating a couple of weevils won’t hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-image-container no-background" data-asset-id="82966" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="fr-figcaption"&gt;&lt;p class="fr-caption"&gt;Rice weevils won't hurt you, but if you leave your rice sitting around for months, they could destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fr-reference"&gt;Image credit: Aurius / Shutterstock.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are rice weevils harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice weevils aren't always going to be in rice, and even if they were, eating a few won’t harm you. If anything, it’s just going to boost the protein content of your grains a bit, but you can sweep away rice weevils by &lt;a href="https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-safety-tips/food-risk-concerns/risk-at-a-glance/rice-weevils#:~:text=Consumers%20can%20remove%20rice%20weevils,to%20consume%20the%20rice%20thereafter." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;washing your rice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where rice weevils can be harmful is in their hunger for dried goods, and if left to their own devices they’ll reduce your grains to a heap of creepy dust. This is why managing rice weevils is a bit matter of concern for large-scale producers who don’t want to lose their stock, but you the consumer with your modest bag of rice at home don’t need to worry. If you’d like to be extra careful, you can make sure to store your rice properly in an air-tight container somewhere cool and dry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not want to be accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkKHRp9YO0o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;eating insects&lt;/a&gt;, but there is something to be said for making these terrestrial arthropods part of the menu.

During the study period, 11,173 people were diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were categorized by how much processed red meat they ate, with “low” being under 0.1 servings per day, “medium” being between 0.1 and 0.24 servings per day, and “high” being 0.25 or more servings per day. A typical serving of processed red meat is 3 ounces, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/red-meat-increases-risk-of-dementia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to a press release" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/red-meat-increases-risk-of-dementia" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt; for the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When compared with the “low” group, people with the largest consumption of processed red meat per day had a 13% higher chance of developing dementia. Hot dogs, sausage, salami, bologna and bacon were all categorized as processed red meat by the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also looked at objective cognitive function, which relates to a person’s memory and ability to solve problems, and found that study participants in the high group had reduced cognitive abilities and faster brain aging compared with those in the low group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all pretty grim. Deli meat sandwiches are a regular lunch staple for many, and eggs and bacon are commonplace as well. All hope is not lost though ― swapping out processed red meat now can help reduce your dementia risk as you age. The study found that eating fish, nuts or legumes instead of processed red meat could lower dementia risk by roughly 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/14072-dylan-wint" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Dylan Wint" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/14072-dylan-wint" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Dylan Wint&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas, said the findings of this study are consistent with other research suggesting that people should limit red meat intake for their brain health. (Wint was not associated with the study.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the dietary recommendations around reducing dementia risk do talk about trying to limit your total amount of red meat intake,” Wint said. “So, for example, the MIND diet that was developed at Rush University ...

One is the DASH diet, which &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="aims to help" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;aims to help&lt;/a&gt; manage high blood pressure and boost heart health.

This notion is not only clear in the recent Neurology study, but in &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/leafy-greens-linked-slower-age-related-cognitive-decline" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="various" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/leafy-greens-linked-slower-age-related-cognitive-decline" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;various&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/pathogenic-tau-and-cognitive-impairment-are-precipitated-high-salt-diet" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/pathogenic-tau-and-cognitive-impairment-are-precipitated-high-salt-diet" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, too. A diet that’s low in processed red meat and high in foods like poultry, fish, legumes, fruit and nuts is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But getting proper nutrition isn’t the only way to ensure brain health. “I would say that the No. 1 intervention is probably physical exercise,” Wint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every physician wants you to exercise, but from a brain health perspective we know there are small molecules that help improve brain health,” Liu noted. “Specifically, there’s a growth factor that’s released when we exercise, and there’s another small molecule that’s released that helps people concentrate or focus even more.” This could be why you have an easier time focusing on work after going on a lunchtime walk or finishing a morning yoga class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wint said that he’d combine exercise with other activities, too, because “our brains are really made to be moving and to be exploring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to do physical exercise to move, and we want to have lots of social or mental [or] intellectual activity to do that exploration and discovery,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could include learning a new language, cooking a new dish or planting a new garden, Liu explained. “These are all brand-new things to the brain and the body, which will engage different parts of the brain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important that you manage conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, while also getting enough high-quality sleep. Poor sleep puts you at heightened risk for many health issues, &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="including dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67e58578e4b0d06e412d4ebb" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;including dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you notice cognitive changes, talk to a doctor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice changes to your memory, learning or any aspect of your cognition, it’s important to see a doctor sooner rather than later, Liu said, pointing to dementia as an example of a condition that needs attention as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As a measles outbreak in West Texas and New Mexico continues to grow, and other states report outbreaks of their own, some pediatricians across the U.S. say they are seeing a new trend among concerned parents: vaccine enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our call center was inundated with calls about the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine," says &lt;a href="https://pbpediatrics.com/staff/shannon-fox-levine/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Shannon Fox-Levine&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Broward County, Fla. She says parents are asking if their child is up to date on their vaccinations. Or "should they get another vaccine? Should they get an extra one? Can they get it early?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Measles &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/18/1239156786/measles-is-spreading-are-you-safe" target="_blank"&gt;spreads quickly in communities&lt;/a&gt; where vaccination rates are low, and vaccine hesitancy has been on the rise across the U.S. in recent years. Kindergarten &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates &lt;/a&gt;have not bounced back to their pre-pandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Fox-Levine says the recent interest in the MMR vaccine — which protects against measles, mumps and rubella — is a refreshing change in a state where vaccine hesitancy has been growing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Florida's kindergarten vaccination rates to protect against measles&lt;a href="https://www.wusf.org/health-news-florida/2025-01-13/fewer-florida-kids-getting-routine-vaccinations" target="_blank"&gt; fell to 88.1% in the 2023-2024 school year&lt;/a&gt; — below the 95% vaccination rate considered necessary to protect against outbreaks. So, seeing a demand for vaccines is "exciting," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Five U.S. states are currently experiencing measles outbreaks — New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas, which has the most cases by far, with &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;400 confirmed cases as of Friday&lt;/a&gt;. So far this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. has reported more than 480 measles &lt;/a&gt;cases in 20 states. That's more cases than in all of 2024. Almost all of the cases are in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parents are watching what's happening with these outbreaks and concern about potential exposure is growing.  Before the measles vaccine was developed in the early 1960s, the disease &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;used to kill hundreds of people &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S. every year.  &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In Southern Pines, N.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://sandhillspeds.com/staff/christoph-diasio-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Christoph Diasio&lt;/a&gt; says he's had many conversations in recent weeks with families who are interested in getting their children vaccinated against measles earlier than what's usually recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months of age, with a second dose administered between the ages of 4 and 6 years. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20children%20get%20two,date%20on%20their%20MMR%20vaccination." target="_blank"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; says infants as young as 6 months old can receive the MMR vaccine if they are traveling abroad or are in an outbreak area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diasio says families with children younger than 12 months are requesting the shot early, especially if they have travel plans for spring break.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Several families have asked what our game plan is if we get measles in our community," Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some cases, Diasio says, his patient families have delayed travel plans until their children are old enough to receive the MMR shot.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The main thing I'm hearing from my patients is not, 'Oh, my gosh, I'm so scared of that measles vaccine. It's more like, can I have one? Should I get an extra?" Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says one mother he spoke with recently was worried about the potential that unvaccinated relatives could contract measles while flying cross-country to visit her. "It's awful that this is now a discussion we have to have," Diasio says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Interest in vaccinations has ramped up ahead of the spring break travel season, says &lt;a href="https://pediatricpartners.pediatrust.com/Our-Team/Susan-Sirota,-MD" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Susan Sirota&lt;/a&gt;, a primary care pediatrician in the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have many patients calling us because they are traveling to either Texas or places near Texas, or states where they suspect that vaccination rates are lower than we have in Illinois," Sirota says. "Many families are requesting early MMR [vaccines]."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreaks are driving interest in vaccinations, Sirota says they're not the only factor at play. She says many families she works with follow the news, and they worry that vaccines may become less accessible in the future now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281452/trump-cabinet-picks-rfk-confirmation-hearing-help-committee" target="_blank"&gt; a longtime critic of vaccines,&lt;/a&gt; is the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"What I'm seeing is that there's a bit of fear among moms and dads and parents about their ability to protect their children and to prevent diseases because vaccine access is in question for them," Sirota says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it's not just the measles vaccine. Sirota says some patients are worried about access to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; which protects against human papillomavirus.  HPV is best known for causing cervical cancer, but can also cause other malignancies, including cancer of the throat and anus. Kennedy has been involved in legal challenges to that vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he wouldn't take vaccines away from anyone. He has called vaccines a personal choice. NPR reached out to HHS for comment about their plans to maintain people's access to vaccines. They did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's too soon to tell whether anecdotal reports of vaccine enthusiasm will help counter longer-term trends toward growing vaccine hesitancy. According to one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38806351/" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, 1 in 5 U.S. parents are now hesitant about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And studying changes in these attitudes may be harder in the future: The National Institutes of Health has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;terminated millions of dollars worth of grants&lt;/a&gt; for research to study vaccine hesitancy and how to improve immunization levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edited by Jane Greenhalgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            “Kids! Are one of you taking my lorazepams?” Victoria Ratliff (played by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/entertainment/parker-posey-white-lotus/index.html"&gt;Parker Posey&lt;/a&gt;) asks her children in a scene from this season’s “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/24/entertainment/white-lotus-season-3-episode-6-recap/index.html"&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0007356msg65twik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just had my prescription filled, and I can tell some are missing,” she says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0008356mlkc48nzb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By this point in the series, the viewer knows that it’s not her children Victoria needs to worry about, it’s her husband, Timothy (Jason Isaacs).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0009356mc3h3ka75@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just one episode earlier, Victoria tells Timothy that he looks tired and should take a nap (as we know, it’s actually crippling anxiety due to events unfolding at home). She offers him a pill from her prescription bottle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000c356ms6zap0w0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re not addictive. I just take them when I need it,” she says. “You make fun of me, but they work. Not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000d356mq1an4syq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682053.html" target="_blank"&gt;lorazepam&lt;/a&gt; is actually a big deal; it’s a powerful &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/factsheets/benzodiazepines" target="_blank"&gt;benzodiazepine&lt;/a&gt; used to treat anxiety disorders. And although it can be a very effective medication, it should be taken only as prescribed by a doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000e356moh5687cf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What else do you need to know about this scene-stealing drug? I asked &lt;a href="https://drgailsaltz.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, who serves as a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at &lt;a href="https://www.nyp.org/locations/newyork-presbyterian-weill-cornell-medical-center" target="_blank"&gt;New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, to share her expertise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000f356mwjgsgc0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Our conversation has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000g356mret9tp9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to being a big fan of the show, you’re a doctor who prescribes this very medication. What did you think when you first saw it enter the storyline?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000h356mdg5fhoq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Gail Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; I thought, “Wow, people get their information about psychiatric care – and all medical care – from watching shows like this, and I really hope they get it right.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000i356mq44sggnf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is lorazepam right for, and how does it work?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000j356mjj2koqf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Lorazepam is in the class of medications called benzodiazepines, which is a depressant, and also sometimes referred to as a sedative hypnotic medication. It works by increasing a neurotransmitter in your brain called GABA, and that is what makes it somewhat sedating, which is a primary focus of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000k356mhuv85ac4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is often used to treat short-term high anxiety or panic – panic attacks, specifically – and even sometimes short-term sleep difficulty.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000l356mnkvbzawa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Benzodiazepines across the board are highly addictive, both physiologically and psychologically, meaning that one, over time, develops a tolerance to this drug. And so the effects that you do initially get – “I have less anxiety” – will, with the same dose, wane, and you will require more of that medication to have the same effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000m356mw8utnlq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What sorts of things do people with a lorazepam prescription need to keep in mind when they’re taking this drug?&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000n356mymlb6i2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; They need to know the physical effects of this drug, which matter in terms of their safety:
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/list/instances/cm8q8ybe50020356mkun1h6k6@published" class="list " data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
  &lt;ul data-editable="items" class="list__items list__items--ul"&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Sedation:&lt;/strong&gt; You probably shouldn’t drive a car or operate any heavy machinery.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Loss of motor control:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, machinery, driving.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Muscle relaxation:&lt;/strong&gt; In the world of anxiety, this is a good thing, but something to be aware of.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            &lt;strong&gt;Dizziness:&lt;/strong&gt; Take your first dose in a safe place with someone around, to make sure you’re steady and not a fall risk on this medication.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
      
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="list__item inline-placeholder"&gt;
        
            They need to be aware that if taken in large doses – essentially an overdose – you can have what’s called &lt;strong&gt;respiratory depression&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning you stop breathing.
        
      &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q88zlx001k356mt34ymq08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why this drug can be dangerous if you take too much or – and this is very important – take it with other medications that cause central nervous system sedation, such as alcohol, opiates, barbiturates, sleeping pills and even some old-style antihistamines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000p356mo06mpg42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the potential for abuse with lorazepam? What are the risks?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000q356mxs1t0ixj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re taking this for anxiety, for example, as we see in the show – and I would say that Victoria appears to be taking it for social anxiety, when she’s going to go have to be with other people – which is different than Timothy, who is just flooded and in a state of utter traumatic panic and is just popping them indiscriminately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000r356mvvmtaa54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you have a positive response, that is what makes a drug psychologically addictive, which is not physiologically addictive. It’s not dangerous, but what it does do is make you want to take more, right? Because anxiety feels bad – really bad – and when you can take a medication that makes you relax and not experience the anxiety, it’s positively reinforcing. Of course you’d want to take that medication again. It made you feel better.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000s356mua8k512t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Is there anyone who would not be a good candidate for a lorazepam prescription?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000t356mkjzvxj7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, people who need one of these cross-reactive medications that you’re genuinely concerned about the sedative effects. Somebody who is abusing alcohol. Somebody who is abusing other drugs or has really struggled with sobriety, with serious addiction. We try to find ways around prescribing other addictive medication, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000u356mud7l3g05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Victoria is keenly aware of how many pills she has – or is supposed to have. Is this a more complicated prescription to get or fill than, say, antibiotics?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000v356m5xabzqum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz: &lt;/strong&gt;Absolutely. It’s considered a controlled substance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000w356m4ox3gzpj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Generally, physicians can prescribe lorazepam, but it is a different level of prescription where the doctor can’t just call it in on the phone. They are going to look at how many they’re prescribing you, as well as if – and how many – refills they would offer you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000x356msibrvoyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kind of like we do with opioids, if a patient is blowing through them faster than anticipated via the prescription, there needs to be discussion with the patient of, “Why? Where did that go? What is happening? Do you legitimately need more? OK, maybe this is an underdosing. Let’s discuss that. What symptoms are you having? Or are you heading toward tolerance?” And we have to think about what to do here.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000y356msulynyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; During another scene in the show, we see Timothy taking these pills while drinking heavily. That can lead to very serious interactions, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz000z356mw7jpb29x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, yes. Alcohol specifically interacts with benzodiazepines. They both affect the GABA system. They both can cause, on their own, respiratory depression and death – meaning you stop breathing and die. But together, they are what’s called synergistic, meaning it makes each of them have more of that effect than the two of them on their own. So it’s dangerous. That’s why they tell you not to drink when you’re taking lorazepam.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0010356m5rh9fza7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So yeah, he’s pounding them. And you know, it would not be a plot twist that Timothy doesn’t wake up in the morning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0011356mhv2b5xf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By the way, you see Victoria – after her lorazepam disappears, because Timothy has swiped it altogether – now drinking a lot more. And that is probably because, in addition to being stressed about [spoiler redacted], she doesn’t have the medication to cover her, so she’s drinking.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0012356m5ap8w9g8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; In the same episode, Timothy steals a security guard’s gun that he forgot to lock up – and later we see him seriously contemplate suicide. While we aren’t inside (show creator, writer and director) &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/entertainment/mike-white-career-white-lotus/index.html"&gt;Mike White&lt;/a&gt;’s head, is suicidal ideation a known potential side effect of this drug, or do you think this is more likely the result of everything else Timothy is going through?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0013356mh0qh2hje@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; Lorazepam by itself does not cause suicidal ideation, but it is disinhibiting – meaning thoughts that might come into your mind, that you might go, “Oh, no, no, no. I don’t want that thought. Can’t have that thought,” and I push it away. Your ability to suppress it is really not there. So whatever thoughts you’re having would be disinhibited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0014356mmcpvxhv5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Timothy’s situation, all by itself, would cause depression. Depression drives suicidal ideation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0015356mwdsjesvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another feature of lorazepam that is adding to that is basically poor cognitive functioning. Lorazepam literally slows your thoughts. It’s called thought deceleration. And in slowing your thoughts, your ability to problem-solve – which he clearly needs right now – is impaired. And so he is probably feeling like he cannot think his way out of anything right now, and this is a very dire situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0016356mhbaptcor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Now that Timothy has stolen Victoria’s entire prescription bottle, is she going to experience any withdrawal symptoms? What does that look like?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8q7w9sz0017356me1e1cipi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; The question will be, how frequently was Victoria taking this lorazepam? Was this a prescription that was basically like, “Here are 30 lorazepam for the month”?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If she knows, “I’m going to dinner and I have to be at a resort and socialize with other people, and this makes me feel panicky, I can take a lorazepam for the dinner, and I’ll be OK,” but she’s not taking it during the day or any other time, she’s probably not addicted. She’s probably OK from a physiologic standpoint.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If someone who is taking lorazepam more regularly abruptly stops this medication after they are tolerant to it or addicted – which can be a matter of just a couple weeks – you can have a spike in blood pressure. You can have a whole host of very miserable flu-like feelings, confusion, and actually, these things can rise to the level of causing death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It’s a very serious medication to be aware of its easy abuse potential, even in a person who has no intention of abusing it. We have yet to see in the plot whether that will come to pass, but it is something I as a psychiatrist have been concerned about as I watch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Some people, in consultation with their doctor, will absolutely benefit from a lorazepam prescription. But not everyone with anxiety needs this medication. What are some other tried-and-true ways to manage anxiety?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; If you struggle with anxiety, there are a lot of coping tools that you can build into your day that will help you manage it and not get to the level of an anxiety disorder. Those run the gamut from things like a regular practice of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/07/health/breathing-stress-relief-calm-wellness/index.html"&gt;paced deep breathing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/11/health/progressive-muscle-relaxation-mindfulness-wellness/index.html"&gt;progressive muscle relaxation&lt;/a&gt;, 30 minutes of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/health/exercise-stress-heart-disease-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; a day with your heart rate up, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness/index.html"&gt;talking to somebody&lt;/a&gt; about whatever you’re anxious about. That could be someone supportive in your world. That could be a therapist. I always say that should be your first stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; A main character dies at the end of every season of “The White Lotus.” Do you want to go on the record with who you think is going to die this season? Just two episodes left!

            &lt;strong&gt;Saltz:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know why I’m even saying this exactly. It’s just some general gestalt feeling. But I feel this sad feeling like, what’s the name of Rick’s girlfriend again? Chelsea! She’s the one character that maybe I can feel some compassion for on the show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Chelsea is sort of a lost soul, decent person – seemingly, so far, right? Bad things keep happening to Chelsea, and she’s heralding that this really has meaning to her. She’s anticipating bad things. And so, I don’t know if they’re foreshadowing her in that way, but for me, it’s resonating as, you know – they never take out the truly horrendous people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Across three experiments, researchers found that people who scored high on narcissism—often associated with entitlement and self-centeredness—were less likely to cheat or lie after receiving a psychological “inoculation” that made unethical justifications seem less persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Daniel N. Jones of the University of Nevada, Reno, were interested in exploring a new approach to ethical training, particularly for individuals who are more prone to dishonesty but still care about maintaining a positive self-image. Rather than relying solely on traditional codes of ethics, the team investigated whether an “inoculation” strategy could protect against the rationalizations that often lead to unethical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a concept called “moral disengagement”—the psychological process by which people justify unethical behavior in a way that allows them to avoid feeling guilty. Examples include telling yourself that “everyone else does it,” or minimizing the harm done by saying “nobody really gets hurt.” These rationalizations act like self-persuasion, allowing people to maintain a sense of integrity even as they engage in dishonest acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the inoculation method is to warn people that they will encounter such justifications and then expose them to weakened versions of these arguments, along with counterarguments. Much like a vaccine works by training the body to resist a virus, this psychological inoculation helps the mind build up defenses against future unethical reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this approach, the researchers conducted three separate experiments involving a total of 972 participants. In each study, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. One group read a standard code of ethics—a type of message commonly used in schools and workplaces to promote ethical behavior. The other group read an inoculation message designed to expose and counter common rationalizations for unethical conduct. Each message took about two to four minutes to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code of ethics emphasized the importance of upholding integrity in academic and professional environments. It encouraged people to act with honesty, accountability, and responsibility, and to serve as ethical role models for others by resisting temptation, taking ownership of one’s actions, and promoting a culture of ethical behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inoculation message, in contrast, warned that unethical behavior, even when it seems harmless or justified, can damage reputations and lead to serious consequences. It explained several common rationalizations people use to excuse bad behavior—such as blaming others, minimizing harm, or using euphemistic language—and countered each one to help individuals resist these faulty justifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, which involved 443 Canadian university students, participants completed a series of personality assessments and answered questions about how likely they were to engage in dishonest behavior in the future. The researchers specifically measured narcissism using two different tools, along with assessments of Machiavellianism and psychopathy. The key finding was that individuals who scored high on narcissism reported stronger ethical intentions after reading the inoculation message, compared to those who read the standard code of ethics. This effect did not appear for those low in narcissism, nor did it appear for individuals high in Machiavellianism or psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study, which included 224 American business students, took things a step further by measuring actual dishonest behavior. Participants were given a virtual coin-flipping task where they could cheat to earn extra exam credit. If they flipped the coin once and accepted the result, they were considered honest. However, the software allowed them to flip multiple times until they got a favorable outcome. The researchers found that narcissistic participants who received the inoculation were less likely to cheat than those who received the ethics code. Again, no such pattern emerged for the other two traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third study followed 305 participants over time to see whether the inoculation had lasting effects. Participants completed the same kind of initial reading task and were then contacted a week later to report how many lies they had told in the past week. The results showed that individuals high in narcissism who had received the inoculation reported fewer lies, suggesting that the intervention had some durability. Interestingly, this delayed effect was tied more to reductions in dishonest behavior than increases in self-reported honesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all three studies, the inoculation approach consistently influenced only those high in narcissism. The researchers argue that this makes sense given what is known about narcissistic individuals. People high in narcissism often feel entitled and are motivated by personal gain, but they also care deeply about how they are perceived by others and want to maintain a positive self-image. This internal conflict makes them more likely to rely on rationalizations when they behave unethically—and more receptive to an intervention that targets those rationalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, individuals high in psychopathy often lack guilt or concern for others and are unlikely to experience internal conflict about their actions, while those high in Machiavellianism may see dishonesty as a strategic tool rather than something to justify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers caution that the inoculation approach is not universally effective. In fact, they found evidence that it might backfire for people who are already internally motivated to be honest or who score low on narcissism. In these cases, exposure to the inoculation message—which highlights common rationalizations—might inadvertently increase awareness of justifications for unethical behavior, even if that wasn’t the intended effect. The same unintended effect was found among participants with low internal motivation to be honest. For these individuals, the inoculation message seemed to prompt more dishonesty compared to the ethics code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that a one-size-fits-all approach to ethics training may not be optimal. Instead, ethical interventions might need to be customized based on personality traits and motivational factors. People who are already motivated to be ethical may benefit more from standard reminders and ethical codes, while those who struggle with self-serving tendencies—but still care about being seen as good people—may respond better to inoculation messages that challenge their ability to justify dishonest behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this research, we found that individuals high in narcissism behaved more ethically when they were exposed to inoculation that prevented them from engaging in moral disengagement tactics,” the researchers concluded. “This finding was exclusive to narcissism and did not apply to the other two Dark Triad traits. Furthermore, the benefits of inoculation seemed exclusive to narcissism, such that those low in narcissism were not more ethical in response to inoculation. In such cases (i.e., high dispositional ethics) merely repeating a code of ethics may be the best approach. Thus, we find not only does inoculation depend on the target audience in this context, but also that individuals high in narcissism may behave ethically under the right circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672241276562" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Inoculating Against Moral Disengagement Creates Ethical Adherence for Narcissism&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Daniel N.

A test ordered by a veterinarian came back positive for bird flu. Within days, Kira’s condition had deteriorated — she became lethargic and had trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After several trips to the vet and emergency room in Portland, Oregon, where Hanson lives, he made the painful decision to put Kira down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She was the happiest cat I’ve ever had,” he said. “You’d walk past her and she’d do a little back flip and get on her back so you could rub her belly. She did that in the hospital the last night… She just very lethargically flopped on her back so we could rub her belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The manufacturer of the pet food, Wild Coast Pet Foods, subsequently &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/voluntary-recall-wild-coast-raw-boneless-free-range-chicken-formula-raw-pet-food-because-possible" target="_blank"&gt;recalled lots of the formula&lt;/a&gt; Kira had consumed due to potential bird flu contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hanson filed a lawsuit against the company earlier this month, alleging that it had failed to disclose the risk of bird flu in its raw pet food. He is seeking roughly $8,000 to cover the cost of Kira’s veterinary bills. Wild Coast did not respond to a request for comment. In &lt;a href="https://wildcoastpets.com/wild-coast-safety-steps-for-h5n1/" target="_blank"&gt;a letter to customers&lt;/a&gt;, the company said it had “transitioned to fully cooked poultry recipes to eliminate any potential risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-kira-hospital-ew-502p-c7d9a1.jpg" alt="Tim Hanson’s cat Kira in the hospital."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Tim Hanson’s cat Kira in the hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Tim Hanson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the U.S. Agriculture Department, 126 domestic cats in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank"&gt;have been infected with bird flu&lt;/a&gt; since 2022. Around half of those cases were recorded this year, and many were exposed through food or milk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We see continued reports of cats with bird flu infection from across the country, and it’s kept increasing in the past months,” said Suresh Kuchipudi, professor of infectious diseases and microbiology at University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In cats, bird flu tends to be swift and lethal. Although the overall risk to indoor cats is low, Kuchipudi and other experts who study or diagnose the infections say the threat is mounting. With bird flu spreading rampantly among poultry and cattle, there is a constant opportunity for the virus to enter the raw food supply. And while there’s no evidence yet that cats can transmit bird flu to people, the potential increases as more cats get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t have the evidence, but it doesn’t mean that it may not have happened, or it can’t happen,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;At least 3 pet food recalls in 4 months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most pet food is heated to a high enough temperature to kill pathogens before it’s packaged, but bird flu can linger in raw food if it’s sourced from infected poultry — for instance, from chickens that were culled due to an outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The animals that were depopulated could potentially have ended up in the food chain for pets,” said Laura Goodman, an assistant professor at Cornell University’s Baker Institute for Animal Health. “It’s not uncommon for substandard meat to end up in the pet food chain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the last four months, at least three pet food manufacturers have recalled batches containing raw poultry. The Food and Drug Administration in January &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/cat-and-dog-food-manufacturers-required-consider-h5n1-food-safety-plans" target="_blank"&gt;warned manufacturers using uncooked meat&lt;/a&gt; to reassess their food safety plans in light of the recent cat illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Other cats have been exposed to bird flu on dairy farms, likely from drinking raw milk from infected cows. And in some instances, outdoor cats have picked up the virus directly from dead birds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm#contribAff" target="_blank"&gt;report in February&lt;/a&gt; also described two indoor cats that lived with dairy farm workers and contracted bird flu. The research suggests that “individuals who are working on dairies or hauling milk have the potential to carry virus into their house on their clothing or on their shoes, and in turn the cats then are exposed,” said Kimberly Dodd, dean of the Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine, who coauthored the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There is no active surveillance for bird flu in healthy cats, so cases could be underreported. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11528901/#sec26" target="_blank"&gt;study of stray cats&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherlands found that nearly 12% were positive for bird flu antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We may be only testing the sickest cats or one cat from a household. It’s very likely that there have been many cases out there that the cat was not brought to a veterinarian or testing wasn’t done,” said Kristy Pabilonia, director of veterinary diagnostic laboratories at Colorado State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pabilonia oversaw the diagnostic testing for a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/hairless_leo/" target="_blank"&gt;hairless cat named Leonardo DiCaprio&lt;/a&gt;, who was found to have bird flu in January. Leo’s owner, Steve Werfelmann, said his cat had eaten chicken-based raw pet food from the company Savage Pet, which &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/savage-pet-recalls-savage-cat-food-chicken-large-and-small-boxes-because-possible-bird-flu-health?fbclid=IwY2xjawJJx4hleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHUGDboc0G0uQ72RfJYtFDWs67vQGhADUsWqPNkQWjIBCbssoHvywlAjrdA_aem_pwkkhTKW7ScKMDWox9C35A" target="_blank"&gt;recalled dozens of batches&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Leo-Steve-Werfelmann-ew-503p-14c0eb.jpg" alt="Steve Werfelmann's cat Leo."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Steve Werfelmann's cat Leo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Steve Werfelmann&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When we adopted him, that was the recommended food” for his skin, Werfelmann said. “But then talking to the vet and going through this process, they actually told us there’s no real scientific evidence to back up raw food being better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Savage Pet referred NBC News to &lt;a href="https://savagecatfood.com/avian-influenza/" target="_blank"&gt;an online statement&lt;/a&gt;, which says “all of our poultry ingredients are USDA inspected and passed for human consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The current bird flu strain, which began spreading among wild birds and poultry in the U.S. in 2022, often causes severe neurological symptoms in cats, such as seizures and blindness, as well as difficulty breathing and discharge from the eyes and nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Cats may be seen circling or having a head tilt or just acting very abnormally. Some of those clinical signs are very similar to what we see in rabies,” Dodd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Leo didn’t show neurological symptoms, aside from wobbliness in his back legs, Werfelmann said. Instead, his main symptoms were fever, lethargy and not eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We thought he was going to die,” Werfelmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Colorado Department of Agriculture announced this month that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/coloradoag/photos/colorado-has-detected-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai-h5n1-in-11-domestic/1180459680757615/" target="_blank"&gt;11 domestic cats there&lt;/a&gt; had gotten bird flu from raw poultry or pet food. Leo was the only one to survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘It’s the milk’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists are still trying to understand what makes bird flu so deadly in cats. The virus is highly fatal to birds but seems to affect cats more severely than some other mammals. Far fewer cases have been recorded in dogs, and though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly 1,000 dairy herds have been affected&lt;/a&gt;, the disease tends to be milder in cows. In people, only one of the 70 cases recorded in the U.S. has been fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kuchipudi’s &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2024.2440498#abstract" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has identified receptors throughout cats’ bodies that allow them to be infected by a broad range of flu viruses, including H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When you examine these animals, the virus is everywhere in the body,” he said. “It causes a systemic infection that is potentially very severe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Joseph Journell lost two of his cats, Alexander and Tuxedo, to bird flu just days apart in November. He had been giving them raw milk, believing it to contain extra nutrients. A third cat, Big Boy, also got sick after drinking the milk and wound up in critical condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-Big-Boy-Cleopatra-Joseph-Journell-ew-504p-dd3c35.jpg" alt="Joseph Journell's cats, including Big Boy, left."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Joseph Journell's cats, including Big Boy, left.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joseph Journell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I said, ‘Whatever’s wrong with Big Boy is the same thing wrong with Tuxsie and then obviously the same thing wrong with Alexander,’” said Journell, who lives in San Bernardino, California. “It’s the milk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Big Boy tested positive for bird flu via a urine sample in December. He has since recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The milk the three cats consumed came from a California dairy farm called Raw Farm LLC, according to Journell’s lawyer. The farm &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bird-flu-detected-second-lot-raw-milk-sold-california-health-officials-rcna182152" target="_blank"&gt;issued a recall&lt;/a&gt; after California health officials said samples were positive for bird flu. The farm did not respond to NBC News’ request for comment, but in &lt;a href="https://rawfarmusa.com/blog/recall-was-unfounded-and-is-now-lifted" target="_blank"&gt;an online statement&lt;/a&gt; last month, it said the recall had been “unfounded” and that there was “no evidence of adulterated product connecting to any consumer illness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250328-cats-drink-raw-milk-ac-723p-f16ab0.jpg" alt="cat cats feline raw milk"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Big Boy and Alexander drink raw milk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Joseph Journell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Like Hanson in Oregon, Journell decided to pursue legal action. His lawyer sent a letter in January to the owner of Raw Farm, indicating Journell’s intent to recoup more than $16,000 in veterinary expenses, lost wages and caretaker fees for Big Boy. They hope to mediate the situation with the company outside of court but plan to file suit if that’s not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;A threat to humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the veterinary office learned about Kira’s raw food diet, Hanson said, they suspected bird flu right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They immediately put on their PPE,” Hanson said. “I was taken aback.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Although there’s some evidence that cats can pass bird flu to each other, there’s no evidence so far that they have transmitted the virus to people. However, the more the virus spreads in cats, the more opportunities it has to mutate and get better at spreading to humans. Outdoor cats, in particular, could serve as a transmission “bridge” between wild animals and domestic pets or humans, Kuchipudi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vet-catches-bird-flu-cat-new-york-n699316" target="_blank"&gt;a veterinarian at a New York City animal shelter&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for a different strain of bird flu, H7N2, after contact with sick cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We need to be aware of these ongoing circulations that could potentially complicate the disease transmission and also [pose] a risk to human health,” Kuchipudi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hanson said he was tested for bird flu after Kira died and was negative. In his cat’s final days, he said, he wore an N95 mask around her and washed his clothes upon returning home from the animal hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He hopes his story will serve as a warning to other cat owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I don’t want any more cats dying,” he said. “Hopefully people can learn from Kira’s passing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE96cER2UzAxN1JuaVhkWGRoV0NMUTJyNmxNLXFhckZ0eWpIRk5SbC1UOV9OLVBwdmhVekxFWkcxVTFVZGpkQXFlV05KbzR3czRXRXdORGJjQV84TkY5R1RCX1YyRDBrcUZsek1nandHcVJZM1hWMFHSAVZBVV95cUxOTDNlU05mM2RsaHl2aWZEdUlIeTFfR2F1dXo2eDJPNXREZDhIYlZUNHlsMDVQRHl2UEZyaWk4VXhBNWNwX1ZuSTFjb2g1U09Pc3BJNlBJUQ</guid></item><item><title>Avoid sugary soda, play pickleball, eat peanut butter and jelly — plus 10 more health tips to help you have a great week - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPU1BJM0F6V3hEVXp4UkFPWnpoNzlfaHdsOWxRRFBsVWFuUFdUWXFXa3IxZ2dnMXZ0OTI2S21ZNXpNQ1E0RVVGZC1ZMmVLTXBMUm16ZFZXY0Rid3pNbVY2T0dEX0JobjZBUEpUUXZYZEVkUmRGNUF6M0NjcUVkSHB5ZXpYNUxycUtiUUNRS0dqQ1AwNFlxU0QwV0ozN1A0WkZfSklhZWFwOURySTZWNWlXdTFseERmbW9Tb2pSZ1VvQzlNZXFyc2tobU81ZHJfU3lhZmI5RXB3SjRjS1EwNHJXcWlTNTA3Yi04VjRveHIwYjhmM1poZDhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hello, Yahoo Life readers!

One recommendation from my ophthalmologist, however, is providing serious relief: resting with a warmed eye mask. Doing so helps by unclogging blocked oil glands in the eyelids, which improves tear quality to moisten your peepers. It also gives a 20-minute couch nap major spa vibes.

However, unlike sugar, it does not trigger hormones that signal fullness, potentially leading to increased hunger, cravings and a higher risk of overeating and weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consider swapping sucralose-rich snacks for naturally sweet options like fruit.

            When health workers stopped visiting her home in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/asia/pakistan-balochistan-train-hostage-wednesday-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; to administer &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/health/tuberculosis-outbreak-kansas/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; medication, Ratna Jamni began dragging herself to a clinic “step by painful step, when even standing feels impossible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhlsk0002356mlympy5wx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 40-year-old had been receiving treatment and mental health support for months at home after contracting drug-resistant TB, but those visits have all stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhlsk0003356mmru5vbcq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every trip is painful, exhausting and humiliating. I don’t know how much longer I can do this,” she told CNN via the Dopasi Foundation, a Pakistan-based NGO whose &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/politics/trump-admin-terminates-syria-white-helmets-funding/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;-funded programs helped provide her health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slh4r20000356mt3hs59qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The journey is long, my body is weak, and every breath feels heavier than the last. I wonder if it’s even worth it. I wish this suffering would end – either the help returns or I no longer have to endure this pain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sli0o70009356me4h0lmoq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection usually found in the lungs, remains the world’s top infectious killer,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;causing 1.25 million deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slhyxb0007356me837im0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the right health care and drugs, TB is treatable and preventable. Without treatment, it has a death rate of close to 50%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slicgy000c356md6gyznzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like that of millions of other TB patients across the world, Jamni’s treatment was supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). It has now been interrupted by the Trump administration’s sudden freezing, and subsequent cutting, of vast swathes of the agency’s funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljcl7000h356mloa01qnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aid groups and doctors warn that these cuts are likely to cause thousands of unnecessary deaths and a rise in TB infections worldwide, including in the US itself; and create the conditions for an extremely drug-resistant form of the disease to spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljaf6000f356mpc6g44ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Already, more than 11,000 additional TB patients are estimated to have died in the two months since almost all USAID funding froze on January 24, according to a model built by UN-affiliated organization Stop TB Partnership.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slji1e000k356m6e50bv88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            TB infections are also expected to increase by 28-32% globally this year as a result of the cuts, according to a memo issued by a top USAID official, Nicholas Enrich, who was placed on administrative leave. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljxkf000p356m7dad3rtp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The State Department, which now handles queries for USAID, told CNN that certain TB programs are “active today in more than a dozen countries,” in line “with Secretary (of State Marco) Rubio’s exemption for life-saving humanitarian assistance.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljxkf000q356mp6d5wu2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These programs are helping to find and cure hundreds of thousands of cases of tuberculosis by providing access to low-cost, life-saving testing and medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sljv94000n356m8iu2qiky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US funding was an integral part of the global TB response, distributing grants both directly to 24&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;national governments whose countries have high rates of the disease and via international or local non-governmental organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slkd6g000v356mo3m0kol5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            USAID was deeply enmeshed in global HIV/AIDS health care too, and TB is the leading cause of death for people with HIV, according to WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slkp1t000y356mcsnj42zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike previous changes in funding flows, which came with prior warning, this freeze is unprecedented in both its scale and abruptness, meaning that it’s “very difficult for these countries overnight to find the resources” to plug the gap, Dr. Lucica Ditiu, CEO of the UN-affiliated Stop TB Partnership, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll9gr0013356m6s2byd5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And while local aid groups call for a shift to domestic funding, the situation right now is deteriorating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll9gr0014356m49tdoyq5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the 27 countries worst affected by the cuts, that funding gap is leading to “crippling breakdowns in their TB response with devastating consequences,” WHO said in a statement on March 20.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sll1ry0011356mmz1xm2nj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The precise nature of the impact has varied worldwide, depending on the role USAID played in the network of funding streams contributing to each country’s TB program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slln0i0019356miff8tjhv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In almost half of Mozambique, for example, no one can currently be diagnosed with TB, since US funding supported its lab networks and system that transported samples of spit and mucus, Ditiu said. Some programs, like Stop TB Partnership’s Global Drug Facility, which facilitates global access to relatively cheap drugs, have had some funding restored by temporary waivers, Ditiu said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sllky80017356mjuscco4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But more have not, and nine countries are struggling to procure TB drugs, threatening patients’ access to them, WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slluu8001c356m2kqxndvx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health workers based in Cambodia, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa and Eswatini told CNN the biggest cuts to their programs were mostly in active case-finding, which allows for earlier diagnosis to stem the spread of disease, and in community outreach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slm9cq001h356mlnxnu2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One such USAID-funded program in Cambodia, run by local HIV and TB organization KHANA, had screened more than 780,000 people for TB in remote areas, traced more than 16,000 close contacts of TB patients and supported more than 800 patients with multi-drug-resistant TB during the past five years, according to its executive director, Choub Sok Chamreun.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slm43r001f356mwjdmteuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All that work has now stopped. As a result, the number of new TB cases reported in the region has dropped from about 650-850 per month to just 250 in February, meaning that hundreds are going undiagnosed and without care, Chamreun told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slmfz9001k356mga3nnwly@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means that people don’t come to services. It means that the infection continues to spread over the community … it means that the aim to end TB by 2030 is impossible,” he said, referencing the UN’s goal to largely eliminate the disease by the end of the decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sln919001n356m95inns92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similarly, another case-finding program supported by USAID in 27 of Pakistan’s districts has ceased, along with the means of transporting sputum samples, and community monitoring that aims to identify any barriers to TB treatment, Kinz ul Eman, CEO of the Dopasi Foundation, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnqgw001s356mcm4yvid1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sudden cuts also mean immediately laying off field health workers who “actually risked their life to support your project activity, to support their community,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnqgw001t356makt7r4oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            TB disproportionately affects marginalised communities and people living in poverty for whom government health care is less accessible, making such outreach even more important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnkoh001q356mz6yyqs1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One such program, overseen by Dr. Steven John, an official at the Ministry of Health in Adamawa State, Nigeria, was implementing TB health care for nomadic populations there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slo20g001y356mfslcy4dl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the funding freeze, his program can no longer reach the 60-70% of the community who have yet to access its services, even as people there “approach the organization (saying) ‘When are you coming?’” he told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slnw50001w356mnzamp58i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suddenly restricting access to drugs and treatment also creates the conditions for a mutated, multi-drug-resistant strain of TB to thrive as patients partway through a four- or six-month treatment regimen may be forced to stop taking them, aid groups and doctors say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sloqc50025356mn8p8gc71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Anytime you cease a treatment in the middle of the course of therapy, you promote the selection of drug resistance and people then become contagious again to others in their community,” explained Dr. Kenneth Castro, a professor at Emory University who previously served as director of the division for tuberculosis elimination at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slojge0023356mbbdz6xi0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Very few drugs can treat such an extreme form of TB. “You create, basically, a bug which is virtually resistant to what we have,” said Ditiu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002a356m3v4gkfrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That risk is magnified since a lot of USAID’s funding, especially in Africa, focused on supporting people living with multi-drug-resistant TB, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002b356mtt3nwla8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And anecdotal reports of patients stopping their courses of medication are already emerging. One patient in Uganda started sharing her medication with her husband, meaning they are both taking half the prescribed amount, Bruce Tushabe, an official at advocacy group the AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002c356mbj9urm7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another person who used to get medication from a specialist, now-closed clinic can’t stand in the queues at the general clinics due to the stigma TB patients still face, Tushabe added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp3l8002d356mojec29i3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As TB rates rise globally, they are likely to increase in the US as well, said Castro, while pointing out that the country still has one of the world’s lowest rates of the disease at 2.9 cases per 100,000 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8sloss80028356mkunqgsrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonetheless, warning signs are lighting up – in January, the Kansas City metro area was hit by a wave of TB, causing dozens of illnesses and at least two deaths. And childhood TB cases in Europe rose by 10% in 2023, showing that transmission of the disease is still ongoing, WHO said on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8slp68o002g356mj725kj5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The irony,” Castro added, “is that these disinvestments end up resulting at higher cost to recover and mitigate the damage done.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

              &lt;/div&gt;

Tiny and mute beneath the stacked rows of medical students, she is paraded for their benefit by a consultant psychiatrist some 44 years her senior. It is 1966 – the peak of Swinging 60s’ hedonism, liberalism and youthful counterculture – but in a locked psychiatric ward in London’s Royal Waterloo hospital, unspeakable violations are being inflicted upon patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The perpetrator-in-chief, William Sargant, is the subject of thriller writer Jon Stock’s first nonfiction book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-sleep-room-9780349128894/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Sleep Room: A Very British Medical Scandal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. One of the most notorious figures in British psychiatry, Sargant initially wished to be a physician. He pivoted to psychiatry after one of his earliest pieces of research met with a humiliating reception at the Royal College of Physicians, causing him to suffer a nervous breakdown and spend time in a psychiatric hospital himself. At this time – the 1930s – effective psychiatric treatments were virtually non-existent. Serious mental illness usually led to lifelong incarceration in an asylum. But the therapeutic nihilism of psychiatry was shifting towards optimism. Psychiatrists began experimenting with so-called “heroic” therapies, such as putting patients into insulin comas or giving them electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to try to “reset” their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"books","tags":[{"id":"books/scienceandnature","type":"Keyword","title":"Science and nature books"},{"id":"books/series/observer-book-of-the-week","type":"Series","title":"Observer book of the week"},{"id":"books/books","type":"Keyword","title":"Books"},{"id":"society/psychiatry","type":"Keyword","title":"Psychiatry"},{"id":"books/healthmindandbody","type":"Keyword","title":"Health, mind and body books"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"Tone","title":"Reviews"},{"id":"profile/rachel-clarke2","type":"Contributor","title":"Rachel Clarke","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/06/15/Rachel-Clarke.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=51c29f213037939471b9112192dce124","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/06/15/Rachel_Clarke,_R.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=2e37d5bd253b6ea6021f4af2337fa608"},{"id":"publication/theobserver","type":"Publication","title":"The Observer"},{"id":"theobserver/new-review","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"The New Review"},{"id":"theobserver/new-review/books","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Books"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"Tracking","title":"Observer New Review"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"books/2025/mar/30/the-sleep-room-by-jon-stock-a-very-british-medical-scandal-william-sargant-review-a-horrifying-study-of-medical-abuse","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"prebidCriteo":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"abDeferPermutiveLoad":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"abTheTradeDesk":true,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":true,"prebidBidCache":false},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sargant firmly believed that a broken brain was no different to any other damaged organ or limb, and best fixed with aggressive physical treatment. Not for him the namby-pamby chitchat of Freud’s “sofa merchants” and their spurious talking cures. Rather, psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia could all be cured with excessive doses of drugs and electricity, or, if they failed, with surgical lobotomy. Sargant’s patients were sequestered away behind locked doors on the top floor of the hospital. The most infamous part of his ward was a six-bedded area known as the Sleep Room. Here, the patients, nearly all of whom were female, were drugged into long-term stupors, being roused from their beds only to be fed, washed or given innumerable doses of ECT. A typical “narcosis” treatment comprised three months of near-total unconsciousness, after which time the patient had often been reduced to a “walking zombie” with permanent memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Even as someone who learned, as a medical student, about the unspeakable mid-century vogue for lobotomy, some of the accounts made my skin crawl&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sleep Room&lt;/em&gt; is peppered with haunting first-hand accounts of horrific treatment at the hands of William Sargant. The actor Celia Imrie, for example, the aforementioned child, was admitted under Sargant’s care because she was close to death from anorexia nervosa. She recounts being forced to drink such large doses of chlorpromazine – the first antipsychotic - that she dribbled, shook uncontrollably and found her hair in clumps on her pillow. She was injected daily with enough insulin to make her drowsy, weak, sweaty and near comatose. She remembers other women around her having huge rubber plugs jammed between their teeth before the high-voltage electricity of ECT was sent through their temples, and their bodies “shuddered and jerked” with the “scent of burning hair and flesh”. Sometimes a patient would reappear on the ward with their head thickly bandaged, scarcely able to walk after being lobotomised. Amid the moans, screams and stale stench of sleep, Imrie recalls the nurses reporting her own resistance to the drugs to Sargant, to which he ominously responded: “every dog has his breaking point”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;To say that these stories are difficult to read is an understatement. Even as someone who learned, as a medical student, about the unspeakable mid-century vogue for lobotomy – permanently subduing patients by gouging out parts of their frontal lobes – some of the accounts made my skin crawl. It is to Stock’s great credit that he places patient testimony centre stage, allowing several patients to tell their stories at length in their own, unedited words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sargant himself is depicted as a sinister, all-powerful, “simian” monster who ran his ward as a personal fiefdom in which he could pursue, unchecked, his conviction that effective treatments worked by physically erasing and reprogramming disturbed minds. A darker benefit of his Sleep Room was the absolute power it gave him over his charges. Once rendered unconscious, a patient could be subjected to treatments they might otherwise never have consented to, such as scores, or even hundreds, of doses of ECT. As Sargant himself put it: “What is so valuable is that they generally have no memory about the actual length of the treatment or the number of ECT used.” Before long, colleagues had nicknamed him “Bill the Brain Slicer” and “Sargant the Shock”. His fascination with techniques for brainwashing led to speculation that he may have collaborated with the CIA’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MKUltra" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;MKUltra&lt;/a&gt; programme into mind control, though no definitive proof of this is provided by Stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7257b788-1e22-4a45-a5a3-47a0c96d5176" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;The Royal Waterloo hospital for children and women, in London, where Sargant undertook his ‘narcosis’ treatments.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Panoramic Images/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At least five of Sargant’s patients died during narcosis. The dangers of artificially prolonged sleep included deep vein thrombosis, pressure sores, infection and paralysis of the gut, all of which could be fatal. Though the disproportionate number of female patients under his care was not, in itself, evidence of misogyny, his treatment of particular individuals locates him firmly within that psychiatric tradition. He was perfectly willing, for example, to regard female independence as synonymous with madness and in need of social correction. One young woman was dispatched to Sargant by her wealthy businessman father after she fell in love with an “unsuitable” man in the 1960s. Sargant “helped” the situation by subjecting her to months of narcosis, ECT, antipsychotics, antidepressants and the “truth drug”, sodium amytal, after which she was successfully returned to her family with all memories of her boyfriend completely erased. Obedience had been achieved through physical obliteration of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While there is no denying Sargant’s lack of medical ethics, and his authoritarianism and reliance on dogma as opposed to clinical evidence, &lt;em&gt;The Sleep Room&lt;/em&gt; can present him as almost cartoonishly villainous. With eyes “like washed black pebbles”, “sadomasochistic stubbornness” and a “prodigious enthusiasm for pill popping”, he sweeps the wards like a demented demigod, barking orders to terrified staff and patients alike. This portrayal unhelpfully flattens very real and complicated issues over how best to treat serious mental illness. Patient consent – the bedrock of all good medical practice – cannot always be obtained when a patient’s illness means they lack capacity to make decisions for themselves. Even today, with a modern emphasis on the rights of patients, the responsibilities of clinicians and the need for humanity in psychiatry, enforced treatment is sometimes the only way to prevent a severely unwell psychiatric patient harming or killing themselves. ECT, for example, although used much less frequently than in Sargant’s day (and rightly so), can be a life-saving last resort, as in patients with catatonic depression. With more nuance and less condemnation, Stock could have interrogated more richly the complexities of how best to treat disabling and life-threatening psychiatric illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Clarke’s most recent book, &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-story-of-a-heart-9780349145594/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Story of a Heart&lt;/a&gt; (Abacus)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;has been shortlisted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women’s prize for nonfiction 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQaTNKWFd6dlhjamFwRFZpTWx4ZlVteHV5UnJhdXM2WXBqYkRNN1NOMDNUa040NWFrM1dJSTR1RTdvcVJZRTJHaFU5bmZTUzBlMzZBcEpYakNFVW5mRkcyXzNpZmh0cDd1dmxiZEVGLURjUXhtOXVQVGI4WC02X0tTNUV5WW1OZUhxS2JuUjMtMFZoWGpwR0RJQlpWMDFIQ0t1VnJLSVNuOGliTlVnOFNvTUFVdmRBOUIzdk1ZWGtBZnRNSUdsYTB6YzBGS050T0hVaFRleGpsZm5ET3FPcTlRR0FZeXJQUzQxeUlPNTdaTzdUcUhzbXc</guid></item><item><title>I didn't realise how much walking 10,000 steps a day was benefitting my health until I stopped - Fit and Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOMUZGZk02Uml4TVNmVlBSanFFcThaTjY2Y25wUzhtRzlyWlZubmJIclRhaU9Oc3BsQjBLakVETjNIaFl0cExaMmpBZWI3UDhBTnNUanpHeW9QOXl6aDR4NHBWdnZoWW1WS0ZyMjRPc3NmVWpNYVlIZnE4NUt1MGdpTU9iOHVoc0xPdWhnTUlmSjNNWUJucnZ3akpoTXpraEVEVV90blFPTWFQaThPOGFtVk16aUR5RzZxN2tTZ3FVOEhBZ0s1bkhpM0xJN2hsTjBad0lR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were in lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic, I walked more than ever. After all, there wasn't much else to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My daily walks were a revelation: they helped to clear my head, and being up on my feet and outside as much as I was sitting down at my desk or on the couch felt good. Ever since, I have aimed to hit 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew this much walking was benefitting my health—the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Taking%20more%20steps%20a%20day,to%208%2C000%20steps%20per%20day." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Taking%20more%20steps%20a%20day,to%208%2C000%20steps%20per%20day." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; says taking more steps a day can lower your risk of premature death—but I hadn't realised the effect it had on my daily wellbeing until a recent knee injury forced me to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of weeks, I've had to minimize the amount I walk, taking no more than 3,000 steps a day unless I can't avoid it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The change has been jarring and I’ve noticed some immediate negative effects that have reinforced the importance of my daily walking habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the four changes I've noticed since I've reduced my step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-i-m-not-sleeping-as-well"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. I’m not sleeping as well&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I find that one of the biggest benefits of exercise is a good night’s sleep and spending a couple of hours a day walking helps ensure I get some good shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that exercise can improve sleep quality and sleep latency—the time it takes to fall asleep. Since walking less, I've found it more difficult to drift off to sleep and I've had difficulty staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ucws2YkYP6EKKW2ZRkiWBc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ucws2YkYP6EKKW2ZRkiWBc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-i-m-more-restless-and-stressed"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

It's a break from work and the blue light of my screens, and it gives me the space to process my thoughts and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since skipping it for the past couple of weeks, I've felt more stressed and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I don't think that's just down to doing less exercise because I have been keeping up with low-impact exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-i-m-more-bloated"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. I'm more bloated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most unexpected benefits of walking I experience is how it can help with digestion. I tend to go for my walk after eating lunch, which helps my body digest my food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4294172/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4294172/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found that exercise, including walking, can improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and I've noticed that I've been feeling a lot more bloated during the afternoon and evenings since reducing my step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-my-muscles-are-stiffer"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. My muscles are stiffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: RealPeopleGroup / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged sitting can weaken muscles and joints in the hips, and can lead to stiffness in areas including the shoulders and neck. Unfortunately, the time I usually take to walk 10,000 steps has been spent sitting down on my couch instead, which has made my muscles feel particularly stiff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-ok-to-miss-your-step-count-goal-3"&gt;Is it OK to miss your step count goal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though reducing my step count has had these negative effects on my body and mind, it's been the right decision to give my knee time to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it's an injury, a holiday or just a busy schedule, you may find the number of steps you take each day fluctuates and it's not the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to getting back to walking regularly as soon as I can and if you're looking for a simple way to improve your overall health, increasing your step count is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-shop-walking-shoes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shop walking shoes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're in need of a new pair of walking shoes, our guide to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt; can help.

This isn't just a quick snack; it's quite full of nutrition with the presence of various vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.

&lt;p&gt;Local healthcare facilities report being slammed with influenza patients this season, along with people suffering from colds and other respiratory viruses.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, we are seeing much higher rates of flu this year,” said Tina Sary, a nurse practitioner with &lt;a href="https://www.cottagehealth.org/virtual-care/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwtJ6_BhDWARIsAGanmKeDtveZ3m1A2lkvdDJGUc3FZC7eF6hugxYYoxuSyySTFowWKCzW0IMaAt1NEALw_wcB"&gt;Cottage Health’s Virtual Care&lt;/a&gt; program.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cottage Health throughout its system has treated roughly double the number of flu patients compared to last year, Sary told &lt;a href="https://www.noozhawk.com/"&gt;Noozhawk&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The flu season normally starts in October and continues through March, with the peak being from December through February.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone_load_2023671336"&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone place="0" callback="zone_load_2023671336" zone-id="67458" keywords="not_home_page,not_landing_page,is_article_page,local_news,health,influenza-has-put-up-a-nasty-fight-this-season-in-santa-barbara-county,post" soft-keywords="true" zone-alias=""&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The greatest number of cases in Santa Barbara County were recorded in late December and January.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we’re well into March, and we’re still seeing pretty high activity,” Sary noted.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some flu patients are confirmed through laboratory testing, Sary said, while others are assumed to have the disease based on their symptoms and contact with people who have tested positive.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sansum, Marian Seeing Similar Rise in Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sansumclinic.org/"&gt;Sansum Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, part of &lt;a href="https://www.sutterhealth.org/"&gt;Sutter Health&lt;/a&gt;, has experienced a similar flood of influenza cases, according to Dr. Marjorie Newman, chief medical officer.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has been a really difficult flu season, nationally and in Santa Barbara,” Newman said.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, Newsman said, about half the patients who were tested turned out positive for the flu. That has dropped to about 25% in recent weeks, and continues to decline.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the worst season we’ve seen since the (COVID-19) pandemic,” she added.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very young and the elderly are the populations most at risk for serious illness or death from the flu.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Terrance McGovern, director of emergency medicine at &lt;a href="http://www.marianmedicalcenter.org/index.htm"&gt;Marian Regional Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; in Santa Maria, said the number of patients testing positive for influenza within his organizations “essentially doubled from 2023-24 to 2024-25.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu patient profiles have been “across the board,” McGovern said. “But we always worry about the very young and the very old, and we worry about patients with co-morbidities.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s Led to the Surge in Flu Cases?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local health experts say multiple factors likely are responsible for this season’s surge in flu patients.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key one is that fewer people got vaccinated against the flu ahead of this season, Sary said.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be most effective, at least 70% of the population needs to be vaccinated before the peak season, she said, “but this year it’s less than 50% across the state.”

			&lt;/svg&gt;
		&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some estimates put the number nationally at 40-45%.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newman also cited the reduced vaccination rate, and pointed out that influenza cases — and other respiratory illnesses — dropped significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic due to people masking up and social distancing.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One result of that, she said, was that fewer people developed natural immunity by getting sick.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What to Do If You Get the Flu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu for people with severe flu symptoms, and for those at higher risk of serious complications.




&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a 5-day course of pills that can reduce the severity of the flu. But to be most effective, it must be started within 48 hours of symptoms beginning.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to be seen by a doctor that quickly,” Sary said. “That’s where virtual care is really awesome.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sary said Cottage already has experienced more than double the anti-viral therapy compared to the previous season.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most people need to just let the flu run its course. It’s recommended that they stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such patients are advised to get plenty of rest, drink lots of fluids, and take over-the-counter medications — fever and pain relievers, cough suppressants and decongestants — to manage symptoms.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with the flu tend to be most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although some may be contagious for longer periods.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Treatment Options for Flu &amp;amp; Other Ailments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cottage Health’s Virtual Care program is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Patients can go online, fill out a form detailing their symptoms and health information, and receive a treatment plan within minutes.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, they can request a face-to-face video visit with a doctor or nurse practitioner.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost for either is $29, and is covered by some health insurance plans, although not Medicare.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment options also are available through Sansum, &lt;a href="https://sbclinics.org/about/contact-us/"&gt;Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.countyofsb.org/410/Public-Health"&gt;Santa Barbara Public Health Department&lt;/a&gt;, local hospitals including Cottage’s three campuses, Marian and the &lt;a href="http://lompocvmc.com/"&gt;Lompoc Valley Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, and urgent-care centers such as &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/locations/santa-barbara-primary-specialty-care"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to Avoid Getting the Flu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dodging the flu generally comes down to vigilance and good hygiene.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommend getting the flu vaccine in the fall; it’s widely available through medical offices as well as pharmacies. A more potent version is available for people 65 years of age and older.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, masking in crowded indoor locations can help prevent the spread of the flu and other airborne viruses, and frequent hand washing is always a good idea.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, keeping your distance from people you know are sick with the flu is always a good idea.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Tony Wood, GSK's chief scientific officer in San Francisco in 2019 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Adam Finn, a member of the Government's Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation, said there were already plans to extend the roll-out of the shingles jab to all over-60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he added: 'If there is found to be a dementia-preventing effect, that might make it cost-effective to give the vaccine even earlier.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now the biggest study yet is to be launched, comparing the number of dementia diagnoses in people who have had the jab with those in a similarly aged group who have not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sheona Scales, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'It's not yet clear how the shingles vaccine might influence dementia risk, whether through reducing inflammation, boosting overall immune health or other factors,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study could help uncover these mechanisms and provide insights into whether the vaccine may help delay the onset of dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the moment, two doses of Shingrix are offered to adults who turned 65 after September 1, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The trailblazing study will use the data from up to 1.4million NHS patients to test whether its shingles vaccine reduces the risk of the degenerative disease (stock photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The project will seek to confirm if the Shingrix vaccine cuts the risk of dementia compared with an older shingles vaccine, Zostervax, which also has a protective effect (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of supply issues, those who turned 65 before then become eligible only when they turn 70. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has created an ideal scenario for research: two groups of people of similar ages, one of which has received the jab while the other has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Wood said: 'The UK's unique national-scale health data resources provide a significant opportunity for cutting-edge research.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Richard Oakley, associate director of research and innovation at Alzheimer's Society said: 'The age cut-offs have produced a large cohort of individuals whose data can be analysed like a clinical trial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 01:31:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPTlBqVEpYOTlIaXUzaDFxMEhNZnBPd05pNkptSU5SZFVBNDljeElBTFRFVGFpVVJlU0xJUmhFS21iZmg0dHNNYXZVX043Y0ZpRzZubEZwc2JJVjNHWlhhblp3ZDFGZDF4a1lwRUlleHhjNklHWkhjdGdBSmd4cmJSTTlzXzZuc1lIMDhLcnJsYnZwdGhua21tUWVNSTN2dU9B0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5ldk5Qa1Rxam5ka1RsSWhUT0dXb0lJc3lXWmhVcXdWTlVPbU56R3pSNkRMdXRtN0RrNThjb0V2NnkwdHZobFI0MUFjQTY2SzR2SmVlLTVJUHVneEJISGhCZXo5Yk96Y3JwdzhoZE94Sk5jWkQzMENEQ293LXZOQV82c3JPTWtEN3dXY1Z6bk00aDlKaVoyVWVLZjJPeGpPUlNDNzFHUlE</guid></item><item><title>14 People Who Died In The Most Horrifying, Disturbing, And "Please Don't Let This Happen To Me!"

  &lt;p&gt;As Brandes lay bleeding, Meiwes read a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelelbird/funniest-star-trek-jokes"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; novel, periodically checking on him. Hours later, with Brandes drifting in and out of consciousness, Meiwes ended his life by stabbing him in the throat. Over the next 10 months, Meiwes consumed approximately 20 kilograms of Brandes's flesh, storing body parts in his freezer under pizza boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meiwes was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/04/germany.lukeharding" target="_blank"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; in December 2002 after an Austrian student alerted authorities to a new advertisement from Meiwes. Upon searching Meiwes's home, police found body parts and a videotape detailing the entire event. In court, Meiwes said the crime was something he had wanted to do for a long time, adding, "I always had the fantasy and in the end I fulfilled it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was convicted of manslaughter in 2004 and sentenced to eight and a half years, but given life in prison for murder after a 2006 retrial.&lt;/p&gt;

The White House also did not respond to a request for comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies across the nation have helped drive down the incidence of HIV, largely through testing, counseling and the distribution of medications that prevent the spread of the disease. Much of the funding for that work came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" target="_blank"&gt;decline was 12% nationally&lt;/a&gt; between 2018 and 2022, with an even sharper 21% in the 50 local areas where the CDC focused its prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LGBT Center in Los Angeles, which provides outreach, testing and HIV-preventative medications, said it has been left in limbo about what will become of its $450,000 CDC grant to support that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have seen tremendous gains in the fight to end HIV because of the real investments that have been made in prevention and care,” said Joe Hollendoner, CEO of the LGBT Center. “We’ve even been talking about how, in our lifetime, we could end the HIV epidemic and get to zero new cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But if we are terminating HIV prevention contracts in the way that we anticipate ... it is not hyperbole to say it’s going to cost human lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That echoed concerns voiced by DAP Health, which operates 25 clinics in Riverside and San Diego counties, including many in the Coachella Valley, which has a large gay population and where the HIV rate is four times the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This ‘cost-saving’ strategy of decimating the CDC’s HIV prevention program will only increase costs, both human and financial,” David Brinkman, the CEO of DAP Health, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinkman pointed to &lt;a class="link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33492100/" target="_blank"&gt;research that showed the average cost&lt;/a&gt; of lifetime treatment for a patient who contracts HIV to be about $500,000 a year. The estimated potential “savings” of $1.8 billion if the federal disease agency eliminates the HIV program would quickly disappear if more than 3,600 Americans were newly infected, Brinkman said, adding: “And we know the toll of lives impacted by HIV with this slashing will be in the tens of thousands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outspoken voice against a possible reduction or elimination of the anti-HIV program is Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Palm Desert), a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-c1-congressman-ruiz-20140106-m-story.html"&gt;former emergency room doctor who represents the Coachella Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The CDC’s Division of HIV Prevention plays a vital role in reducing new infections, saving billions in preventable health care costs, and ensuring that individuals can access life-saving medication,” Ruiz said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruiz noted that the CDC program also plays a central role in responding to viral hepatitis and TB. The congressman joined 100 other Democrats in the House and Senate in sending a letter to President Trump, urging him to reconsider any plan to reduce or eliminate the disease prevention program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers reminded Trump that during his first term, in 2019, he declared the goal of ending the HIV epidemic. “One of the pillars of your initiative, as shown on CDC’s website, is prevention,” the letter said. “It is imperative that you uphold this commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C.J. Tobe, chief transformation officer for DAP Health, said the Trump administration’s potential change of course seemed inexplicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a 180-degree turn, to threaten to take this away,” Tobe said. “It feels personal and it makes zero sense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusion and turmoil have also enveloped U.S. government-supported research around HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CNN reported this week that the National Institutes of Health had eliminated funding for dozens of HIV-related research grants. The news outlet cited a Department of Health and Human Services database and quoted scientists who said the cuts would also deal a crippling blow to the goal of ending HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those on the chopping block were grants related to PrEP, the regimen of drugs that can thwart HIV infection, scientists told the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for intervention against the disease overseas also appeared endangered when the Trump administration froze foreign aid and then all but eliminated the U.S. Agency for International Development, the main American agency for delivering assistance to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanhiv/article/PIIS2352-3018(25)00074-8/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;A study published in the Lancet&lt;/a&gt; said that a reduction in support from the U.S. and other major funding countries could lead to 4.4 million to 10.7 million new HIV infections worldwide by 2030, killing 770,000 to nearly 3 million more people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unmitigated funding reductions could significantly reverse progress in the HIV response by 2030, disproportionately affecting sub-Saharan African countries and key and vulnerable populations,” the study said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Mar 2025 19:35:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQUU83LS01SGFkVlp1akswVEJUenpWR1ZfZlVhOGhnM3lrZGVjT3I5M01fYkEtYUxNaGFRWU5vV05oN09zdGpGaklCYldTYWlxNzFkUVh0YXg0dWRqWTZaeWlUcC1XUmdQTm85LXpQZ1RpaW9MUjBMYktDLXc3TnA0QWUyU3ozRzBfM3M1RQ</guid></item><item><title>Healthy eating habits in midlife may prevent chronic illness in later years, research finds - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE03YmVRbjc3NVZsVTcwYks5YTFlZ0hoVU1jaWhnSmJHVDR2M2Q4YUlUT3ExRld2eHRhM0NVN1RiTWFzT01icy1DQUNSNFB2MFk0NUs4a1QtWHJELUc3MHFYRnF4aXRVVk9vWWR4X1pCaG82akY2UjBF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A new study released;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;A new study released&lt;/a&gt; this week by researchers reveals that eating a diet rich in plant-based foods with a low to moderate intake of meat can help stave off chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by the T.H.
