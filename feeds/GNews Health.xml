            A vaccine used to treat &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/06/australia/australia-koala-chlamydia-intl-dst-hnk"&gt;chlamydia&lt;/a&gt; in Australia’s&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/28/australia/australia-endangered-koalas-queensland-intl-hnk-dst"&gt; koala population&lt;/a&gt; has been approved for rollout, in a world-first project.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3y0002356nbnbizxab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers from the University of the Sunshine Coast spent more than 10 years developing a single-dose vaccine to protect the famed Australian marsupial from the effects of chlamydia, which include urinary tract infections, infertility, blindness and death, the university said in a statement Wednesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0003356nxq66mb4d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chlamydia is responsible for half of koala deaths in the country’s wild populations, which are predominantly found in the eucalyptus forests along Australia’s eastern coast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0004356nfsb1iofh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day, particularly in South East Queensland and New South Wales, where infection rates within populations are often around 50 percent and in some cases can reach as high as 70 percent,” Peter Timms, professor of microbiology at UniSC’s Centre for Bioinnovation, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/koala-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0005356nzt6d4790@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often used as an emblem of Australian culture, the fluffy gray marsupials can only be found in Australia, and are considered endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Aside from disease, the creatures are vulnerable to habitat loss, animal attacks and being hit by cars, and were named critically endangered in 2022, &lt;a href="https://wwf.org.au/what-we-do/species/koala/" target="_blank"&gt;according to &lt;/a&gt;Australia’s World Wildlife Fund (WWF).
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdrzkva0000356n7d6wfkq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They are also often victims of the deadly bushfires that have ravaged Australia in its summer months in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/australia/koalas-reduce-one-third-intl-hnk"&gt;recent years.&lt;/a&gt; This year, some 860 koalas in Budj Bim National Park were shot from the air to “reduce suffering” after a bushfire, CNN affiliate &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/koalas-shooting-victoria-national-park-petition/75fc6dee-9de9-4944-84c7-991c68bb9faa" target="_blank"&gt;9News reported.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0006356noo2b6qpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Antibiotics were previously used to treat chlamydia in koalas, but the drugs often interfere with their ability to digest their staple diet of eucalyptus leaves, causing them to starve to death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0007356nnsyngqge@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now approved by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for production and widespread use, in a what researchers describe as a “world first,” the chlamydia vaccine has already been trialed on hundreds of wild and captive koalas, according to UniSC, which noted it had already been tested across multiple generations of the animal in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-024-00938-5" target="_blank"&gt;a study published last year.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0008356n01rr3x41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study found that the vaccine reduced the likelihood of koalas developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65 percent,” said researcher Sam Phillips, who led the study, which was the largest and longest study of wild koalas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z0009356nmisgbd2h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s based on Chlamydia pecorum’s major outer membrane protein (MOMP), and offers three levels of protection — reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and, in some cases, reversing existing symptoms,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z000a356nfgz5jc4a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In humans, chlamydia is a bacterial &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/13/health/college-hookup-culture-wellness"&gt;sexually transmitted infection&lt;/a&gt; that can cause infertility if left untreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfdpzc3z000b356nbmqv64y1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The disease spreads in koala populations through reproduction and social behavior connected to mating. In addition, baby koalas — known as joeys — can catch the disease from their mothers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

"I think that's a pretty interesting finding given where we spent the last five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ahmad said fewer deaths from COVID in 2024 compared to 2023 may be a reason behind the 3.8% decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Ever since it came onto the scene in 2020, COVID was one of the top 10 leading causes of death," Ahmad said. "It started off as a third-leading cause and, in 2024, we see that it's not ranked at all, actually. So, it's still among the 15 leading causes, but not in the top 10."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Sharonne Hayes, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, agreed that fewer cases of COVID-19 are likely driving the reduction in mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think there's a little less COVID, right? I mean, that's part of it," she told ABC News. "I think that the pandemic was such a time of both COVID-related deaths, but also just rising risk factors, particularly around cardiovascular disease, people's lifestyles were less healthy. And maybe we are coming back to more of where we are before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Ahmad said another driver for the drop in deaths could be the decline in drug overdose deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A CDC report published in May found that &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2025/20250514.htm" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. drug overdose deaths fell by nearly 27% in 2024&lt;/a&gt; to the lowest levels seen in five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Katie Schmitz, a visiting professor of medicine in the department of medicine and cancer epidemiologist at the University of Pittsburgh, told ABC News that leading causes of death continue to be cardiac disease and cancer-related deaths due to an aging population, as well as underlying factors such as obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Schmitz noted that we have an increase in proportion of the population with these co-morbidities and it's important to highlight that access to health care can be limited, particularly for rural populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Other leading causes of death in the report included stroke, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also found that death rates decreased from 2023 to 2024 among all racial/ethnic groups.

Death rates in 2024 were lowest for children between ages 5 and 14 at 14.4 per 100,000 and highest for people age 85 and older at 13,835.5 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Schmitz said investments should be made that focus on prevention -- such as addressing rising obesity rates -- and early screenings, which can vary with socioeconomic status and geography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hayes said making lifestyle changes is hard, but it is one of the best ways to lower the risk of some of the leading causes of death, including heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Whether it's eating more vegetables, [decreasing] saturated fat, maintaining a healthy weight is going to help stroke, cancer, and heart disease risk as well as liver disease, kidney disease, and diabetes," she said.

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time obesity has overtaken &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/global-food-security/t-19020431"&gt;undernourishment&lt;/a&gt; as the leading form of malnutrition among children aged five to 19, according to the report released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, "when we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children," UNICEF chief Catherine Russell said in a statement on the &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/obesity-exceeds-underweight-first-time-among-school-age-children-and-adolescents" title="External link — report's release."&gt;report's release.&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What did the report say about undernourishment and obesity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, the number of underweight children has dropped from nearly 13% to 9.2%, among 5- to 19-year olds, according to data collected in over 190 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, obesity rates have nearly tripled from 3% to 9.4% during the same period. The report suggests one in five children aged five to 19 years are overweight, totalling some 391 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "tipping point" was predicted by UNICEF back in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obesity now exceeds underweight in all regions globally except sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Many high-income countries continue to have high levels of obesity, including 27% of 5- to 19-year-olds in Chile, 21% in the US and 21% in the UAE, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Don't let obesity take you down" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Don't let obesity take you down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-67517715" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="67517715" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/67517935_605.webp" data-duration="05:33"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/vdt/2023/beng231122_77peeng231122_healthy_me_obesity_3_01smw_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/vdt/2023/beng231122_77peeng231122_healthy_me_obesity_3_01smw_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is causing the rise in obesity?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers at UNICEF, the rising trend of obesity is largely due to unhealthy food environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report warned that "ultra-processed and fast foods – high in sugar, refined starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives – are shaping children's diets through unhealthy food environments, rather than personal choice."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Obesity is a growing concern that can impact the health and development of children," Russell said in the statement. "Ultra-processed food is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children's growth, cognitive development and mental health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To curb the rising trend of obesity, the report included suggestions such as improving the food environment by including food labelling, implementing food marketing restrictions and banning the provision or sale of ultra-processed and junk foods in schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also suggested firming up social protection programs to address income poverty and improve financial access to nutritious diets.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study shows that ultra-processed foods (UPFs) can harm men's health in a trio of notable ways: through weight gain, through the disruption of natural hormones, and through a reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-concerning-link-between-semen-quality-and-obesity"&gt;sperm quality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study, led by a team from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, wanted to see if the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-vs-minimally-processed-food-simple-tips-to-make-better-choices"&gt;processed nature&lt;/a&gt; of food makes a difference to a person's health – even if calories and nutrients in a diet are kept the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of research has linked UPFs with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-finds-no-safe-level-of-processed-meat-consumption"&gt;poor health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, but it's not always clear if this is because of how the food has been made, because of the ingredients that go into them, or because we tend to eat them in greater amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-food-packaging-is-shedding-microplastics-into-every-meal-study-reveals"&gt;Your Food Packaging Is Shedding Microplastics Into Every Meal, Study Reveals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were shocked by how many body functions were disrupted by ultra-processed foods, even in healthy young men," &lt;a href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/not-all-calories-are-equal-ultra-processed-foods-harm-mens-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Romain Barrès, from the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The long-term implications are alarming and highlight the need to revise nutritional guidelines to better protect against chronic disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173363" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/FoodGraphic.jpg" alt="Food graphic" class="wp-image-173363 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/FoodGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/FoodGraphic-489x415.jpg 489w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/FoodGraphic-600x509.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173363" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers compared unprocessed vs ultra-processed diets. (Preston et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Metab.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers signed up 43 cisgender men aged between 20 and 35, who tried two different diets, with a three-month break in between. The two diets were matched by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-many-calories-do-you-need-to-cut-each-day-to-lose-weight"&gt;calories and nutrient&lt;/a&gt; intake, but one went heavy (77 percent of calories) on UPFs and the other was mostly (66 percent of calories) unprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While on the UPF diet, the men gained around a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of extra fat mass on average, while levels of a plastics-related pthalate chemical called cxMINP also rose a worrying amount: it's a substance that's known to interfere &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/er.2009-0002"&gt;with natural hormones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third negative effect of the UPF diet spotted by the researchers was a drop in testosterone levels and in the follicle-stimulating hormone that's crucial for sperm production. It's notable that sperm quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;has decreased worldwide&lt;/a&gt; as UPFs have become more widely eaten, and scientists have long suspected there might be a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that UPF consumption influences cardiometabolic and reproductive health," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.08.004"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. "Diets also caused a trend in the differential accumulation of contaminants in blood and seminal fluid"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPFs are characterized both by the synthetic ingredients included in them (which you wouldn't find on a grocery store shelf), and by the ways they are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-processed_food"&gt;treated and manufactured&lt;/a&gt; on an industrial-scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their introduction into our diets has meant lower costs and longer shelf life for foods, as well as enhanced taste and flavors, but the evidence is rapidly mounting that they're pushing us &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-5-days-of-junk-food-can-trigger-obesitys-hold-on-your-brain"&gt;towards obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-ultra-processed-foods-may-fuel-bowel-cancer"&gt;various cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-food-may-exacerbate-cognitive-decline-new-studies-show"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; – and they're &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-are-trashing-the-planet-scientists-warn"&gt;not great for the planet&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study uses a relatively small sample size over a short time period – and only involves men – it's more evidence that we need to rethink how many UPFs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-processed-foods-could-sabotage-weight-loss-even-on-a-healthy-diet"&gt;we're taking on board&lt;/a&gt;, and how healthier alternatives could be eaten instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results prove that ultra-processed foods harm our reproductive and metabolic health, even if they're not eaten in excess," &lt;a href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/not-all-calories-are-equal-ultra-processed-foods-harm-mens-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutrition scientist Jessica Preston, from the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This indicates that it is the processed nature of these foods that makes them harmful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.08.004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Even in poorer countries that is now a real concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Children are considered overweight when they are significantly heavier than a healthy weight for their age, sex and height. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Obesity is a severe form of being overweight, and is linked to a higher risk of type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers, in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Throughout childhood, good nutrition, including plenty of fruit, vegetables and protein, plays a vital role in growth, cognitive development and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But many traditional diets are being displaced by ultra-processed foods, often high in sugar, starch, salt, unhealthy fats and additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Unicef executive director Catherine Russell says the challenges posed by obesity should not be under-estimated.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that supports immune function, and heart, bone, muscle and nerve health. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D can be made in your body from sunlight, but it is also found in salmon, egg yolks and supplements. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too much vitamin D can cause severe symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and kidney stones. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people supplement with vitamin D, especially during the colder months when it’s more difficult to get your daily dose from sunlight (since &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-sunscreen-block-vitamin-d-8638665" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your skin makes vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; with sufficient sunlight exposure). But can you take too much vitamin D? How do you know when it’s too much? And could you actually die from taking too much?

You may have noticed that some milks tend to be fortified with vitamin D. This is because vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium, which is necessary to build strong bones. Vitamin D also supports muscle and nerve function, heart health and immunity.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your skin makes vitamin D when exposed to sunlight—but enough of your skin needs to be exposed and it needs to be for a long enough period. Even if you have enough skin exposure, certain things can shield your skin from absorbing enough sunlight, including pollution, sunscreen and melanin content (darker skin tends to not absorb sunlight as well as lighter skin, as darker skin provides protection from UV rays). Even what latitude you’re at and what season it is will influence your UV absorption and vitamin D production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This amount depends on your age. Recommendations start at 25 mcg (1,000 IU) for newborns and go up to 100 mcg (4,000 IU) for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s important to note that these are recommended daily vitamin D intakes and include vitamin D from all sources—like food and beverages—not just supplements. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sun exposure for adequate vitamin D production might be less than you think. Research suggests you can get enough vitamin D by exposing your arms and legs to sunlight (without clothing or sunscreen) at midday (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.) for 5 to 30 minutes at least twice a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

It naturally occurs in egg yolks, mushrooms that have been exposed to UV light, and fatty fish like salmon, tuna and sardines. Some foods are also fortified with vitamin D, including milk, cereal and juice.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The short answer is yes, you can die from too much vitamin D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many cases of vitamin D toxicity start as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7950001/signs-you-might-have-a-vitamin-d-deficiency/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. In analyzing the data, researchers found that people who were deficient in vitamin D—or presumed to be deficient based on living in colder regions—took vitamin D supplements in doses that were higher than what is recommended. Or the dose they supplemented with, combined with foods containing vitamin D, put them over the limit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Typically, this type of toxicity happens over time, as opposed to overdosing all at once with the vitamin. “Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D acts like a hormone, so an excess of it in your body can lead to other health problems, such as hypercalcemia (high levels of calcium in your blood),” explains &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/maria-laura-haddad-garcia/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia&lt;/a&gt;, editorial manager, nutrition and news, at &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt;. “This buildup of vitamin D in your body may happen when you take very high doses of vitamin D for several months. Additionally, since vitamin D is fat-soluble, your body can't get rid of it like it does with water-soluble vitamins.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note that vitamin D toxicity does not occur with sun exposure, as the body limits how much vitamin D it makes from UV light. With that said, too much sun exposure carries other risks, including sunburn and skin cancer, so it’s still important to take proper precautions to avoid these risks. Keep in mind, though, that for the body to produce enough vitamin D, you do need some sun exposure without sunscreen. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before vitamin D toxicity occurs, there are warning signs, these include:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dehydration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excessive urination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thirst&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney stones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If it’s not caught in time, vitamin D toxicity can progress to kidney failure, irregular heartbeat and eventually, death. If you’re taking vitamin D and are experiencing any of the warning signs, it’s important to stop supplementing and see a health care professional. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is a necessary nutrient for many functions in our bodies and for overall good health. And like anything else, too much of a good thing is too much. If you’re already supplementing with vitamin D or wondering if you should be, the surest way to know if you’re on target is to request bloodwork from a health care professional to see the status of your vitamin D level. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, the best way to get vitamin D is through &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-sunscreen-block-vitamin-d-8638665" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sufficient safe sun exposure&lt;/a&gt; and foods that contain vitamin D. Egg yolks, mushrooms, fatty fish and fortified milk provide vitamin D plus a host of other nutrients that are necessary for good health. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7952410/spinach-mushroom-egg-casserole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Spinach, Mushroom &amp;amp; Egg Casserole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7894353/salmon-with-sun-dried-tomato-cream-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Salmon with Sun-Dried Tomato Cream Sauce&lt;/a&gt; are a good place to start.

&lt;p&gt;The answer to this differs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/amit-jain" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7938304" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Amit Jain&lt;/a&gt;, minimally-invasive spine surgery chief in the department of orthopaedic surgery at Johns Hopkins Medicine, noted that “good posture results in reduced wear and tear of the spine.” &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2017/08/getting-it-straight#:~:text=The%20foundation%20of%20good%20posture,are%20either%20overweight%20or%20obese." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7938304" data-affiliate="true"&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, slouching can cause your spine to become more fragile and make it more prone to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While good posture doesn’t necessarily mean you won’t develop back issues one day, having good spinal strength could help you better manage if you do have to deal with these conditions in the future, Mallozzi added. Your muscles will have to work harder if your posture results in an uneven distribution of weight or an unfair strain on your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, people who droop their necks to look at their phones or other handheld devices often suffer from “text neck,” which creates additional strain on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciara Cappo, a chiropractor in California, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/text-neck-treatment#TOC_TITLE_HDR_1" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7938304" data-affiliate="true"&gt;told Healthline&lt;/a&gt; that “the human head weighs 10 pounds. For every inch your head is tilted forward, the weight your neck has to carry doubles.” So, that hunched over texting posture is certainly not doing your neck muscles any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But standing up straight may not fix any health problems, either. It also won’t necessarily save you from any existing back issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is very little, if any, evidence to support posture and either reduction in current pain or prevention of future pain,” Queralt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Queralt &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33444448/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7938304" data-affiliate="true"&gt;pointed to a study&lt;/a&gt; that notes that “the practice of generic public health messages to sit up straight to prevent neck pain needs rethinking,” and found that slumped posture in teenagers resulted in less neck pain in young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, should I not care about ‘good posture’?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

After all, you’re more likely to be attracted to and want to be around somebody you can relate to. But research now shows that these are far from the only characteristics spouses share. A new study concluded that spouses may actually pass mental health issues back and forth to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health issues are, of course, not contagious in the traditional sense. But research suggested that spouses can sort of infect each other with them. A team of 19 researchers from across the globe discovered this “spousal correlation” across nine different mental health conditions. If one spouse developed the condition, the other was more likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Developing a mental health condition after your spouse is diagnosed is no coincidence.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international researchers published their findings in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02298-z" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/a&gt;. David Nield reported on the study for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/couples-are-more-likely-to-share-psychiatric-disorders-but-why" rel="nofollow"&gt;Science Alert&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that this kind of “spousal correlation” is not unusual among things like religious and political beliefs. Researchers now believe that this correlation extends to things we don’t really have control over, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-09/spouses-can-infect-each-other-mental-health-issues-according-research-husband-wife.png" alt="happy husband and wife" title="Spouses Can Infect Each Other With Mental Health Issues, According To Research" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;RDNE Stock project | Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers studied five million pairs of Taiwanese spouses and examined their mental health characteristics. They were then compared to pairs from the Danish and Swedish national registries. The researchers discovered that the couples had a lot in common, including their mental health. “We found that a majority of psychiatric disorders have consistent spousal correlations across nations and over generations, indicating their importance in the population dynamics of psychiatric disorders,” they explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nield identified the mental health issues that researchers found were subject to spousal correlation as ADHD, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, autism, bipolar disorder, depression, OCD, schizophrenia, and substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/type-people-hate-depends-how-smart-you-are"&gt;The Type Of People You Hate Depends On How Smart You Are, Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apparently, there are three reasons for the spousal correlation of mental health issues.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fascinating to know that there is this connection between spouses for these nine conditions in particular, but it does cause one to wonder why such a correlation exists. Nield said it happens because we tend to pick partners who are similar to ourselves. The whole “opposites attract” thing may not be as likely as some people think. There are also certain factors that create limitations when picking a partner, like socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third reason is perhaps the easiest to predict. It’s the fact that you’re bound to become more similar to someone if you live in the same environment with them. Researchers were unable to determine which of the three reasons was the most important or influential factor, as they all played a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, these conclusions could turn what we know about human coupling on its head. It has long been believed to be random, but this causes one to wonder if that is really true. Additionally, studies like this one could help scientists determine why these conditions take root and what treatment would be best for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/study-finds-70-percent-workers-engaging-private-activity-job"&gt;Study Finds 70% Of Workers Are Engaging In This Private Activity On The Job, Even When Most Would Rather Not&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Previous research has examined whether or not mental health issues can be 'inherited' by posterity, but never really touched on spousal correlation.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group of researchers did find that children who had parents who each had a certain mental health condition were more likely to have it themselves.

The risk is even higher for identical twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the idea that spouses can somehow pass mental health issues to each other is a new one, and it really has no basis in other research.

&lt;p&gt;Despite new federal limits on who can get a Covid-19 vaccine and the arrival of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html"&gt;cold and flu season&lt;/a&gt;, many Vermonters can still get a booster, though details surrounding Medicare reimbursement and federal recommendations remain uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1960742897201872969"&gt;late August post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the Food and Drug Administration approved Covid-19 booster shots, but only for those 65 and above or with existing health risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vermont state officials are now awaiting a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which typically guides public health directives and insurers’ coverage, for those who want to get a fall booster shot.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Really the best thing that I can recommend is either to go online and see if you can set up an online appointment (for a vaccine), or call pharmacies in your area to see if they’re available,” said Julie Arel, the state’s interim commissioner of health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Vermont, pharmacies are moving forward with administering the vaccine. Kinney Drugs and CVS have the updated Covid vaccines in stock. Pharmacies order directly from the manufacturer. Providers — doctors’ offices and other clinics — often get vaccines through the state, which is not yet able to order the vaccines from the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Kinney Drugs’ spokesperson Alice Maggiore confirmed that the stores can administer the 2025-26 vaccines to people above 65 and individuals between 12 and 64 who attest to having one of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html"&gt;qualifying conditions, as outlined by the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVS is able to vaccinate anyone over 5 years old, who attests to eligibility under the same CDC’s preexisting conditions list, or anyone older than 65, according to a company executive, Amy Thibault. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlying risks outlined by the CDC range from asthma or a smoking history to mental health disorders, like depression obesity, or physical inactivity. Patients do not need a doctor’s prescription to confirm the underlying condition at Kinney or CVS, both spokespeople said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, insurers cover vaccines received in a pharmacy. Whether some private and government insurers will be able to cover the vaccines remains uncertain. Even if people can get the vaccine by walking into a pharmacy, it’s unclear if they will have to pay for it:  “It’s a little bit mind boggling,” Arel said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the state’s largest private insurer, plans to continue to cover the vaccine for any member, at no cost and with no prior approval, said Andrew Garland, a vice president and spokesperson for the insurer. Blue Cross Blue Shield of VT intends to do so through 2026, as well. MVP, the state’s other private insurer selling plans on the marketplace, also does not anticipate changes in its vaccine coverage policy, said Elizabeth Boody, a spokesperson for the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What employer-sponsored insurers and providers like Tricare, the military health system, might be able to cover, is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the FDA has already approved the vaccine for those over 65, it is likely that Medicare, which covers the same age group, will cover the vaccines. Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California Law, San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-medicare-isnt-covering-updated-covid-shots-yet-rcna229338?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20Daily%20Health%20Policy%20Report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9g4vn2FcKwK2WsToNz0QzZ0ZssBbpVDhNryCG8pTeBhrZFYwE0Syr0RfgZFirPeoe-lIhlOhk_WEcGHSn14AMaN8D8ow&amp;amp;_hsmi=379503873&amp;amp;utm_content=379503873&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;told NBC News&lt;/a&gt; that once the FDA approves a vaccine, Medicare has the authority to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally a Covid vaccine undergoes three steps for approval: First the FDA authorizes the new vaccines — &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontechs-comirnatyr-receives-us-fda-approval"&gt;which it did in August&lt;/a&gt;. Then a panel within the CDC called ACIP (short for Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) issues a recommendation on the vaccine. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html"&gt;scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19&lt;/a&gt;, to do so. This year many are holding their breath ahead of ACIP’s announcement, since Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/26/kennedys-vaccine-panel-met-for-the-first-time-heres-what-to-know-00428461"&gt;gutted the panel and replaced it with many vaccine skeptics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The state is weighing whether and how it will need to break from that typical process, and is currently exploring what Vermont statute allows for breaking with that process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is quite common for providers to prescribe a drug &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/understanding-unapproved-use-approved-drugs-label"&gt;outside of what the FDA has authorized them for&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not typical, however, for that to happen with vaccines. The FDA’s lack of formal guidance on what qualifies as an underlying condition leaves room for interpretation surrounding who qualifies for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s some flexibility in there, but because it’s not as clear as usual, there is going to be hesitancy, in all likelihood,” said Arel. “And anytime there’s hesitancy, anytime there’s confusion, it’s going to lead to lower immunization rates. We really want to try to avoid that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health is also looking to Vermont’s neighbors in the Northeast for direction, Arel said. In August, the &lt;a href="https://vtdigger.org/2025/08/28/with-cdc-in-chaos-vermont-joins-regional-coalition-to-navigate-public-health-challenges/"&gt;department joined with other state health departments&lt;/a&gt; in the region to build a coalition ready to respond to shifts in federal guidance. Though the group has no unified recommendation, she says it’s something they are considering to help mediate the current disjunctive state of vaccine recommendations and approvals. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“If as a region, we can become more aligned, it helps people across the whole Northeast region to feel a level of confidence in their state public health department’s decisions and how we’re moving forward,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Massachusetts, Gov. Maura Healy &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-healey-announces-immediate-steps-to-ensure-vaccine-availability-in-massachusetts-amid-trump-rfk-rollbacks"&gt;required in-state insurance carriers to cover the vaccines&lt;/a&gt; recommended by the state’s Department of Public Health, even if they are outside of the federal recommendations. The state’s commissioner of public health also &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/standing-order-for-dispensing-and-administration-of-covid-19-vaccine-2025-2026"&gt;issued a standing order&lt;/a&gt; that allows pharmacists to issue Covid shots to anyone over the age of 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, Arel said Vermont is watching its neighbors and looking into where state statute might allow for potential action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Getting clarity and having a message be clear and simple, is going to be the most important thing we do,” Arel said. “Unfortunately, we are still working through all of that, but we are committed to finding our way through it and making it as simple and easy as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

Rates were also high in richer countries, such as Chile (27%), the US (21%) and the United Arab Emirates (21%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the UK, the percentage of overweight children increased from 29% in 2000 to 30% in 2022, while the percentage with obesity rose from 9% to 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The steepest rise in numbers of overweight schoolchildren and teenagers was in low- and middle-income countries, where the number has more than doubled since 2000, amid a corresponding rapid expansion of “modern retail outlets, online grocery stores and food delivery apps”, with UPFs being “relatively cheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious foods”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Childhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is growing international concern about the damaging &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/28/ultra-processed-food-32-harmful-effects-health-review" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health impacts of UPFs&lt;/a&gt;, which include cereals, biscuits and cakes, fizzy drinks and ready meals, which have been through industrial processes and include additives such as colours, emulsifiers and flavours, and can be high in added sugar, fat or salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;UPFs “dominate shops and schools”, the report warned, and are heavily promoted to young people and parents digitally, creating an environment where they are hard to avoid, rather than a matter of personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bbc35bb6-92a3-4a84-bd0e-184814a9f091" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Sweets on sale at a roadside stall in Nairobi.

That double burden is shaping a generation’s health,” she said, adding that children were targeted by “relentless” marketing of fast food, &lt;a href="https://heala.org/why-are-south-african-classrooms-and-children-becoming-fast-food-billboards/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;even in schools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s really tough trying to tackle both undernutrition and obesity at the same time.

&lt;p&gt;Vermont’s Department of Health confirmed the state’s first-known human case of the mosquito-borne Jamestown Canyon virus. The disease has relatively mild symptoms, especially for young people who do not have underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state began &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/mosquitoes-vermont"&gt;monitoring mosquitoes for Jamestown Canyon Virus&lt;/a&gt; this year, after it was found in nearby states. The monitoring showed insects in Rutland, Marshfield and Whitingham all carried the disease. This human case, which was confirmed in a Sept. 8 lab test in a Windsor County patient, further confirms the presence of the virus in Vermont, according to Natalie Kwit, the state’s public health veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a good indicator and reminder, just like anytime we find the virus in mosquitoes, to continue to take precautions against mosquito bites,” Kwit said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes become infected when they bite animals — particularly deer — carrying the virus. They then spread it to other animals and people when they bite them. Humans are “dead end hosts,” meaning that the viral load people receive from an infected mosquito bite is too low to spread to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means that many people with the virus never experience symptoms, while others can develop&lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/jamestown-canyon-virus"&gt; flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as fevers, headaches, chills and aches. People with compromised immune systems and older people are more at risk for more severe symptoms — for some, more serious disease could escalate to confusion and discoordination, stiffness and seizure. About half of people who do become symptomatic get hospitalized, according to the Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The best way to prevent infection is to prevent mosquito bites in the first place. The Department of Health recommends limiting time outside during dusk and dawn when the insects are most active, wearing long sleeves and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you"&gt;insect repellent&lt;/a&gt;, and covering windows, doors, playpens and strollers with tight mosquito nets or screens. The department also advises people to clear any standing water that may accumulate in things like pots, buckets or children’s outdoor toys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late summer, the risk for mosquito-borne illnesses increases, Kwit said, since there has been more time for the virus to circulate in hosts and mosquitoes. The risk remains — and the state plans to continue monitoring mosquitoes — until the first fall frost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state also tests the collected mosquito samples for &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/west-nile-virus"&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/mosquito-borne-diseases/eastern-equine-encephalitis"&gt;Eastern equine encephalitis — or EEE — virus&lt;/a&gt;, as it has in years past. There have been no confirmed cases of either in a human this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re just learning about this virus, too,” Kwit said of Jamestown Canyon virus. “We’ve only just started actively testing for it in mosquitoes we collect in Vermont, so over time, we’ll get an understanding of where we’re finding it, as we’re gathering more evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;

At this year's Oscars, actress Rachel Sennott said, 'Take that beta-blocker, girl. Swallow it down and lock in.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors and pharmacists told the Daily Mail that they are seeing more women asking for propranolol prescriptions than ever before in hopes of getting fast-acting anxiety relief without lasting side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jennifer Lee, a 37-year-old healthcare worker from Texas, told the Daily Mail propranolol has helped slow the physical symptoms of her panic disorder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said the drug helps slow the 'physical manifestations of anxiety' like a racing heart and mounting blood pressure, calming the body's fight-or-flight response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haiyan Wang, medical director and psychiatrist at Neuro Wellness Spa, told the Daily Mail: 'I see this constantly now. Young women are drawn to it because it works differently. Instead of targeting brain chemistry, it interrupts the physical feedback loop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When your heart isn't pounding, your brain doesn't read the situation as dangerous.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they cautioned that it is not going to replace selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and sedatives that rewire brain chemistry and hormone levels. It may work for a big speech, but it likely will not treat anxiety on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Parth Bhavasar, a family medicine physician and founder of TeleDirectMD, told the Daily Mail that while it makes the body feel calm, it doesn't address the underlying root cause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It doesn't treat the anxiety per se, but it just blunts the physical manifestations of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;B&lt;span&gt;eta blockers, which blocks the effects of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there are several types of beta blockers prescribed in the US, propranolol is one of the few that is fat soluble. That means it is stored in the body's fatty tissues - where it also dissolves - rather than liquid sources like the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood-brain barrier is covered by protective cells with fat-rich membranes, so fat  soluble medications like propranolol can more easily pass through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gaby Cora, a psychiatrist and CEO at CoraLG, Inc, in Miami, told the Daily Mail she has prescribed propranolol for musicians to alleviate anxious tremors before they step on stage and academics before tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've been prescribing beta blockers for anxiety for decades,' she said. 'They work!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Propranolol, pictured here, is prescribed to about 10 million Americans a year, mainly for high blood pressure and other heart issues (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert Downey Jr made headlines during his 2024 Golden Globes acceptance speech (pictured here) for revealing he took a beta-blocker beforehand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Taylor Love Peterson of Nashville said in a recent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-a8046530-8db6-11f0-92a7-71f500ea6e44"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; video that she started taking the drug 'on an as-needed basis... And oh my gosh, this has helped me so much.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Love Peterson said she has had no side effects from taking the drug once or twice a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas-based healthcare worker Jennifer Lee, 37, received a recommendation for the medication from her psychiatrist. It was meant to treat her panic disorder, poor impulse control and social anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lee also takes diazepam, a benzodiazepine that increases the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA, which inhibits and reduces nerve activity in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, since benzodiazepines can be highly addictive, she wanted to limit her diazepam usage by balancing it with something milder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lee said she could feel propranolol's effects shortly after starting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph from a 2025 study in Frontiers in Medicine shows the top reasons medical and dental students gave for taking propranolol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I definitely could feel my overall atmosphere start to get stable,' she said. 'My vitals stabilized, my heartbeat slowed down in a good way. [I was] feeling relaxed without feeling high.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lee said she doesn't worry about physical dependence, abuse or addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Propranolol use has become particularly widespread among younger women, who see its effects more noticeably than men do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bhavasar said this might be because women tend to have smaller hearts than men, so they generally need to work harder to pump the same amount of blood, increasing heart rate. Estrogen also increases the heart's sensitivity to adrenaline and quickens pulse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taylor Love Peterson, pictured here, said in a recent TikTok video that she takes propranolol before big events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lee, pictured here, told the Daily Mail that for her, propranolol 'is a very healthy alternative to a benzo'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended dose ranges from 10 to 40 milligrams, which should be taken 30 minutes to an hour before a planned stressor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The benefits are clear: relief without sedation or addiction potential.

Kennedy Jr., presented his “smoking gun” at a Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing on vaccine science. Siri, who has represented Kennedy in multiple lawsuits against federal health agencies and reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;helped interview candidates for Department of Health and Human Services positions&lt;/a&gt;, unveiled a study riddled with the exact flaws that peer review is designed to catch: fundamental study design errors, statistical impossibilities inconsistent with known prevalence, and results that collapse under routine epidemiologic scrutiny. Notably, even this study’s own data showed no association between vaccines and autism, the condition most frequently cited by vaccine critics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, known as the Henry Ford Health system analysis, was completed years ago and remains unpublished. It purports to show that vaccinated children have dramatically higher rates of chronic conditions than unvaccinated children. That it remains unpublished isn’t suppression, as Siri alleged, but rather quality control. The bitter irony of this hearing’s title — “How the Corruption of Science Has Impacted Public Perception” — is that, as I testified to the subcommittee, the real corruption on display isn’t in journals rejecting flawed studies. It’s in bypassing peer review entirely, shopping for any analysis that supports predetermined conclusions, then presenting it as evidence on a Senate stage. The analysis contains fundamental mistakes that any credible journal would flag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most glaring problem is detection bias, which occurs when one group gets examined more frequently than another, leading to more diagnoses regardless of actual disease rates. In the Henry Ford data, vaccinated children had substantially more health care visits than unvaccinated children. Conditions requiring clinical evaluation to diagnose — ADHD, learning disorders, speech delays, ear infections — will inevitably be recorded more often in the frequently seen group. Yet the authors never correct for this gap. Their only check was to drop children who never had a single encounter with a health care provider, which still leaves one group averaging seven visits a year and the other averaging two. That doesn’t level the playing field; it simply bakes the bias into the results. What they’re measuring is exposure to medical observation, not the effects of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take the claim of a six- to eight-fold increase in ear infections among vaccinated children. This is medically implausible but perfectly explained by detection bias. A child who rarely sees a clinician won’t have “otitis media” coded in their record, even if they’ve had ear pain. While untreated ear infections can resolve on their own, they subject children to unnecessary pain, potential hearing damage, and risk of complications like mastoiditis or meningitis. The study repeatedly conflates absence of diagnosis with absence of disease.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The statistical red flags accumulate. The authors report near-zero cases of common conditions like ADHD and learning disabilities among thousands of unvaccinated children. Data show these conditions affect roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4473855/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;11%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10334291/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;9%&lt;/a&gt; of children, respectively. Finding essentially none suggests these conditions went undiagnosed and unrecorded in children who rarely saw doctors. In several categories, hazard ratios can’t even be calculated because all cases occur in the vaccinated group — exactly what happens when diagnoses are missed in the comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Real vaccine adverse events do exist, and surveillance systems successfully detect them: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26452420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anaphylaxis at roughly 1.3 per million doses&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/66675/WHO_V-B_00.36_eng.pdf;jsessionid=8B06B71D54A3119648F061BA34612A07?sequence=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;febrile seizures after MMR vaccine at approximately 333 per million doses&lt;/a&gt;. A system that can detect signals at these magnitudes while filtering out spurious ones is working as intended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Properly conducted vaccinated-versus-unvaccinated comparisons look very different from the Henry Ford analysis. A 2014 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14006367" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;meta-analysis of more than 1.25 million children&lt;/a&gt; published in Vaccine found no link between vaccines and autism. Denmark’s &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nationwide registry studies&lt;/a&gt; found no association with Type 1 diabetes or autism. A study published in the Journal of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(13)00144-3/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed these findings&lt;/a&gt;. Germany’s nationally representative &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3057555/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;KiGGS study&lt;/a&gt; of 13,453 children, including 94 completely unvaccinated, found no meaningful differences in chronic conditions when appropriate methods were used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If one accepts the Henry Ford paper’s methodology, you’d also have to accept its finding of no link to autism. You can’t declare a study definitive when it seems to support your views and suddenly invalid where it doesn’t. That would be selective interpretation, not science.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Elevating an unpublished, methodologically flawed analysis on a Senate stage has real consequences. The irony is striking: witnesses claiming that vaccine science has been corrupted present as evidence a study with detection bias so fundamental that any epidemiology student would catch it. If the scientific establishment truly were suppressing data, they’d presumably choose something more sophisticated than failing to publish work that confuses health care visits with actual illness. This undermines evidence-based policymaking, confuses parents trying to make informed decisions, and distracts from work that actually improves vaccine safety: investing in surveillance systems, funding research to identify those at higher risk of adverse events, and communicating transparently about trade-offs. When Congress elevates unpublished analyses while dismissing peer-reviewed evidence, it sets a dangerous precedent for how science is weighed in policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents deserve better than political theater. They deserve a system that acknowledges real risks, quantifies them honestly, and updates guidance as data accumulate. They deserve policymakers who can distinguish between methodologically sound analyses and those with fatal flaws. And they deserve to know that the overwhelming body of high-quality research, using proper controls and accounting for health care utilization, finds no increased risk of chronic conditions from routine childhood vaccination, even as we continue studying safety and improving our systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When public health policy is shaped by studies that can’t distinguish health care utilization from health outcomes, we all lose. The science on vaccine safety remains imperfect and incomplete, but substituting unpublished analyses with fundamental errors for peer-reviewed evidence won’t make children safer. It will only make parents less certain about whom to trust.&lt;/p&gt;

Long COVID was persistent when study follow-up was 1 or 2 years, but overall prevalence estimates varied widely across studies, ranging from 3% to 80% in studies published last year.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among studies from North America, the estimated pooled prevalence was 30% (95% CI, 24% to 38%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors associated with long COVID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In analyzing risk factors, the three strongest for long COVID were being unvaccinated (odds ratio [OR], 2.09; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.81, meta-analyzed from 7 studies), infections from pre-Omicron variants (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.17, from 6 studies), and female sex (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.84, from 33 studies).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies that included only hospitalized patients found higher rates of long COVID than those who had patients with mild cases of the virus.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two most commonly identified long-COVID symptoms were memory problems and muscle weakness, both with estimated prevalence of 11%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We caution that our pooled prevalence estimates represent the percentage of individuals who ever experienced long COVID symptoms during study follow-up, rather than those who are currently experiencing symptoms at a specific point in time, among those with a history of COVID infection," the authors said.

It’s a shared experience among most people: “When we’re kids, we’re constantly stressing our motor systems: running, climbing, falling, and trying new movements beyond our comfort zones,” explains longevity expert Bill Hanks, founder and CEO of Huemn. “This is how we develop balance and coordination. As adults, we stop doing all those things, and as a result, our motor skills naturally decline.” But although this is the case for most people, it doesn’t mean it has to be the case for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;. As we get older, we can slow down this bodily and &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.realsimple.com/age-brain-declines-study-11706222" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive deterioration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;cognitive deterioration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those who continue to challenge their bodies in consistent ways will maintain sharper balance and motion as they age,” Hanks says. And to truly put it to the test, we asked longevity experts for four simple challenges you can try (at home, of course) to see how well your body’s really aging and keep the momentum going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Happens to Our Bodies as We Age?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the realities of aging is that our motor functions—strength, coordination, balance, and agility—tend to decline over time,” explains longevity expert Dr. Matt Kaeberlein, CEO of Optispan. “This isn’t just about muscles getting weaker. The nerves that carry signals to those muscles become less efficient, joints lose flexibility, and our sensory systems (such as vision, the inner ear, and even the body’s sense of position in space) all show wear and tear. Together, these changes can make reaction times slower and stumbles more likely.” While genetics and lifestyle habits vary from person to person, science has shown that we have more control over our &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/preventative-health/habits-of-people-who-age-well" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:biological aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt; than we might believe, Dr. Kaeberlein says. You can start by trying one—or all—of these simple challenges at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4 Simple Challenges to Test Your Body’s Age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;01 of 04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grip Strength Test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has shown grip strength to be a strong correlate to overall vitality, independence, and even longevity,” Hanks says. Here’s how to try it at home: place a firm grip on a jar lid and test how quickly you’re able to twist it off.

Four measles cases have been confirmed among the attendees; none of them were vaccinated, the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The health department said it is working with the Utah High School Cycling League to inform families and race participants of their possible exposure to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The event was a competition for teen cyclists in the league’s region 6, whose teams come largely from southern Utah from St. George to Moab, and as far north as Utah County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The Wasatch County School District issued a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying that none of the participants of the cycling event were Wasatch County residents. “There are no known measles cases in Wasatch County and the event was not connected to WCSD,” the district said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The new cases bring the state’s confirmed total to 24, according to the health department. Only one of those was vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Even at outdoor events, measles remains highly contagious and can spread easily, Dr. Leisha Nolen, epidemiologist for the state of Utah, said in a statement issued by the health department. She urged anyone who attended&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the event to check their measles-mumps-rubella vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The MMR vaccine is 97% effective against measles when people receive two doses, according to the state’s health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Utah vaccination data among kindergarteners shows that despite the vaccine’s effectiveness, fewer and fewer students are receiving required vaccines as more parents seek exemptions for personal and religious reasons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;During the 2024-25 school year, 11.2% of all Utah kindergarteners — and 9.9% of in-person kindergarten students — were not adequately vaccinated for measles, according to state data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear one to two weeks after exposure, according to the health department. They include a moderate fever accompanying a cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. A few days later, the department said, the fever spikes to 101 degrees or higher and a rash appears along the hairline before spreading to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 20:01:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE8xaGxRWW5ST0NDNWxYY1lmS0xtblZsTnJJdUZNcmRtdlZnakJSZUgzOUNSY2I3NUhNYi1Zc0s0dTVkMGdscHlVRjhxaU00Wkk5ZzhKbGVCSjZVMHlDQ1NHSW80bTJla2xaRTZVT3g5em9UM05OdndCdndZemZ3QQ</guid></item><item><title>肮脏的习惯，仅12小时后就有6200万美国人与精神病有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15081421/Dirty-habit-followed-62million-Americans-linked-psychosis.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are warning that potent marijuana may lead to serious mental health issues, including schizophrenia and psychosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, cannabis use has nearly doubled in the past decade with 21.8 percent of individuals aged 12 years and older - 61.8 million people - reporting cannabis use in 2023, up from 12.6 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content of THC, the psychoactive ingredient that makes one 'high' after consuming marijuana, has also increased in most strains. Today, THC content is around 20 to 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a significant rise from 1995, when the average batch of marijuana seized by the DEA had a THC content of four percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in some weed pens and vapes, THC can reach percentages in the 90s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new investigation, researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-7455a9e0-8d95-11f0-9a66-b10a4ba7e97f"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-74550da0-8d95-11f0-9a66-b10a4ba7e97f"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; looked at the effects of highly concentrated marijuana products containing at least 5mg THC or more than 10 percent of the chemical per serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They reviewed data from 99 studies that included 221,097 cannabis users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two thirds (61 percent) of studies included participants aged 18 to 59, with 4 percent including adolescents. From their analysis, 70 percent of the studies showed an unfavorable link between cannabis products containing more than 10 percent of THC per serving and psychosis or schizophrenia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts are warning how cannabis products containing high levels of THC have a high risk of triggering psychosis, following a new in-depth investigation (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cannabis is becoming easier to access and more potent. The graph refers to smokable cannabis. Other forms, such as vapes, contain up to 98 percent of THC, the psychoactive chemical in the drug linked to psychosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The association with psychosis or schizophrenia was identified quickly, even during the first 12 hours of use and was present at follow-up of up to two months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They did not mention how the frequency of cannabis use impacted the onset of mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Author of the study Dr Jonathan Samet, professor of epidemiology and environmental and occupational health at the Colorado School of Public Health, said: 'The findings are concerning and warrant a precautionary approach to using cannabis products, particularly for those with preexisting psychosis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most recent shocking cases of cannabis-induced psychosis which made headlines involved &lt;span&gt;Bryn Spejcher of Thousand Oaks, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-fd253260-92ea-11ee-8c85-ab4c6ecfd665" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, who picked up a bread knife and stabbed her new boyfriend 108 times - killing him - before turning the blade on her dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The then 32-year-old, who worked as an audiologist, then proceeded to stab herself - only stopping when police hit her nine times with a baton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2023,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12816729/Spejcher-CONVICTED-killing-boyfriend-stabbing-cannabis-psychosis.html"&gt; Spejcher was convicted of killing her boyfriend&lt;/a&gt; - Chad O'Melia, then 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, testimony from an expert witness called by the prosecution, seen exclusively by DailyMail.com, paints a vastly different picture of the perpetrator than the story would initially suggest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forensic psychiatrist and expert witness Dr Kris Mohandie told the jury that Spejcher was a 'normal' girl with 'no history of mental illness or violence' who was committed to 'doing good' in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That fateful night her brain was completely overtaken by extreme psychosis - induced by potent marijuana that had been supplied by her boyfriend, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In testimony from Spejcher herself, the healthcare professional said she'd smoked weed only a few times before, and had 'never been high'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her attack was launched because she had 'lost touch with reality', as the cannabis had triggered 'voices in her head'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following a growing number of cases echoing Spejcher's, more studies have focused on the harmful impacts of potent cannabis, especially when it comes to mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The studies assessed in the recent investigation looked at people using cannabis both for recreational purposes and therapeutically. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medicinal marijuana is commonly used to treat various conditions such as chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also look at how cannabis impacted depression and anxiety, with mixed results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;32 year-old Bryn Spejcher was said to be suffering a severe case of cannabis-induced psychosis when she brutally murdered her boyfriend in May 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In nontherapeutic studies, participants reported worsening anxiety in 53 percent of the cases and depression in 41 percent of the investigations. Healthy participants - those with no underlying conditions - were the most prone to these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In therapeutic studies, looking at how cannabis helps treat medical conditions, patients experienced relief from anxiety and depression in half of the cases. Those with cancer and neurologic conditions experienced the most benefits for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found 75 percent of the studies were associated with users developing an addiction to the drug known as cannabis use disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a mental health condition where a person compulsively uses cannabis despite experiencing significant impairment or distress in their daily life, leading to negative social, occupational, or health consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As cannabis use has increased, the population prevalence of cannabis use disorder has risen in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2023, almost one third of those who reported using cannabis, met criteria for cannabis use disorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several factors have contributed to this surge, experts say, including the decriminalization and legalization of recreational cannabis, and the increasing availability of cannabis products in legal markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, it is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-11645727/How-America-surrendered-marijuana-KAYLA-BRANTLEY-reveals-pot-ubiquitous-US.html"&gt;fully legal in 24 states&lt;/a&gt;, plus Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than half of Americans live in states where recreational marijuana is legal, and 79 percent live in a county with at least one dispensary, according to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/08/facts-about-marijuana/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent study comes of the back of another body of research that was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It revealed that patients needing hospitalization because of cannabis-related health problems were 14 times more likely to develop schizophrenia within three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Modes of marijuana use in 2023 among people aged 12 or older in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These symptoms could range from severe psychiatric symptoms such as paranoia or panic attacks to overdosing on THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that the risk for schizophrenia was 241 times higher among people needing hospitalization for cannabis-induced psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This temporary mental health condition triggered by cannabis use causes hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report found that the main cause of this major health risk was the significant rise in the levels of THC within cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa said: 'Cannabis from the 2000s is not the same as in 2025.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While schizophrenia itself is not a fatal condition, it can lead to life-threatening situations as these patients have a higher risk of dying by suicide due to severe symptoms such as depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the report revealed that about 0.47 percent of cannabis users end up experiencing symptoms of psychosis. That's roughly one in every 200 users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, up to 76 percent of those who do experience these symptoms for more than 24 hours end up needing emergency care - sending their chances of developing schizophrenia skyrocketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schizophrenia is treated with a combination of antipsychotic medications, therapy, and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antipsychotic drugs, like risperidone and olanzapine can help manage symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions by balancing brain chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help patients cope with symptoms and improve their daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:45:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>65岁以上精力充沛的人通常会发誓这7种爱好能让他们保持活力- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/z-people-over-65-who-stay-full-of-energy-usually-swear-by-these-7-hobbies-that-keep-them-moving/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="320" data-end="370"&gt;Getting older doesn’t have to mean slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="372" data-end="638"&gt;In fact, I’ve met people in their seventies and eighties who are more active and full of life than some folks in their forties. The difference? They don’t sit still for long. They’ve built movement into their everyday routines through hobbies they genuinely enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="640" data-end="744"&gt;Here are seven that come up again and again when you ask energetic people over 65 how they keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="751" data-end="781"&gt;1. Walking with intention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="783" data-end="923"&gt;You might think walking is too simple to count, but that’s the beauty of it. It’s accessible, low-impact, and can be done almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="925" data-end="1137"&gt;The people I’ve seen turn walking into a hobby don’t just stroll aimlessly. They walk with intention—whether that’s exploring a new neighborhood, hiking a trail, or joining a walking group that makes it social.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1139" data-end="1420"&gt;One man I know in his late seventies wakes up every morning, grabs his headphones, and sets out for a three-mile loop around his town. He treats it almost like meditation, syncing his steps with music or podcasts. It’s movement, yes, but also a daily ritual that keeps him sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1422" data-end="1688"&gt;As noted by the American Heart Association, regular walking &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/walking/every-step-counts?.com"&gt;improves cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, boosts mood, and even sharpens memory. And when older adults treat it as something to look forward to, not just “exercise,” it becomes the backbone of their energy routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1690" data-end="1830"&gt;Even small variations—changing routes, adding inclines, or walking with friends—turn this simple act into something surprisingly powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1837" data-end="1852"&gt;2. Dancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1854" data-end="2001"&gt;I once stumbled into a salsa class while traveling in Mexico City. Half the class was over sixty, and they were outdancing the twenty-somethings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2003" data-end="2180"&gt;That’s the thing about dancing—it works because it blends fun with movement. There’s rhythm, community, and a sense of play that makes people forget they’re exercising at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2182" data-end="2506"&gt;And it’s not just about cardio. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020748921001723?.com"&gt;Dancing challenges coordination&lt;/a&gt; and balance, keeping the brain sharp with every step and turn. Studies back this up: dance improves memory, coordination, and neuroplasticity—and is even linked to lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2508" data-end="2770"&gt;I’ve also noticed that older adults who keep dancing tend to be more socially connected. Whether it’s ballroom, line dancing, or just grooving in the living room, it’s hard not to smile when you’re moving to music. And that joy is part of why it works so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2777" data-end="2794"&gt;3. Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2796" data-end="2919"&gt;There’s something powerful about tending to plants. You bend, squat, lift, dig, and carry without even thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2921" data-end="3098"&gt;My grandmother used to say her roses kept her young. Looking back, I think she was right. Gardening gave her a daily reason to move, stretch, and stay outside in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3100" data-end="3359"&gt;What fascinates me is how holistic gardening really is. Physically, it’s like a light workout spread across hours. Psychologically, it reduces stress and provides a sense of purpose. And spiritually—if you want to go there—it’s grounding in a literal sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3361" data-end="3643"&gt;A growing body of research backs this up. A 2023 meta-analysis found that &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1142456/full?.com"&gt;horticultural therapy&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduces depressive symptoms in older adults, especially when activities are participatory and conducted in care-providing settings over 4 to 8 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3645" data-end="3765"&gt;It’s not about having a perfect lawn. Even container gardens on a balcony or indoor plants can bring similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3772" data-end="3788"&gt;4. Swimming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3790" data-end="3888"&gt;If there’s a single activity that almost every energetic older person recommends, it’s swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3890" data-end="4007"&gt;Why? Because water takes the pressure off joints while still giving you resistance. It’s exercise without the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4009" data-end="4297"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before in another post, but I learned the value of swimming when I injured my knee a few years ago. It was the only thing that kept me moving pain-free. That same principle applies to people over 65—it allows them to stay active without worrying about wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4299" data-end="4462"&gt;One retired teacher I know swears by his morning laps. “The pool is the only place I feel completely free,” he told me. “It’s like the weight of age disappears.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4464" data-end="4711"&gt;Many community centers offer senior swim hours or aqua aerobics, making it a social outlet as well. And let’s not forget: swimming works almost every muscle in the body while building cardiovascular endurance. It’s hard to beat that combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4718" data-end="4752"&gt;5. Practicing yoga or tai chi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4754" data-end="4899"&gt;“Stillness in movement, and movement in stillness.” That’s how a tai chi teacher once described it to me when I was visiting Beijing years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4901" data-end="5084"&gt;For older adults, practices like yoga and tai chi offer more than just flexibility. Tai chi, for instance, has been shown to significantly &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/tai-chi-the-winner-at-warding-off-falls?.com"&gt;reduce fall risk by up to 58%&lt;/a&gt; compared to stretching—and improve balance, stability, and muscle reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5086" data-end="5285"&gt;Yoga, meanwhile, strengthens posture, flexibility, and mobility. A review of 33 randomized controlled studies found that &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2023/03/strong-evidence-that-yoga-protects-against-frailty-in-older-adults/?.com"&gt;yoga improves walking speed&lt;/a&gt;, leg strength, and other markers of frailty—hallmarks of sustained independence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5287" data-end="5537"&gt;I’ve seen seniors who’ve practiced yoga for decades hold poses with more grace and strength than younger people who only dabble in it. And they often say the mental benefits—reduced anxiety, clearer focus—are just as important as the physical ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5539" data-end="5662"&gt;These practices prove that energy isn’t always about speed or intensity. Sometimes it’s about sustainability and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5669" data-end="5684"&gt;6. Cycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5686" data-end="5840"&gt;Cycling isn’t just for young commuters in Lycra shorts. I’ve seen retirees in California cruising on e-bikes or pedaling along coastal trails with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5842" data-end="6068"&gt;What makes cycling powerful is that it gets the heart rate up while being relatively gentle on the joints. Traditional bikes build endurance, while e-bikes allow older riders to scale their effort depending on how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6070" data-end="6303"&gt;This combination of flexibility and freedom makes cycling an energy-boosting hobby that can be adapted as people age. And there’s something freeing about moving quickly under your own power—even if it’s with a little electric help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6305" data-end="6534"&gt;One couple in their seventies I met while traveling through Portugal told me cycling is what keeps their relationship strong. “We’ve ridden thousands of miles together,” the wife said. “It keeps us talking, keeps us exploring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6536" data-end="6639"&gt;That social and exploratory element makes cycling more than just exercise. It’s adventure at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6646" data-end="6668"&gt;7. Playing sports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6670" data-end="6779"&gt;Pickleball, tennis, golf, even ping-pong—the specific sport doesn’t matter as much as the spirit behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6781" data-end="6982"&gt;Sports get people competing, laughing, and connecting. They provide structure (weekly games, friendly matches) that keep people accountable, and they engage muscles that don’t get used in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6984" data-end="7267"&gt;Pickleball in particular has exploded in popularity among retirees. It’s less demanding than tennis but still offers a fast-paced game that keeps reflexes sharp. And it’s accessible—many community centers have converted tennis courts to pickleball courts because demand is so high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7269" data-end="7483"&gt;I’ve seen whole communities of retirees built around these games. They aren’t just exercising—they’re belonging to something bigger. And that sense of play might be the most underrated energy booster of them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7485" data-end="7642"&gt;As psychologist Stuart Brown has said, “Play is not just an activity; it’s a state of mind that helps us stay resilient.” That’s doubly true in later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7649" data-end="7669"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7671" data-end="7783"&gt;Staying full of energy after 65 isn’t about grinding away on a treadmill or following strict fitness regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7785" data-end="7920"&gt;It’s about choosing hobbies that feel joyful, that bring movement naturally into the day, and that connect body, mind, and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7922" data-end="8028"&gt;The people who stay active later in life don’t think of it as “working out.” They think of it as living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8030" data-end="8137"&gt;So maybe the better question isn’t &lt;em data-start="8065" data-end="8093"&gt;which hobby should I pick?&lt;/em&gt; but &lt;em data-start="8098" data-end="8135"&gt;which one makes me feel most alive?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY – Several people were exposed to and infected with measles after attending an event at Soldier Hollow, the &lt;a href="https://dhhs.utah.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Utah Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services&lt;/a&gt; confirmed Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 16, the Utah DHHS reported that approximately 2,000 people attended a Utah High School Cycling League event at Soldier Hollow. The department said it “has confirmed that several people were exposed to and infected with measles,” but did not disclose how many people, or the origin of the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily, even at outdoor events,” Dr. Leisha Nolen, epidemiologist for the State of Utah, said in a release from the department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nolen advised that attendees and participants of upcoming cycling league events check their MMR vaccination status to prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department said it is working to inform people of possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah public health is working with the Utah High School Cycling League to inform families of race participants who attended the Soldier Hollow event on August 16, 2025. We are also working collaboratively to help prevent spread at ongoing practices and upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utah HHS said symptoms usually begin within one or two weeks after initial exposure. Those symptoms can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mild to moderate fever with a cough that later spikes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;runny nose,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;red, watery eyes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blotchy rash appearing first along the hairline and behind the ears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department advised that if you develop symptoms, it’s important to protect others from exposure by staying away from other people and calling your healthcare provider before going to a clinic or hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

How relatively able are they to transmit? And [two], how lethal are they? How serious is the illness that they create, and the number of deaths?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worked on both SARS and MERS before COVID came along. [&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bcm.edu/departments/molecular-virology-and-microbiology/emerging-infections-and-biodefense/specific-agents/sars-mers" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bcm.edu/departments/molecular-virology-and-microbiology/emerging-infections-and-biodefense/specific-agents/sars-mers" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SARS and MERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are severe coronavirus infections that predate COVID-19.] Those were two viruses that basically had the ability to kill 15% to 35% of the people that it infected, but they weren't nearly as infectious because they didn't have the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" target="_blank" data-url="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACE receptor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; capacity. [SARS-CoV-2, in comparison, plugs into the ACE2 receptor on human cells.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then along comes COVID, which basically has this highly infectious characteristic but fortunately, the case-fatality rate and serious illness was substantially lower than what we saw with MERS and SARS. Just in the last six months, there's actually been the isolation of new coronaviruses from bats in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; that actually have both [high infectiousness and high lethality] now. They actually have the ACE receptor capacity as well as that segment of the virus that was responsible for causing such severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So imagine a next pandemic where it's as infectious as COVID was, but instead of killing 1% to 2% of the people [it infected], it killed 15% to 35% of the people. That's exactly the example we're talking about with The Big One.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing is true with influenza. You know, we've not seen a really severe influenza pandemic &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/spanish-flu.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/spanish-flu.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dating back to 1918&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, relative to what it could be. And clearly there are influenza pandemics there, in a sense, waiting to happen. In the future, someday, that could easily be similar to or worse than what we saw with 1918 flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we're trying to give people a sense that nobody's dismissing how severe COVID was, or what it did. It was devastating. But devastating with a "small d," not a "capital D," when you compare it to what could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="5ff90948-f751-478e-a622-4ef88c19f6ac"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Michael Osterholm, author of the book "The Big One: How We Must Prepare for Future Deadly Pandemics," warns that America is not prepared for the next pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Courtesy of the University of Minnesota)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="db3e9cbf-b45a-4576-82c8-f14f12f71ef4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You mentioned both coronaviruses and influenza. Do you think the pathogen that sparks the next pandemic will belong to one of those groups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;We refer to these as "viruses with wings" in our book — you have to have a "virus with wings" to really make it into the pandemic category. I don't think there's a bacteria right now that would fit that characteristic; it really is in the virus family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest likelihood is going to be an influenza [virus] or coronavirus. Sure, there could be a surprise infection that comes up, but it'll have to have characteristics like flu and coronavirus in the sense of respiratory transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: Could you clarify what you mean by "virus with wings?" What gives a virus pandemic potential?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the things that made, for example, SARS and MERS easier to contain was for many of the [infected] individuals, they did not become highly infectious until after they're already clinically ill. But with COVID, we saw clearly a number of people who were actually infecting others when they were still asymptomatic, or they remained asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It [a "virus with wings"] has to have the airborne transmission capability, and that's the key one right there. … It would also be a virus that is novel to the society and that wouldn't have pre-existing immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You make the case in the book that you can't necessarily prevent a pandemic pathogen from taking off, but you can mitigate its harm. Why is that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;I think exactly why we give the reader the scenario, because you can see the conditions on the ground in Somalia. [&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: Throughout "The Big One," the authors return to a thought experiment in which a pandemic virus emerges in Somalia and then spreads around the world, despite efforts by health officials to contain it.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every city, every camp, every clinic, every health care-related event is actually real. But you can see very quickly how a virus that emerged from an animal population — in this case camels — got into humans and how fast it moved around the world before anybody recognized it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="71969cc9-4482-4ba6-80db-dfe5b554d5a4"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;mRNA technology offered us a real hope that we could actually, in the first year, have enough [vaccine] for the world. And of course you saw that was all just taken off the shelf by the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Michael Osterholm, University of Minnesota&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e0ff69d0-f797-42db-b93a-b4f02b6eab39"&gt;These viruses are by nature highly infectious, and in a very mobile society, they are going to move. It just again illustrates that once that leaks out, it's out, it's gone. You can't unring a bell. Whereas other diseases that may be much slower to emerge and less likely to cause widespread transmission, you might be able to get to, but not easily with the pandemic. It's just gone. That's "wings," right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: And when you talk about mitigating pandemics, you make the point that governments must be involved, that industry can't do it alone. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Let me just say: I regret we didn't have six more months on this book. So many things have changed even from the time that the last manuscript went in at the end of last year and now, just because of what's happened in the Trump administration. We have basically destroyed what capacity we had to respond to a pandemic. The office that normally did this work in the White House has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/30/white-house-pandemic-preparedness-office-leaderless-unprepared/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/30/white-house-pandemic-preparedness-office-leaderless-unprepared/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;been totally disbanded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; [that being the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy]. And there's no expertise there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, if we had a major influenza pandemic and we needed vaccine, we'd be using the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-flu-shot-have-low-effectiveness" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-flu-shot-have-low-effectiveness"&gt;&lt;u&gt;embryonated chicken egg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only means we have for any large-volume production of vaccine. Novavax has a cell-based one, but it's very limited how much can be produced. Even with all the global capacity, we could only make enough vaccine in the first 12 to 18 months for about one-fourth of the world. So three-quarters of the world in the first year of the pandemic wouldn't even see a vaccine, and it would take several years more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, mRNA technology offered us a real hope that we could actually, in the first year, have enough for the world. And of course you saw that was all just taken off the shelf by the White House. HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] said no more, $500 million is down. The money had been given to Moderna to actually develop prototypes ready to go so that if we needed them, we wouldn't have to go through the long laborious process of getting them approved. We get them approved now with the strain change issue [left for when a pandemic virus emerges].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And suddenly, that is like losing one of your wings at 30,000 feet [9,100 meters] — it's a devastating situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/these-decisions-were-completely-reckless-funding-cuts-to-mrna-vaccines-will-make-america-more-vulnerable-to-pandemics" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/these-decisions-were-completely-reckless-funding-cuts-to-mrna-vaccines-will-make-america-more-vulnerable-to-pandemics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'These decisions were completely reckless': Funding cuts to mRNA vaccines will make America more vulnerable to pandemics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="1206135f-df01-4c28-af6f-cf512132018d"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Government funding cuts to mRNA vaccine technology are like "losing one of your wings at 30,000 feet," Osterholm said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: SOPA Images via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="c2b7ca87-15a3-4a31-a755-10dba3a1fd3b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: To push the point on mRNA: Do you see its main advantage being the speed of vaccine production?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;What's important here with mRNA technology is in fact the speed, and you nailed that. Both in terms of not only designing the vaccine, but making it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing about it, though, is because of the way you can insert specific antigens into these vaccines [proteins that look foreign to the immune system]. You can take any one piece or several pieces, and actually now there's work going on on multiple antigens into mRNA vaccine, and that would be even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it's much easier [than conventional vaccine manufacturing]. It's like a plug-and-play. Before, we didn't have anything like that. And clearly, we've demonstrated the mRNA approach does cause the human immune system to respond just as we want it to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You also spend a lot of time in the book on the topic of communications — namely, how to better communicate key information in an unfolding pandemic. What do you think is a central takeaway for communicators?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Science is not truth; science is the pursuit of truth. So expect that we're going to learn a lot over the course of time. And I wish I could say to you today what I'll know three years from now, but I'm not. So the best I can do is keep you informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I wrote an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/21/facing-covid-19-reality-national-lockdown-is-no-cure/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/21/facing-covid-19-reality-national-lockdown-is-no-cure/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;op-ed piece in the Washington Post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; early in the pandemic response before lockdowns even got going and I urged not to do lockdowns. "They won't work, don't do them. When are you going to release the lockdown, because this is going to last for months to years?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I suggested was something more akin to a snow day. The most important thing we could do to minimize the number of severe illnesses and deaths was to keep our health care system functioning and to be able to provide that care. Well, we didn't do that well because we have these big bursts of cases. What if we had really had the data on hospital capacity in every community, and we put those numbers up every day? And when we approached, you know, 95% of beds full: "Please, just like we do for snow days, for the next week, if you can back off public interaction, we can get those bed numbers back down." We were in this for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should have done a much better job of communicating that and not just jumping to "lockdowns" because when they ended, then what the hell do you do? We didn't paint this as, "This is going to be a battle for potentially three or four years." We were approaching this far too much like a hurricane situation. "It's going to blow through, it's going to be horrible, but in six hours, 12 hours, we'll be able to get to recovery mode." This wasn't going to happen that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of things I find, throughout my 50 years in the business, is that people want truth. Don't sugarcoat things. At the same time, don't exaggerate; give people the reason as to how you got there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: Given how complicated our information ecosystem is now, I'm not sure if you have an impression of where most people got their updates? Or if it was highly mixed? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;I think that's a very important point. And I would say that no one's talking about having one single unified voice, because there's going to be differences when you're pursuing [solutions] and they'll change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where we needed more humility. I keep coming back to that word humility — to say what we know and what we don't know and how it could change. I think had we done that, we'd be in much better shape in terms of public credibility. When you don't know, say you don't know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You close the book noting that you're often asked what the average person can do. Is there anything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MO: &lt;/strong&gt;Actually this has come into sharper focus with regard to the vaccine issue right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our website, for example, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/osterholm-update" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/osterholm-update" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;when I do the podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we in the show notes list organizations that are working in the community on vaccines and to help support availability, education, etc. Get engaged with them. One of the things we didn't do is use our citizen public health army during the pandemic that we could have. There were some limited outreaches, for example, to the religious, to pastors and so forth, but I think we could do much, much more. Information will not stop the pandemic, but information may minimize the horrible impact that it has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="05c9bcae-ba28-4f0d-bb2e-10eb96132bb8"&gt;When I talk about citizen involvement, they can't go and make vaccines, but they can surely reach out to their elected officials. They can make sure that [harmful] policies are not being made at school boards, or at city councils or in state legislatures. We just had a bill introduced in Minnesota that's starting to get some legs to it, that would &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;amp;f=HF3219&amp;amp;ssn=0&amp;amp;y=2025" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=House&amp;amp;f=HF3219&amp;amp;ssn=0&amp;amp;y=2025" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outlaw mRNA technology as a criminal activity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Literally, if you gave a vaccine, you could go to prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having citizens be able to track this, maintain contact and be able to testify I think is really important. … We have to do more and more, to have citizen watch groups that are alerting people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VIP [&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine Integrity Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative aimed at safeguarding vaccine use in the U.S.] is a good example of this. One of the individuals who presented yesterday at our big meeting is a woman with three kids, who is a mother, a department chief, all these different things — I don't know which 29 hours a day she works, but she's amazing. I said to her, "You know, you've got to take some time off." And she said, "This is too important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what's giving me hope, you know. That's what we have to tap into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-WNbzdbamYCxKMAHNou4oxK-RuHuXk9Q9ta7rRiZCUBFPFIYlzW0pkfQ" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-WNbzdbamYCxKMAHNou4oxK-RuHuXk9Q9ta7rRiZCUBFPFIYlzW0pkfQ slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-5a8b052e-90a8-4b73-9824-3af034c4c713" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv2eis0042t1ktjno3svcg@published"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/09/rfk-robert-kennedy-senate-hearing-bill-cassidy.html"&gt;U.S. senators spent three hours in a hearing room&lt;/a&gt; grappling with an urgent problem. The problem is that even though most Americans trust vaccines and feel safer when they and their families have access to them, the Trump appointee in charge of distributing America’s shots has his doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv2rsk000o3b7a899l0dvz@published"&gt;This hearing was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be about the president’s plan to “make America healthy again.” But for Democrats, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s actions as the secretary of Health and Human Services changed the agenda. We’ve known from the beginning, of course, how Robert F. Kennedy &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; about vaccines. But it’s worth talking about what he’s &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt;. So far, he has fired members of a crucial vaccine advisory committee—something he promised senators he would not do. His Food and Drug Administration has tried to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/health/fda-covid-vaccines-rfk-jr.html"&gt;limit&lt;/a&gt; who can get COVID shots this fall. The secretary booted the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after a disagreement over immunization practices. Then, more than 1,000 government scientists demanded Kennedy’s resignation.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv2rxa000p3b7axu14l6z2@published"&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/WNTranscript982025"&gt;recent episode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of What Next, Mary Harris spoke to Apoorva Mandavilli, a science and global health reporter at the New York Times, about how RFK Jr. put himself between Americans and their vaccines. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv3b3o00193b7axy5d7gbg@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Harris: Some of the former members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices who were fired talked to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/04/cdc-vaccine-policy-acip-covid-choice/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stat News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and they said Americans are losing the ability to choose vaccination. I thought that was an interesting way of phrasing things, because it’s not like your vaccine is being taken away. It’s your choice to have a vaccine. Can you just lay out how this is working? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv38xa000z3b7axlkmpv57@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apoorva Mandavilli: &lt;/strong&gt;Their word choice, “choose to,” is also very important because that’s what RFK Jr. has always said. He wants to give Americans a choice, and he believes they should be able to choose whether they want a vaccine or not.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv3cvt001j3b7aic5luyjv@published"&gt;But the FDA said from the start, as soon as the new leaders came on board, that they were not going to approve vaccines for anybody under 65 without new evidence. And sure enough, that is what has happened. They have approved the vaccine only for people who are older than 65 or for some people who have other health conditions that may put them at high risk. They’re not approving them for healthy pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv3fv7001t3b7avv9re3nn@published"&gt;RFK Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc#:~:text=All%20Things%20Considered-,CDC%20to%20stop%20recommending%20COVID%20vaccine%20for%20kids%2C%20pregnant%20women,pregnant%20women%20and%20healthy%20children."&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; in May that the CDC would no longer recommend the vaccines also means that insurance companies won’t cover them. So now you have a situation where, let’s say, there is a 50-year-old person who does not have any health conditions but wants to get the vaccine because they believe in it, and maybe they don’t want to expose anyone else to it. Maybe they want it because the vaccine does provide benefits, and they don’t want to get sick, or they don’t want to end up in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv3l8n00233b7aa2ow7vw1@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we look at the example of the COVID vaccine, how is policy trickling down to actual access?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;These people will not be able to get the vaccine without finding a doctor who is willing to do that for them off-label, and they might have to pay for it out of pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4s2e002d3b7anawztfhy@published"&gt;Some pharmacies, like CVS and Walgreens, give out tons of shots for adults. They’re actually now saying that they won’t carry the COVID vaccine at all in certain states because of what’s going on. Even in states where you are, in theory, able to get it, the reality is that when you have these kinds of rules, pharmacies are just reluctant to carry the vaccine. They don’t want to get involved in this kind of thing because it’s just too difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="33" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4tpg002n3b7ad5og6b46@published"&gt;RFK Jr. has also threatened doctors who go against the guidelines, saying that they will not be protected from liability if they don’t follow ACIP recommendations. That’s a real deterrent for any doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4vif002x3b7avfdffbds@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it compare to policies worldwide? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4wy400373b7ak3w13rse@published"&gt;One thing that a lot of the COVID vaccine skeptics point to is that the guidelines now are closer to what they are in other countries. Of course, they very conveniently leave out the fact that in those countries, the vaccine is still approved for everyone. So they do actually have a real choice. They can still get it if they want. And many of these countries have national health care. So they’re not worried about the cost for themselves if they want the vaccine. The circumstances are very different, partly because they have a safety net. They have a health care network that takes care of them.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv4yqp003h3b7apfpvb15u@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last week, Florida came out and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/search?q=florida+rids+vaccine+mandate&amp;amp;oq=florida+rids+vaccine+mandate&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIHCAQQIRiPAtIBCDMzNDRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; it will no longer require vaccines to participate in public life, whether that means going to school or whatever else. This is striking because vaccine mandates have been around for a long time and have been controversial for a long time. But they’re definitely a tool of public health to keep all kinds of people safe. So when you heard about what was happening in Florida, what was your reaction? And can you tell that story a little bit? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv51jr003r3b7a7ooso5h6@published"&gt;Florida has a surgeon general who has been very anti-vaccine for quite a while now. He has said many, many things about COVID vaccines that are not true. Even when there was a measles outbreak, he said that kids could come into school without being vaccinated. It’s not surprising that states are starting to go their own way. States have always decided for themselves what to do with various health policies. But what has been important for them is to have this central voice, the CDC, saying, “This is what we think is right,” and then they can just follow that. Maybe they make minor tweaks here and there, but they essentially follow that.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcvtb1d0007357bhacxymmn@published"&gt;But when you have a situation where they can no longer trust what’s coming from the federal government, then they are sort of forced to make their own decisions at a whole other level, where they have to actually review the evidence themselves or entrust their own judgment in a way that they haven’t had to. That’s when you see Florida saying, “Well, I’m trusting my judgment and I don’t think anybody needs to be vaccinated to come to school.” But you’re also seeing West Coast states—Washington, Oregon, and California—saying they’re going to review the evidence on their own. We’re hearing about Northeast states doing that. New York is apparently going to follow its own thing. So this mishmash was predictable when the CDC stops being the central voice that they all listen to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5cw700413b7ark9l421t@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next week, when ACIP meets, are they going to give further guidance? And how do you think their guidance is going to be viewed, given the fact that RFK Jr. just showed up on the Hill and got beaten about the head by senators? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5f34004b3b7aass7a1pq@published"&gt;Insurance companies are still going to cover what ACIP recommends. And there are many states whose state-level recommendations are very tied up with ACIP. Their laws will say that they follow the ACIP guidelines pretty much as they are. So for anybody to break with those recommendations, it would require some work.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5h5o004l3b7acy6vtilw@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wonder if we’re going to see a future where people travel to get vaccines, where one state looks very different than another state, and what that will mean, because of course, we’re all interconnected. States border each other. And so an outbreak in one place doesn’t necessarily stay in one place, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5j6k004v3b7awnsjdms3@published"&gt;It doesn’t at all. It doesn’t stay in one state, in one country. The thing to remember also is that a lot of the money that state health departments have comes from the CDC. So when that budget is cut, which it has been, they have less money. And they have had to lay people off. So at the same time that they’re being asked to make more decisions on their own, or they’re having to make decisions on their own, they have fewer people to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5kjm00553b7av146xm20@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccines are all about prevention, and you don’t see the benefit of them for a really long time. You’re preventing a negative. So when an outbreak does happen, it may happen years after the vaccines are no longer available. Would it then be harder to draw the connection of why it happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Something public health people say a lot is, “When we’re doing our job right, you don’t see us.” So when we start to see more measles outbreaks, or polio, that’s when it’ll become clear what was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5nj3005p3b7ali31wz9t@published"&gt;It’ll also become clearer how intricate this network is. Things go across states, across countries. So you can’t dismantle global health, and you can’t dismantle federal health structures, and still expect things to function OK at the local level. That’s just not how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5qxc00693b7afevqipke@published"&gt;One hard solution that I think has some hope of working, at least to some extent, is that there are medical organizations that are banding together. They are forming a coalition, of sorts, to issue guidance. Essentially, they’re forming a shadow ACIP. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are two of the organizations that are really important here. They have both said that they don’t agree with the ACIP recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcv5soa006j3b7amtu6wqi0@published"&gt;One hope is that there are enough of these organizations that are respected, that they will band together and that states will be able to look to them for guidance. Of course, it still won’t solve the issue of insurance coverage. But that’s the best we can look at, at this point. And there are many efforts along those &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;lines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After about six months of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt;, patients experience T-cell changes such as an increase in regulatory T-cells, a type of immune cell that works to control the activity of other immune cells. These effects were not as evident in early time points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding this sequential pattern may be critical to optimizing the timing and duration of anti-CD20 therapy in MS,” scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-025-13297-5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;First the B cells fall, then the T cells follow: temporal immunological shift with ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Ocrevus targets key protein on B-cells’ surface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. Several immune cell types drive these inflammatory attacks, but B-cells and T-cells are known to play a key role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocrevus is a therapy that’s approved for adults with relapsing forms of MS, as well as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/primary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-ppms/"&gt;primary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;. Administered via an infusion into the bloodstream, the treatment has been shown to reduce disease activity and slow disability progression effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The active ingredient in Ocrevus is an antibody that targets the CD20 protein on the surface of mature B-cells, leading to their death. Studies suggest that B-cell depletion also appears to exert downstream effects that influence the function of various other immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more, scientists in Italy investigated Ocrevus’ long-term impact on the immune system of 15 MS patients. The team used publicly available gene expression (activity) data generated from the patient’s immune cells. Samples were collected at three time points: before, at two weeks, and six months after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Therapy appears to reprogram regulatory T-cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers examined the two-week samples, there were significant differences in several B-cell subtypes and a consistent drop in the activity of B-cell-specific genes. At the same time, there was an increase in anti-inflammatory molecules and an increase in the activity of genes needed for immune cells called monocytes to move toward areas of inflammation. This may be a mechanism the immune system adopts to compensate for the loss of B-cells, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there were no significant changes in the levels of T-cell subsets or other immune cells at this early time point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After six months of Ocrevus, however, the researchers observed significant changes in several T-cell-related pathways that were not seen at two weeks. Those included a significant decrease in the production of inflammatory molecules and reduced activation of CD4-positive T-cells, a type of immune cell that helps orchestrate immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Our data indicate that anti‑CD20 treatment leads to swift B-cell depletion, whereas alterations in T cell-related pathways emerge more gradually and become most noticeable by 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six months of Ocrevus also appeared to reprogram regulatory T-cells, which became more active and resilient, “thereby sustaining [long-term] immunomodulatory efficacy in MS,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “may represent a late biological effect contributing to the long-term efficacy of [Ocrevus] in MS,” they suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suppression of B-cell functions was also maintained at six months and, in several cases, became even more pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our data indicate that anti‑CD20 treatment leads to swift B-cell depletion, whereas alterations in T cell-related pathways emerge more gradually and become most noticeable by 6 months,” the scientists concluded. “Further investigation at intermediate timepoints will be necessary to clarify the true onset of these [gene activity] changes and their value as predictors of long‑term therapeutic outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

However, this association was observed only in participants who began treatment before the age of 12 and was absent in those who started later. The findings were published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2025.111429"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Progress in Neuropsychopharmacology &amp;amp; Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication commonly prescribed for ADHD. It works primarily by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine activity in the brain, which can enhance attention, concentration, and impulse control. The drug is also used to treat narcolepsy, a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically taken orally—via tablets, capsules, or liquid solution—methylphenidate is classified as a controlled substance in many countries due to its potential for misuse. It is sometimes misused by individuals without prescriptions in an attempt to boost academic or cognitive performance, a practice that carries health risks and ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Jung-Chi Chang and colleagues sought to investigate whether cumulative exposure to methylphenidate was associated with structural changes in the brain’s frontal lobes, and whether these changes were related to ADHD symptom improvement—especially in relation to the age at which treatment began. The researchers hypothesized that starting methylphenidate treatment during childhood (before age 12) would be more likely to affect brain development than starting during adolescence or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 89 individuals diagnosed with ADHD and 91 typically developing controls, matched on age, sex, and intelligence quotient. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interferes with daily functioning and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with ADHD were recruited from the child psychiatric outpatient clinic at National Taiwan University Hospital, while control participants were recruited from nearby communities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted at baseline and again approximately five years later (ranging from 2.2 to 9.1 years). Parents completed the SNAP-IV questionnaire to assess ADHD-related symptoms at both time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reconstructed each participant’s methylphenidate treatment history using parent reports and electronic medical records. All ADHD participants had used methylphenidate, and none were treated with other stimulant medications such as dexamphetamine, which is not approved for use in Taiwan. The researchers calculated cumulative dosage by multiplying the dose by the number of days taken between assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who were younger than 12 years old at baseline, those with ADHD showed distinct developmental trajectories in frontal brain regions compared to typically developing controls. In this early-exposure group, higher cumulative methylphenidate doses were significantly associated with increased gray matter volume in multiple frontal regions, including the right paracentral, caudal middle frontal, superior frontal, lateral orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and precentral cortices, as well as the left pars opercularis, paracentral, and superior frontal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increases in volume in some of these same areas—such as the right rostral middle frontal, right paracentral, right superior frontal, and left paracentral cortices—were also associated with greater reductions in oppositional symptoms, suggesting a possible link between frontal brain development and behavioral improvement. However, these brain–behavior correlations did not remain statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants who were 12 or older at baseline did not show significant structural changes in relation to cumulative methylphenidate exposure. However, in this older group, higher cumulative dosage was still associated with greater improvements in inattention and overall ADHD symptoms, indicating that methylphenidate can be clinically effective even when started later, though without the same measurable brain structure associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that early methylphenidate exposure may affect frontal brain morphology and its association with symptom improvement in ADHD. These age-dependent patterns of psychostimulants on brain structure provide further insight into treatment response and disorder progression monitoring,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on potential effects of methylphenidate on young brain development. However, study authors report that there were many more male than female participants in the study and it remains unclear whether the observed effects are gender dependent. Additionally, drug holidays (periods when participants were not taking drugs) were not systematically documented, and thus not included in cumulative drug dosage calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2025.111429"&gt;Age-dependent effects of cumulative methylphenidate exposure on brain structure and symptom amelioration in youth with ADHD: A longitudinal MRI study,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Jung-Chi Chang, Hsiang-Yuan Lin, and Susan Shur-Fen Gau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2025 18:08:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxNUVdrQ2RXY210R3JBWURSVkV6UXhjNng1WDJYX3BUZ3Mycklta3dSZmdaXzI5aTFMUW1QeVkzdUtPWkJ4dko3a3FlRS1oWEtsenNsWXlYeDhuUlhhRlN3eDVERUpWZDc0YU9DckZnSjJXU3FHQ0dYSnNuTVJacnV1eWluQUFqRjlZOFFxYWlDTnNzYUNNOXVvSDZnRVY1ZmMzN2c</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，常用产品正被用于青少年前期的自我伤害- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/09/health/medication-preteen-self-harm-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckmaja001u26qc1qvhccbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children ages 6 to 12 are experiencing a dramatic increase in instances of self-harm –– and they are using common items available around the house, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a00083b6n5q2w5rc6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rate of instances reported to poison control centers of children being exposed to substances has risen by more than 50% since 2000, said study coauthor Dr. Hannah Hays, chief of toxicology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and medical director of the Central Ohio Poison Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a00093b6npkrfu3k9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the number of those cases with suspected suicide or self-harm intent increased up to fourfold, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000a3b6nbjgt5om3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These cases were far more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization for these children,” Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000b3b6nbdy368bi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hays said she noticed seeing more and younger kids experiencing self-harm and suicidality, and she wanted to understand whether there was a real trend borne out in the data. To investigate, researchers analyzed more than 1.5 million reports of substance exposures to US poison control centers across the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000c3b6nfv449lyw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reports to poison control with suspected self-harm intent among 11-year-olds increased by 398% since 2000. The increase was 343% in 12-year-olds, according to the study &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-069753/203713/Poison-Center-Calls-About-Self-Harm-or-Suicidal" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday by Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, a journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000d3b6npxpuvi5r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The substances in the reports included common household products such as pain relievers, antihistamines, cold medicines and vitamins, the study said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000e3b6ny1j7v1zw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have analyzed data about toddlers accidentally ingesting medications and teenagers taking them for harm or recreational purposes, but this study offers important data on the ages in between, said Dr. Jennifer Hoffmann, assistant professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University and attending physician in pediatric emergency medicine at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. She was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000f3b6n8zt1ufnj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And although the data is stronger because of the large number of reports researchers analyzed, instances of ingestion are likely underreported to poison control centers — because families have to think to make the report after something bad happens, Hays said. That means the rates are likely even higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000g3b6ngbykpd83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The increases of ingestions with harmful intent are concerning, but they make sense given the rise in reports of suicidal feelings in younger kids, said psychologist Dr. Christopher Willard, a lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000h3b6n7z7q2xlg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With younger kids, it’s always hard to know if they fully understand the consequences of their behaviors, and what their true intentions are,” he said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000i3b6nystx2moa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The other problem is that many homes have more poisonous substances easily available than in the past, Willard said. Those include medication, cleaning products, supplements and recreational marijuana products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000j3b6ngsfbqq81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the most important lessons to come out of the data is that families should lock away over-the-counter and prescription medications and dispose of old products safely, Hoffmann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000k3b6naatj8thk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With increased access comes increased exposures to all things,” Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000l3b6nbq46et01@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision-making and planning part of the brain doesn’t develop until a person is in their mid-20s, so if kids can access potentially harmful medications, they may make an impulsive choice without fully thinking it through, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000m3b6nnonp1wq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Policymakers can have an impact on access by limiting package sizes for high-risk drugs and expanding the use of blister packages that require a person to pop out each pill individually, Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000n3b6npaf4bpmj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just those few minutes to pop the pills out of the blister pack can be enough to make a child think about what they’re doing, stop, and it can therefore save their life,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000o3b6nxjqkpjqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health care providers can also make a difference by screening for suicide risk and doing routine mental health checks, Hoffmann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000p3b6n02gxu78n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And families need to know what to look for, Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000q3b6n81s2u55f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Children don’t always look at you and say, ‘I’m feeling depressed. I’m feeling like I want to harm myself,’” she said. “Parents can look for changes in their children.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000r3b6nm5awdp1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Signs that something is wrong can include changes in mood, like increased irritability, hopelessness or tearfulness. Changes in behavior such as refusing to go to school and body cues like headaches, sleep or appetite changes can also be a signal to investigate, Hays said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000s3b6nzwu9q55u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If your gut says something’s off, the next best step would be to ask kids directly,” she said. “Then go from there by looping in your safety nets, your school, your counselors, your pediatrician, to make safety plans and get concrete directions on next best steps.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000t3b6nuoa8utjs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Suicide in children is often an impulsive act precipitated by a stressful event, yet many reports show cases of children without a known mental health condition, Hoffmann said. That means there needs to be more universal prevention efforts, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfckof5a000u3b6ns4c0rvy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two deceased &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/westchester/2-dead-dozens-sick-legionnaires-westchester/6387707/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;victims have not been identified&lt;/a&gt;, WNBC reported. One lived in White Plains, and the other lived in New Rochelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westchester County Health Commissioner Dr. Sherlita Amler said the numbers announced Monday represented the &lt;a href="https://westchester.news12.com/health-alert-37-legionnaires-cases-reported-in-westchester" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;total number of infections and deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the summer months, according to News 12 Westchester. The sources of the infections were not revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amler said the 37 cases in the county also represented an increase from 2024, WNBC reported. She said a possible cause was a higher number of 90-degree days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-papQS7n5" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_papQS7n5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes on the heels of a &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/21/legionnaires-outbreak-harlem-sixth-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in Harlem&lt;/a&gt; that killed seven people and sickened more than 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That outbreak was &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/08/29/legionnaires-outbreak-that-has-killed-7-in-nyc-potentially-traced-to-harlem-hospital-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;traced to Harlem Hospital&lt;/a&gt; and a nearby construction site, according to city officials. It was declared over in the last week of August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/legionnaires-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20351747" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;caused by Legionella bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which thrives in warm and standing water. The Harlem cases were traced to air conditioning cooling towers, which were later sanitized and declared safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous outbreaks have been linked to fountains, showers, spas and mist systems used to cool fruit at public markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, four people died from the disease at a &lt;a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/fourth-person-dies-legionella-outbreak-albany-19752625.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;senior living facility in Albany.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He said the health authority can set eligibility for its own vaccine programs, but state-supplied doses make up a small fraction of what’s given in Oregon. He said most people get vaccines that are bought by pharmacies, clinics or hospitals directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="72KFHAEECRBLRCCXSCP2Q6B444"&gt;Modie said doctors and other clinicians already have the authority to recommend and give the new COVID-19 vaccine to their patients as they see fit, as long as it’s within their professional scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6RPB3MBUUNA4TED7ZB7AGYOC6Y"&gt;Modie said the state supports COVID-19 vaccine recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics for children and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for pregnant people.

That means even if a patient doesn’t fit the FDA’s narrow criteria, their doctor may still be able to give them the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20" data-gaid="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DC3FZSPCBNE5VEQ47XSUEFKSTM"&gt;Dresser said the state medical association is waiting for more guidance from Oregon officials on whether physicians prescribing or administering the vaccine will be legally protected and reimbursed by insurers for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21" data-gaid="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6GQQXIYI7ZH5LOIMLRHED4BVW4"&gt;“There’s also a risk for physicians.

This exacerbates nerve cell death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron levels are typically measured in the brain post-mortem by analyzing brain tissue samples, but QSM allows scientists to measure the mineral non-invasively while a patient is still alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers looked at QSM MRI data from 158 cognitively unimpaired patients and established baseline readings for iron for each subject. Then, the scientists followed participants for 7.7 years, collecting updated readings throughout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Findings revealed that higher levels of brain iron in the initial readings, especially in the brain regions important to memory and other cognitive function, were linked to an increased risk of mild cognitive impairment later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Alzheimer's disease, which affects more than 7million Americans, is caused by the abnormal build-up of proteins in and around brain cells.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a transitional stage preceding Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say that their findings provide further evidence of QSM being a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's Disease, detecting abnormal iron accumulation in the brain linked to disease progression before people start to show symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This will allow for earlier detection and targeted intervention for the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There isn't a single 'normal' brain iron level, as iron distribution varies across brain regions and increases with age, but typical ranges exist for specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently there is no cure for dementia or Alzheimer's but the team behind the new study say that&lt;span&gt; clinical trials could test iron-targeted therapies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, the study's senior author and associate professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins University Dr Xu Li said: 'QSM can detect small differences in iron levels across different brain regions, providing a reliable and non-invasive way to map and quantify iron in patients, which is not possible with conventional MR approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Using QSM, we found higher brain iron in some memory related regions that are linked to a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment and faster cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We can use this kind of tool to help identify patients at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and potentially guide early interventions as new treatments become available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Also, besides serving as a biomarker, brain iron may become a future therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the same time, we hope to make the QSM technology more standardized, faster and more widely accessible in clinical practice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings were published in Radiology, a journal of the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubs.rsna.org/journal/radiology"&gt;Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High levels of iron were first reported in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease in 1953 in a postmortem study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Natalie Ive (pictured) was diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a type of frontotemporal dementia, in 2021 at age 48&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gemma Illingworth, from Manchester, was 28-years-old when she was diagnosed with a rare form of dementia called posterior cortical atrophy (PCA). She died three years later&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is a prevalent element in the human body and is needed for major biochemical processes such as oxygen transport and DNA synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The human body obtains iron through various foods, with red meat being one of the best sources, and it is absorbed through the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is important to maintain a delicate balance of iron in the brain; both deficiency and overload can be detrimental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Abnormal iron accumulation has been reported in numerous neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, but it's unclear if increased iron deposition contributes to the development of these diseases or is a secondary effect or by-product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have identified that iron accumulation correlates with amyloid beta – the protein that clumps together in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These clumps form 'plaques' that collect between neurons, otherwise known as nerve cells, and disrupt cell function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Associations have also been found between iron and neurofibrillary tangles – abnormal accumulations of a protein called tau that collect inside neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These tangles block the neuron's transport system, which harms the communication between neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brain maps of healthy control participants and participants with Alzheimer disease. Iron accumulation was associated with cognitive deterioration independently of brain volume loss. (Alzheimer's disease is associated with higher rates of brain tissue loss than normal ageing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is known that deep grey matter structures of patients with Alzheimer's disease contain higher brain iron concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grey matter of the brain is high in neural cell bodies and plays a major part in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But less is known about the neocortex, the deeply grooved outer layer of the brain that is involved with language, conscious thought and other important functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Impaired iron stability for people with Alzheimer's disease indicates that iron chelation therapy, giving patients drugs that rid the body of iron via urine, in clinical trials might be a promising treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="21" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpd8rg000w3b79d3q81096@published"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/theslatest?utm_source=slate&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_plain_text_topper"&gt;Sign up for the Slatest&lt;/a&gt; to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpcv0d00bb9bm7lwu7jsqk@published"&gt;Shana used to love training for triathlons. As a nurse working in the ICU of the University of Chicago Medical Center, she’d often finish a night shift at 7 a.m. and then squeeze in a run on the lake before heading to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcphari001r3b79c5e52dvd@published"&gt;She even completed the infamous Escape From Alcatraz Triathlon—a 1.5-mile swim from Alcatraz Island to the shoreline, an 18-mile hilly bike ride, and an 8-mile run. She’d had asthma since she was a child, but it rarely interfered with her training, usually only flaring up once a year when she had a cold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcphari001s3b79et42jtff@published"&gt;Then her asthma suddenly worsened. One night on the ward, she had a bad attack. She recovered, but had another the next day. And the next. Soon she was nebulizing her medication throughout the day and struggling to walk up stairs. Her doctor put her on heavy doses of steroids to try to calm her lungs.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharj001t3b79peu9edfj@published"&gt;She finally found relief, but it was short-lived. She gained so much weight from the steroids so rapidly—almost 60 pounds in a month—that she had a hard time moving. “Imagine going to the gym, picking up a barbell, and stacking on 60 pounds of plates, then carrying that around with you all day. In the shower, walking down the street, lying in bed. It was horrible,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharj001u3b79penjo9hl@published"&gt;As a nurse, she understood the physiology behind what was happening to her. She knew her throbbing knees and elbows meant fluid was leaking out of her joints. She understood that the pain in her chest was her diaphragm muscle being stretched away from the bone underneath as fluid filled her abdominal wall. And as her face started to swell, she looked in the mirror and recognized the moon face that is a hallmark of Cushing’s syndrome, a condition that happens when your body has too much cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharj001v3b79swm1bdjs@published"&gt;Shana and I met in an online support group. We both have severe asthma, which 8 percent to 10 percent of asthmatics develop: The condition suddenly worsens without a clear reason and stops responding to most medications. Like many patients with severe asthma, we both developed adrenal diseases after having to take huge doses of steroids to manage our frequent attacks. Unlike Shana, I never developed Cushing’s syndrome, which is when your cortisol is too high. Instead, I developed adrenal insufficiency, which is when your cortisol is too low. I can no longer make cortisol on my own and must now take a synthetic form called hydrocortisone several times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcphark001w3b797gt57420@published"&gt;Fortunately, true disorders of cortisol like Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal insufficiency are incredibly rare: According to the Cleveland Clinic, 40–70 people in 1 million have cortisol that is too high and 100–140 people in 1 million have cortisol that is too low. This rarity is why Shana and I, and many members of our support group, are baffled by the “high cortisol” posts flooding social media, and TikTok in particular, which has more than &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/round-face-viral-terms-real-diagnostic-implications-2024a1000kia?form=fpf"&gt;800 million views&lt;/a&gt; of videos tagged #CortisolTok. According to these posts, high cortisol is to blame for a slew of health issues including fatigue, a puffy face, waking up at night, and weight gain (commonly called “cortisol belly”). Many of the influencers posting about cortisol call themselves hormone or weight loss coaches, though they typically don’t have medical qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharm001x3b79hz63yd4u@published"&gt;It’s hard to overstate how essential cortisol is to our bodies. Adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison’s disease, was a fatal condition until hydrocortisone was invented in the 1930s. Nowadays, people with adrenal insufficiency have mostly normal lifespans. But it is still a dangerous disease that can quickly flare into an adrenal crisis, which is when your body doesn’t have enough cortisol, and your organ systems begin to fail. Some studies show that up to 1 in 4 people &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23948-adrenal-crisis"&gt;die from an adrenal crisis&lt;/a&gt;, a tragic reality Shana and I see all too often in our support group.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharm001y3b79wuc8o9no@published"&gt;You wouldn’t know that sad truth from the posts that tend to prescribe the standard wellness remedies of the moment: matcha tea, bone broth, celery juice, and cold plunges. Some are even pricier, like a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNp4XWrOzrT/"&gt;$184 weighted pillow&lt;/a&gt; that promises to help you “say goodbye to cortisol” and a $1,000 &lt;a href="https://yourhealthcoachbiz.com/3-month-cortisol-recovery-program-rachel-feldman/"&gt;three-month online “cortisol recovery” program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-section-div/instances/cmfcphavg002e3b79x2zr1zmt@published" class="section-div"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharm001z3b79ok2nyexk@published"&gt;Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, two tiny organs, each the size of half a walnut, that sit on top of the kidneys. It regulates our blood pressure, helps us digest food, keeps our blood sugar stable, and controls our circadian rhythm. Cortisol is also critical to our immune system. It repairs tissues and acts as our body’s most powerful anti-inflammatory, which is why Shana’s doctor gave her such high doses of steroids—synthetic cortisol—to treat her asthma.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharn00203b79jq7vh4g3@published"&gt;Perhaps the biggest danger of this trend is that people are panicking about their cortisol for no reason. Dr. Rachel Pessah-Pollack, an endocrinologist at the NYU School of Medicine, has seen a surge in patients requesting cortisol tests in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharn00213b794xf4fc0p@published"&gt;One of her first priorities is to help her patients understand that cortisol not only fluctuates throughout the day, but is different on a day-to-day basis. Our cortisol peaks around 8 a.m. and then falls throughout the rest of the day, increasing in little bumps when we eat, drink coffee, or feel stress. It increases with bad stress like a difficult meeting or a stomach bug, as well as good stress like a family reunion or a birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="16" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharn00223b79mevq8bsv@published"&gt;“But those bumps are almost always transient and quickly go back to a baseline,” Pessah-Pollack says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharn00233b79hrzvzdsm@published"&gt;That is why she emphasizes to her patients that cortisol testing needs to be handled and interpreted by specialists. Otherwise, if they use saliva tests at home, as is commonly encouraged on TikTok, they might be unnecessarily spooked when they see their cortisol is all over the map.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharo00243b79fuqy7lqs@published"&gt;Pessah-Pollack is deeply empathetic to her patients’ concerns and tries to get to the root cause of why they’re worried their cortisol is too high. Many of her patients say it’s because they are exhausted or have gained weight. These are two common features of an underactive thyroid, a condition that is thousands of times more common than cortisol disorders, which is why one of her first steps is typically to order blood work to check their thyroid function.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharo00253b79s8pd8x74@published"&gt;If they’re waking up at night, she considers other factors like whether they may have undiagnosed sleep apnea or are drinking alcohol shortly before bedtime. And if they’re worried about weight gain, she helps them analyze their activity level and how their exercise and nutrition needs may be changing with age. Unless she sees the telltale signs of Cushing’s, like stretchmarks on a patient’s thighs and stomach, central obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar, she doesn’t worry that their cortisol is too high.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharo00263b79v5mh6epk@published"&gt;So, how did cortisol get so misunderstood?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharo00273b79d2x8w5ct@published"&gt;Cortisol took off as a buzzword associated with stress after the publication of naturopath James Lee Wilson’s 2001 book, &lt;em&gt;Adrenal Fatigue: The 21&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;st&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt; Century Stress Syndrome&lt;/em&gt;. In the book, Wilson argued chronic stress damages the adrenal glands, which means a lot of people don’t have enough cortisol and feel exhausted and foggy as a result. He coined this condition “adrenal fatigue,” and although it is not a recognized medical diagnosis, it became popular in wellness communities.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp00283b79nbcg3mzf@published"&gt;For years, Google search trends show about equal interest in low and high cortisol. Then, in 2022, searches for “high cortisol” skyrocketed. Around that time, several studies came out linking stress about the COVID-19 pandemic with increased levels of cortisol in health care workers and the general population. Perhaps this contributed to the sudden spike of interest in high cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp00293b79xjpw67lt@published"&gt;It makes sense that this interest has endured. Who &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; need a word to describe the constant panic many of us feel in today’s world, where we are constantly bombarded with anxiety-provoking headlines about climate change, A.I. taking over jobs, and unstable democracies? How could we not be seduced by the hope that an allegedly cortisol-lowering matcha tea or magnesium footbath might quiet our inner turmoil?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp002a3b79vsc7duzw@published"&gt;But cortisol is not a synonym for stress. It is a hormone we need to survive. And this misunderstanding is deeply frustrating to people with adrenal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp002b3b79cspf1p99@published"&gt;When I asked my support group what they wished people knew about cortisol, one woman said she wished people knew how similar Addison’s disease is to Type 1 diabetes, and that if she doesn’t take medication daily, she will die. Another said she wished her friends and family would stop telling her how lucky she is that she can’t make cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharp002c3b79lszfem65@published"&gt;Shana recently switched to a lower dose of a gentler steroid, and her doctor says her Cushing’s should be gone within the year. Her face is still swollen, however, and she is growing weary of posts about “cortisol face.” She’s seen many reasons people have puffy faces in her line of work: too much salt in their diet, alcohol, allergies, even sleeping face down. She hopes that by sharing her story, she can encourage people who are experiencing any unusual symptoms and are worried about their cortisol to seek medical care instead of trying remedies they find online.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfcpharq002d3b79acwpi8w9@published"&gt;She’s already dreaming of her next triathlon, perhaps the Alpe d’Huez in the French Alps. Yesterday she ran 200 yards. She hopes to run a little farther &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
