The announcement has been postponed until the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead of Vinay Prasad, the top vaccines chief, Høeg is listed to speak at the event. She was recently named acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the fifth person to lead the center this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The acting appointment of Høeg could signify a closer partnership between the drug and vaccine centers as Høeg and Prasad consolidate power at the agency – and it signals a greater focus upon dismantling already-approved vaccines at the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg has frequently advocated for ending some childhood vaccine recommendations in the US in order to be more similar to Denmark, a nation with universal health coverage and a population roughly the size of Wisconsin’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So far in public appearances, she has continued to focus on vaccines – typically the purview of Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) – rather than drug regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg’s predecessors reportedly clashed with Prasad when he attempted to pull drug-regulatory employees into vaccine-regulation work, but Høeg and Prasad have worked together closely both at the FDA and by co-authoring research in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg has no apparent experience in drug development, regulation or management, which has been typical for past directors of the CBER. She has worked at the FDA as a senior adviser to the commissioner, Marty Makary, and CBER since March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She doesn’t seem to have any of the qualifications” for running the drug-regulation department, said Jonathan Howard, a neurologist and psychiatrist who has closely tracked Covid contrarians, including in his new book, Everyone Else Is Lying to You. “She’s never run a randomized controlled trial. She has no expertise leading a large organization. She has no expertise in industry regulation or drug approvals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Past directors of CBER would “understand laws and regulations and the science of drug development”, said Janet Woodcock, former acting FDA commissioner and former CBER director. “Objectively, she doesn’t have the kind of background that previous people who ran CBER have had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The drug center has an enormous portfolio at FDA, Woodcock pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Everybody just pays attention to the new drug program, but the generic program approves thousands of generic drugs. There’s a biosimilars program, over-the-counter program and so forth, and all of those have to be looked after,” Woodcock said. “The thing you don’t keep your eye on, that’s the thing that I always told people is going to bite you in the behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is also a significant leadership component to the position, which oversees more than 5,000 employees. “It’s a huge management job, if you do it right,” Woodcock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In response to the Guardian’s questions about Høeg’s qualifications and whether this appointment signifies greater collaboration among FDA leaders on vaccines, the “questions rely on incorrect assumptions”, said Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This background aligns with the responsibilities of her role,” Hilliard said, pointing to the months Høeg spent advising the FDA commissioner on “drug safety and regulatory science, including computational safety modeling and vaccine surveillance”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As acting director, Høeg inherits the commissioner’s new priority voucher program, a controversial one-day drug-approval program that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/15/fda-us-healthcare" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/03/fda-drug-chief-signals-retires-pazdur" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;troubled&lt;/a&gt; her predecessors, Richard Pazdur and George Tidmarsh. “How are these drugs being chosen for this voucher program? Who makes the decisions?” Howard said. “There’s a lot of secrecy going on at the FDA right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, he said, “the FDA seems to be moving towards laxer regulations of all drugs, except for vaccines”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With vaccines, Høeg has a more established, if troubling, track record, Howard said. She published a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13759" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using unconfirmed crowd-sourced reports to determine the rate of heart inflammation after Covid vaccination. She advised the Florida surgeon general Joseph Ladapo, who reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/24/florida-surgeon-general-covid-vaccine-00093510" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;altered data&lt;/a&gt; to suggest Covid vaccines are more dangerous than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Part of her “wish list” for the new Trump administration included changing regulations for new vaccines and ending “unnecessary” vaccines, she &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctor-with-wish-list-more-vaccine-scrutiny-named-assistant-new-fda-chief-2025-04-02/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; after the election on a podcast with Christine Stabell Benn, one of the Danish researchers who recently received a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/19/hepatitis-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-rfk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;controversial CDC grant&lt;/a&gt; to study hepatitis B vaccines in Guinea-Bissau. At the FDA, Høeg has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/12/fda-vaccine-policy-controlled-by-vinay-prasad-tracy-beth-hoeg/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; excluding young men from getting Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She’s an all-around ideologue who starts off with her conclusions and works backwards to retrofit the evidence in a very disingenuous, dishonest way,” Howard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg joined other contrarians, like Marty Makary, Vinay Prasad and Jay Bhattacharya, in sharply criticizing the handling of the Covid pandemic, particularly vaccination; they’ve all been given high-profile positions in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“They’re totally consolidating power, these Covid contrarians,” Howard said. “Everything that’s happening now is a direct consequence of rage and anger over Covid mitigations. These people are furious – livid that their genius wasn’t acknowledged. So they’re on kind of a revenge tour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the pandemic, the contrarians were like “armchair quarterbacks”, Woodcock said. “The problem with that is, they think they can play the game. They can’t play the game. They’ve never played the game, they just criticized every play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Raymond Pollak, an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) adviser and transplant surgeon, pointed out that “our patient population in the United States is very different culturally” from Høeg’s homeland of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Denmark &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/19/denmark-vaccine-schedule-vs-us/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;does not&lt;/a&gt; routinely vaccinate against hepatitis B (at birth), chickenpox, influenza, rotavirus, hepatitis A, meningococcal disease or RSV. As a result, there are tens of thousands of vaccine-preventable diseases each year in Denmark, a nation of 6 million people – less than the population of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are other major differences as well. Prenatal care is free for all in Denmark, and the country has a national health registry. More than 95% of pregnant women in Denmark are screened for hepatitis B, and pregnant people who test positive – and their babies – are monitored to ensure that they are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In comparison, each year, 500,000 pregnant people in the US are never tested for hepatitis B, and many infants born to positive or status-unknown parents are lost to follow-up as soon as they leave the hospital, said Adam Langer, acting principal deputy director and associate director for science at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And the US has different disease patterns and risks compared with most other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The United States is a unique country. I think that most of us would agree that we don’t really have a peer nation in this world,” Langer said at an ACIP meeting earlier this month. The closest might be Canada, he said – and they are moving toward the same birth dose recommendations the US just jettisoned. “So let’s talk about apples to apples, not apples to oranges,” Langer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet Høeg cast doubt on the evidence behind hepatitis B vaccination, stating that “from a regulatory perspective” officials in the second Trump administration “have a very low level of confidence” in saying that these benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks, while presenting no new evidence of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg also featured several anti-vaccine talking points in her comments during a presentation she made on the Danish vaccination schedules to the ACIP. When discussing the number of vaccines a child receives in the US, Høeg questioned the amount of aluminum in each shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I do not feel like we have the data to show that there is an established safe amount that children can receive before the age of two, before the age of 18,” she said, and she also doubted the data on the effects of giving multiple vaccines concurrently. Aluminum adjuvants help vaccines work effectively and have been &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-074874/205757/The-Role-and-Safety-of-Aluminum-Adjuvants-in?autologincheck=redirected" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shown to be safe&lt;/a&gt;, and it is safe to give multiple vaccines at once, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/multiples.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg also took aim at the RSV shots that have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/18/rsv-cases-decline-vaccines-treatment" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dramatically reduced&lt;/a&gt; hospitalization among US babies, claiming that in the trials there was a higher death rate, though she admitted it was “not quite statistically significant”. No such safety signals have been announced in the rollout of RSV shots over the past several years, but the FDA is still &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/rsv-shots-vaccines-rfk-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;launching an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into their safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In December, 12 former commissioners of the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMp2517497" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;penned&lt;/a&gt; a warning in the New England Journal of Medicine about the lack of transparency in announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/fda-vaccine-regulations-unconfirmed-covid-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new changes&lt;/a&gt; to vaccine regulations. In the past, regulatory officials were rigorous about documenting benefits and harms based on publicly available evidence, said Woodcock, one of the signatories to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The commissioners are writing because that is not the process that has been followed, and it’s not generally a scientific process of open debate,” Woodcock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You can just make decisions because you have the pen and say: ‘It’s because I said so.’ But that doesn’t lead to, over time, a lot of trust in the system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxONVpzWG0xMi1JRUsySTJrTk5lUDRQZVlISTVQdXFrU2NZbUJuSGZGYU1pUUlzOFVmMDNSOHhzOUE2M09hdkNmdmd4N2pTZmNPdGJRcWNPdWVKaWlyWURiY2tMTHZ6bFhLOWItcFNBOUF1bkhDaDVVWjVGek9UQ0puZVln</guid></item><item><title>本季流感病例激增的原因。此外，伊朗因经济问题爆发抗议活动- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/12/31/g-s1-104088/up-first-newsletter-flu-cases-surge-venezuela-iran-protests</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates&lt;/strong&gt; that at least 7.5 million people have been sickened, and more than 3,100 people have died from the flu this season. The surge in cases appears to be driven primarily by a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5661508/flu-cdc-health" target="_blank"&gt;new strain of the virus&lt;/a&gt; known as subclade K of influenza A(H3N2), which emerged over the summer in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-104014" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                There have been at least 7.5 million illnesses and 3,100 deaths from flu this season, according to CDC data. And flu cases are expected to rise significantly in the coming weeks.

   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The new strain doesn't seem to be more severe or dangerous than previous ones&lt;/strong&gt;, NPR's Gabrielle Emanuel tells &lt;em&gt;Up First.&lt;/em&gt; Instead, this year's flu vaccine appears to be mismatched against the virus because it was formulated before the strain emerged. Early data from the U.K. show that the vaccine remains effective at preventing hospitalization. Some health experts, however, have &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5662413:nx-s1-mx-5662413-1" target="_blank"&gt;raised concerns that the federal government&lt;/a&gt; has failed to launch a strong flu vaccination campaign.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump's critics say that a strike on a Venezuelan facility is dragging the U.S. &lt;/strong&gt;even closer to a more dangerous conflict. This week, the president revealed new details about an attack against a Venezuelan dock allegedly used to load drugs onto boats. The latest operation marks the first known U.S. strike inside Venezuela — an escalation of Trump's campaign against Nicolás Maduro's government. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧&lt;strong&gt; The strike is significant because it raises the risk&lt;/strong&gt; of killing people who have nothing to do with narcotics trafficking, NPR's Franco Ordoñez says. Up until this strike, the U.S. was targeting some sanctioned oil tankers and boats suspected of trafficking drugs. Both of those operations have &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5662413:nx-s1-mx-5662413-1" target="_blank"&gt;taken place in international waters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran is experiencing its largest protests in years as thousands of people, unhappy with the state of the economy, flood the streets.&lt;/strong&gt; Inflation in the country has skyrocketed, and the currency has plummeted to a record low. Public anger is growing over sanctions against the ruling government. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;Months of anger and frustration over water and energy shortages&lt;/strong&gt;, civil rights abuses and widespread corruption have fueled the current unrest, NPR's Jackie Northam says. These criticisms, combined with the economic protests, have the potential to spiral into something significantly larger. The 12-day war Iran had with Israel over the summer was costly. There is now a widespread belief that Israel will start another conflict with the country, which would &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5662413:nx-s1-mx-5662413-1" target="_blank"&gt;add more economic uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;, Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, tells Northam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Living better&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-103597" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

Package theft, however, can happen any time of year. In fact, the security research company SafeWise estimates that thieves steal about 250,000 packages every day. Sometimes, instead of a new iPad, the thief might swipe a mail order of medicine. Here's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/24/nx-s1-5642562/porch-pirates-mail-theft-medicine-drugs" target="_blank"&gt;what you should do about it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;💊 Schedule deliveries for when you are home. Companies such as CVS Caremark offer customers package tracking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💊 Having a delivery spot that's hidden or even a locker for your porch that doesn't lock can be a good deterrent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💊 See if you can opt into requiring a signature upon delivery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💊 Consider getting medicines delivered to a P.O. box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Picture show&lt;/h3&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At the Plum Island Museum of Lost Toys &amp;amp; Curiosities, one-time treasures find a new home, bring back memories and warn of the permanence of plastic waste. The collection of items started when the museum's founder, Corinn Flaherty, spotted the head of a 1940s-era doll on a deserted beach in 2015. What began as a "hot mess" of stuff in her home evolved into an official museum in Amesbury, Mass., which opened its doors in 2021. The space is a kaleidoscope of color, with carefully curated displays on shelves made from driftwood. Take a look at the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/24/nx-s1-5647280/plum-island-museum-lost-toys-curiosities" target="_blank"&gt;artfully arranged items inside the museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3 things to know before you go&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98990" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tatiana Schlossberg, granddaughter of President John F.

                After caring for his brother, who has schizophrenia, for many years Mitul Desai started a company to support caregivers like him.

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For years, Mitul Desai felt that the best way to deal with his little brother's schizophrenia was to avoid talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His brother had become angry and withdrawn during his first year in college in 1996, and then started hearing and seeing things that weren't there. Over four years doctors told the family he had everything from alcoholism to bipolar disorder, until finally he got the correct diagnosis. It was chaotic and frightening. There were also emergencies — major arguments, trips to the hospital, that time they had to convince the neighbors not to call the police.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Desai compartmentalized. During these years, he focused on the brilliant career he was building as an intellectual property attorney, Wall Street analyst and senior adviser at the State Department. From the office he helped his family by navigating the health care system, talking to the experts and keeping on top of the endless forms and phone calls required to keep his brother stable. His parents, especially his father, handled the day-to-day, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Nobody around him understood what it was like to have a close family member with a severe mental illness, so he kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I felt we were the only family in the world going through this," he says. He and his parents couldn't even talk about their emotions with one other. It was like they were all trapped in their own silos, unable to connect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Slowly the pain of the situation seeped into everything else. Desai was angry, anxious and depressed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, he saved every article he saw about schizophrenia, every research paper or resource, every idea he had about how to fix the problem. He told himself that some day he was going to do something to help — not just his brother, but anyone in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Some day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Every Sunday night, that thought returned. He enjoyed the work, but five years into a high-level corporate job it struck him: Is this really my purpose in life? He quit that week, and started volunteering at the Fountain House, a nonprofit that focuses on peer support and community for people with mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-104055" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;He learned that for serious mental illness, family caregiving and community support are just as &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-0606.2003.tb01202.x" target="_blank"&gt;important to recovery&lt;/a&gt; as the right prescription. Mental health caregivers are the first and last line of defense. Yet they &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5660935/family-caregiver-support-policies-states" target="_blank"&gt;don't get the support&lt;/a&gt; and resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was a turning point. He started planning and working toward a vision to create a new kind of business that would recognize the crucial role of mental health caregivers, and provide them with more help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of the roughly 63 million caregivers in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2019/04/home-alone-revisited-family-caregivers-providing-complex-care.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;23% help someone&lt;/a&gt; with a mental health problem such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Another 4% care for people with addictions.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Caring for someone with one of these invisible illnesses can be particularly stressful. Crises erupt with little warning. Mental health care can be hard to find and confusing to navigate. Friends and relatives are often judgmental or fearful. It's like a secret society that nobody talks about and nobody wants to join.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Learning to see an invisible illness&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Helping someone with a serious mental illness is different from caregiving in the context of common medical problems like heart disease or cancer. Disorders that primarily affect cognition, behavior and emotions are hard to recognize and hard for other people to understand or accept.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many caregivers, the first challenge is often just figuring out what's going on. Symptoms like paranoia, apathy or delusions can be easily confused with stubbornness, bad temper or substance abuse, and someone dealing with these problems may find it impossible to describe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Once they wrap their heads around the situation, caregivers then find themselves becoming the translator.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Caregivers are often faced with the burden of having to educate themselves and other people about the condition their loved ones have," says Dr. Christine Crawford, the associate medical director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most people understand and sympathize with someone who has cancer or a stroke. Not so with mental illness. Friends and family suspect drugs, laziness or bad moral character. Pray it away, they might say — or they blame the family for being too lax, too strict, too &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once you have a relative diagnosed with cancer, you get greeting cards and balloons, as you should," says Desai. "When you have a relative diagnosed with serious mental illness you are greeted with silence. It takes its toll."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Families may find that the stigma of mental illness extends to them, too. After Greg Green's baby girl was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, the family found social support at school and among disability-rights advocates. Now an adult, she's a Special Olympics ambassador, and her dad is on two commissions that oversee policy for people living with disabilities in their state. They found strength in community.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It was a different story when Green's son developed mental health problems as a teenager. The family had to explain over and over again what was going on with him — why he wouldn't make eye contact, or why his body language was awkward and off-putting. And still people didn't get it. Their house had been known for community events and family get-togethers. That all stopped.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was far more difficult to find social support than it had been with his daughter, says Green, and he blames stigma: "I think the number one issue is fear, not wanting to be involved."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-104056" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When friends and family withdraw, it's hard on both the caregiver and the person with mental illness. From the start, Desai was determined to find his brother the best medical treatment available by seeking out the top experts and enrolling him in clinical trials. It was only later that he learned that community and peer support are also essential components of recovery. His family's isolation wasn't just painful — it was actually doing harm.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That experience focused his plans. The company he was creating would train and educate caregiver families, but also combat the stigma and isolation by including peer support — helping build the community that can be so hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Caregiving like no other&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One reason that mental health caregivers particularly need support is that caring for someone with a serious mental illness can be nerve-racking, simply because of the nature of these disorders and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Caregivers often feel they can never let down their guard. People with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder may be quiet and withdrawn for a long time, then unexpectedly slip into a psychotic episode. A bout of major depression can strike for no apparent reason. The caregiver constantly tracks the ebb and flow of symptoms, watching for an alarming shift in mood or cognition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And sometimes a loved one may disengage from treatment or refuse help altogether, and it's the caregiver's job to try to talk them into it. If an adult is considered to be no danger to themselves or another, they cannot be forced into treatment no matter how precarious their situation becomes.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Green's son lived at home safely into his late 20s until his usual medicine went through a shortage in February 2024. (NPR is not using his name in order to protect his privacy in discussing mental health issues.) He was switched to a new drug, which didn't work. The trust between father and son broke down, and the young man eventually decided that the treatment was poison. At the end of May, a conversation about work touched off a massive argument and he stormed out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then he has been homeless, at first in his car, then bouncing between hospitals, treatment centers, and the street. Green says that for months, his son refused to accept anything from him, or even speak with him.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This is not uncommon with mental or cognitive illness. Misunderstandings can boil up into arguments, and caregivers have to think about safety, says Crawford: keeping guns and knives out of the house, locking up medications or even taking the door off the hinges in the person's bedroom to monitor their activity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These tasks are mentally and emotionally draining, points out Marvell Adams, Jr., the CEO of Caregiver Action Network. The job of connecting with someone who is withdrawn or delusional is always a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Caregivers live with the suffering they witness, as well as the frustration of not being able to truly understand the reality of the person they love. Just like with dementia, caregivers may feel they no longer even know the person they care for. It takes a toll, says Adams. It's common for someone supporting a person with major depression, for instance, to develop depression themselves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Green, his son's departure didn't mean his caregiving role was over. It just became more harrowing. Earlier this month, his son was arrested for trespassing at a construction site; Green thinks he was probably looking for a place to sleep. Now, Green is juggling court proceedings and appointments with the motor vehicles office, trying to replace all the documents that were lost during the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His son checks in now and then, but is still living outside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm constantly thinking about him," Green says. Every time he opens his internet browser, he checks his son's medical records, logs in to his bank account to see where he's been, and worries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every night I go to bed thinking: Where is he tonight? It's raining, it's cold. Does he have a place?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He figured out a way to help by passing items like a phone charger or benefits card along to outreach workers, who will give it to him without mentioning where it came from. At night, he racks his brains for more ways to help his son.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Building new supports for family&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A family member's dedication can make all the difference in the lives of people they care for. After years of helping with his brother's mental illness, Mitul Desai learned that the evidence actually proves it: The best treatment for mental illness combines good medical care, peer connections and family support. None of that can happen without engaged, committed caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Recognizing their role is not just better for the person in question; it also benefits the health care system and the hospitals, courts and jails where people often wind up and which aren't equipped to help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Desai launched The CareHack along with psychiatrist Eli Shalenberg. It offers education, coaching and real-time advice for family caregivers dealing with severe mental illness, dementia and other diseases that affect the mind.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-104057" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                When Desai learned how helpful peer and family support is for someone with serious mental illness, he decided to focus his company around helping family caregivers play that role.

                &lt;b class="hide-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;hide caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


            &lt;b class="toggle-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;toggle caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;
        
        José A. Alvarado Jr. for NPR
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The company doesn't offer its services directly to families. Instead, it will work within the system, where Desai thinks they can do the most good. The bet is that the big players in the for-profit health care system will recognize the value that caregivers bring to mental health treatment. The pitch to them: happier, more resilient caregivers reduce expensive hospitalizations and help patients stay healthy and stable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CareHack's customers could include insurance companies that recognize the cost savings that come from supporting and training family caregivers, or large practices focused on mental health and substance abuse so they can offer more granular support to the families who care for these patients every day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Basically, Desai created the support he wished he'd had decades ago. Caregivers can watch short videos or listen to lessons online, or get customized coaching from experienced social workers. They also get hooked up with other families in similar situations, to problem-solve and share stories together, overseen by a moderator. These services are free to them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Desai's business is now working with one multi-state practice, and launching a Medicaid-funded project in New York State. They plan to run a clinical trial, a formal test, of the CareHack model to demonstrate its value for their potential partners.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, caregivers can find information and advice from nonprofits with specialized mental health programs. NAMI offers a free eight-week peer-led &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/support-education/mental-health-education/nami-family-to-family/" target="_blank"&gt;training course&lt;/a&gt; as well as family therapy clinics targeting the first episode of psychosis. Caregiver Action Network recently created a &lt;a href="https://www.caregiveraction.org/blueprint-for-mental-health-issues/" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to caring for cognitive and behavioral problems, and launched an online peer-to-peer network to connect caregivers with advocates who offer advice and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Being prepared for a crisis can potentially make a big difference. Carers and their loved ones can collaborate during stable times to create a mental health &lt;a href="https://nrc-pad.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"&gt;advance directive&lt;/a&gt; that spells out who should make decisions during a critical situation, and what should be done to calm things down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when a crisis comes, there are often better alternatives than calling 911. The nationwide 988 lifeline, rolled out in 2022, is intended for mental health emergencies. Counselors rather than police dispatchers answer the 988 call, and if necessary dispatch a crisis response team with training in mental health. Green also recommends calling the non-emergency line for the local police or the nearest psychiatric hospital's crisis team.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both Desai and his brother are doing better these days. His brother is at an assisted living facility near their parents. Desai has spent time processing his experiences, recognizing the way he is affected by feelings like survivor's guilt — his grief at knowing his brother will never get to enjoy some of the simple pleasures in life, like hanging out with friends on a Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dealing openly with his brother's illness has taught Desai grit, resilience and what he calls extreme empathy: "The minute I meet somebody who has this experience, I'm just bonded."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He will not be able to cure his brother, or lift the stress from his parents. But what once felt like a failure, a source of shame and stigma, now has a purpose: a promise that other families will not have to endure this alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.katmcgowan.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kat McGowan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a caregiving reporter based in Berkeley, Calif.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The Duke University Health System stated in a press release that hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers will temporarily limit patient visitations, effective Tuesday, Jan. 6.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts0ybv00df3ckpj9bbsjec@published"&gt;For some godforsaken reason, my twin sister has decided that some 50-year-old sad sack, less than a year into his divorce, is her new soulmate. His oldest child is less than seven years apart from us in age. He left his wife of 25 years because he was “afraid of not living.” He just is begging fate to be 20 again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jd1000n3b79awaat5k0@published"&gt;Our group of friends is very centered on the outdoors. We hike, bike, camp, swim, and sail. My sister’s boyfriend brags about being able to do all these activities, but he can’t. We are left with a whining man-baby who can’t bother to pack sunscreen or extra water, and our entire trip draws to a screeching halt while my sister plays nurse. It is so cringe that most of my friends don’t want to see my sister anymore. I tried to point out to her it’s because she and her boyfriend refused to stop doing activities he couldn’t physically do and then complained that they were left behind. But she wants to play martyr here! She says no one understands their love or their “amazing connection.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="185" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jex000o3b79idlo1on7@published"&gt;Then she called me to tell me about the trip she went on with his friends, where she tried to “bond” with his kids! Apparently, his friends treated her as an idiot and an infant, while his kids directly told her fuck off. I just started to laugh. It was the worst type of cliché. Did she really, in her heart of hearts, expect to get a warm welcome from them? She &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t warmed up to our stepmother despite our dad getting remarried several years after the divorce (and they’re the same age, at least). She told me I was unsupportive and called me names, so I asked her why she told me to tell her the truth and then expected a lie? This guy wasn’t into her for her “old soul,” he wanted to screw someone young and hot. She hung up on me and blocked me on social media. Our parents are furious with me. They say I pushed my sister back into the arms of a predator and are afraid that she is going to get pregnant to define their “love.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jgy000p3b7998z0qp55@published"&gt;Honestly,  I am angry with my twin for being so smart and acting so stupid here, and I am tired of cleaning up after her mess. I have been doing it for months. It isn’t like the guy is rich or handsome. He’s just pathetic and desperate. So what now?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jiz000q3b797o7hk2pq@published"&gt;—Bad Cliché&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jmv000s3b79st5fyejy@published"&gt;I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I think you screwed up big time here. One of the enduring facts of life is that, occasionally, your friends and relatives are going to date people that suck. This guy certainly seems to fit the bill. I, too, would totally get annoyed at this unmoored Gen Xer nursing his swollen ankles on a hike he begged to go on. But outside of this weird interaction your sister had with his kids and friends—which does seem pretty bad!—I am not detecting anything that would require an immediate intervention. Your diagnosis is spot on. Your twin, indeed, appears to be enmeshed with a mid-life weenie who is attempting to fill a gaping void with the attention he believes he is owed from younger women. But while that’s never a great place to be, it’s also a tale as old as time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5joy000t3b79kzmtzn18@published"&gt;Here’s the thing though: Eventually whatever honeymoon period these two are enjoying will flicker out. At that point, when this man transforms back into the greying divorcée who doesn’t know how to pack for a camping trip, she will begin to complain about him. It appears that has already happened! Your twin beseeched your guidance, but you responded in a way that left her feeling stupid and more dug-in. That’s not the move! When anyone gripes about a partner you hate, you need to tread &lt;em&gt;carefully. &lt;/em&gt;Validate her concerns! Be sympathetic about the things she likes about him! But also, be ready to surgically unveil the numerous traits about his character that you find undeserving of her love. Because, remember, it is your sister’s well-being that is important here. There is a time and a place for the I-told-you-so gloating, and it is a group text that she isn’t in.&lt;/p&gt;

My sister is a single mom and recently moved closer to us, so we’ve been spending a lot of time with her and her young son. My husband’s been amazing with him.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716f00183b79npj2smhr@published"&gt;He plays with him all the time, gladly takes him places, and seems to genuinely love being with him. It has everyone who knows us, including my parents, constantly telling me what a great dad he’d be and how “we should really have kids.” It’s awful. Seeing my husband happily playing with the kiddo has me questioning whether he is really happy being childless (he insists he is), and every comment cuts at my newfound insecurity about our relationship. I am dreading spending time with friends and family, particularly over the holidays, because I know I will be fending off well-meaning remarks that make me want to lash out. I’d really appreciate a script to shut down the comments before they start or an approach to preventing them altogether, preferably before I punch somebody.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716g001a3b79gtdafoxk@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Mind Your Mouth,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="167" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716g001b3b79mi373x0n@published"&gt;So here’s the thing. The persona that your husband has embodied—and the same one that is open to you—is that of the “fun uncle,” or “fun aunt,” which are two of the most sacred and beloved characters in American family life. In fact, I’d reckon that it is imperative among us childless millennials to fulfill that role for the good of our collective social hygiene. Show up, rile up the nieces and nephews, have a couple gin and tonics, and head home with the sublime peace of mind that whatever fallout lingers around the corner (bath, bedtime, ugly public meltdowns) is not your responsibility. What I am trying to say here is that there is not a one-to-one correlation between being “good with children” and “wanting children.” If you and your husband have come to a genuine consensus about how you envision the rest of your marriage—and that it won’t include kids—then I seriously don’t think you need to worry that he’s harboring some hidden progenic desires.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="166" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716i001c3b79bl8l740v@published"&gt;Now, onto the more important matter. Your relatives needling you about your stewardship of the family tree is &lt;em&gt;absolutely &lt;/em&gt;bad behavior. But any attempt to tamp down those comments in a curt, decisive way—while gathered around the tree on Christmas Eve or whatever—is likely going to leave everyone in the room feeling a little awkward. I am going to guess that those child-rearing remarks are coming from a place of good-faith cluelessness, and while I don’t know the kind of relationship you have with your mother and sister, I’d like to think that the issue could be defanged with more empathy in private. I think something soft but direct—”hey, the way you always tell my husband and me that we’d be great parents makes me feel funny,” perhaps during a walk around the neighborhood—could be a jumping off point for a conversation on a tender subject. That is, of course, if the parties involved understand that it’s OK to not want kids, which they obviously &lt;em&gt;should. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716i001d3b794nu2t0qz@published"&gt;One last observation: Regardless of your and your husband’s ambivalence towards expanding your own family, I do get the sense that he &lt;em&gt;likes &lt;/em&gt;kids more than you. And that’s OK! We all have our tolerance levels. But I’d recommend that you get down on the carpet and try to play with your nieces and nephews, next time you see them. Join in on the fun! It might provide some clarity to the family dynamic, and you might be surprised by how much you enjoy yourself. Become the Fun Aunt, and everything else will fall into place naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the years, it’s expanded to include their own longtime friends as well. Those of us who are local still hang out regularly on the weekends, and we game together on Discord every week and stay in touch with some of the guys who have moved away through there.  I would say I generally know the basic facts of what’s going on in each guy’s life, but the problem I keep running into is how to help one of them when they’re clearly not doing well. Over the past year, I’ve seen some of them go through it: one of them is getting a bit too into sports online betting, another was laid off and keeps having no luck in finding another job, one of them has alluded to feeling down about being “directionless” in life, etc. But the only way we hear about these things from each other is through passing comments, and we never really go much deeper than that. I want to be there for them, but it’s hard to figure out how. It feels like we’re all facing real-life shit now, and it’s difficult to figure out how to help them or bring up the subject when half the time we’re just preoccupied talking about our shared hobbies instead.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, I would argue that you are already in a prime position to spark up the deeper conversations you want to be having with your friends. There is an old joke about how straight men can only bond with one another when they are relying on some sort of a buffer—be it a football game, a Nintendo Switch 2, or whatever else—to tamp down the tension of, like, eye-contact, or whatever topsy-turvy weight we’ve collectively put on one-on-one hangs. This, unfortunately, is 100 percent true. I have had deep, soul-searching inquiries about, like, the nature of mortality, or the nuances of marriage, or the unforgiving job market, while simultaneously calling a cornerback blitz in &lt;em&gt;EA Sports College Football 25. &lt;/em&gt;The hobbies you guys share are the ideal conduit to delve into all of the heavy stuff, in an environment that nonetheless feels pretty chummy and casual.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Yes, some of the crises your friends are facing are tough to navigate (in particular, I’d be gentle while approaching a problematic sports-betting habit), but your desire for deeper conversations here can be quickly ameliorated by simply &lt;em&gt;shooting the shit&lt;/em&gt;, ideally with some &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; and maybe a six pack of High Lifes coloring in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;One September day earlier this year, Natalie Cook brought her 2-year-old foster daughter to the park. Like most kids, Cook's daughter loves going down the slides and riding the swings. For Cook, however, these outings can be stressful. Her foster daughter was born prematurely, and she uses a walker to get around.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I never know how the kids are going to react with her walker," Cook said. "Some kids will run off with [it], or they just stare at her."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On this particular outing, things were going well. Cook's daughter was going from one piece of equipment to another, having a nice time. After a few minutes, a boy approached and asked, "what's wrong with her?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I froze," Cook recalled. "I wasn't sure how to explain her disability to an adult, let alone a child."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cook explained that her daughter had been born much smaller than other babies, and that it's taking some time for her to catch up with other kids her age. Satisfied with Cook's answer, the little boy ran off to play with his friends. But after a few more minutes, he returned and began playing with Cook's daughter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He was pushing her on the swing, and then he started to even pick up on the sign language I was using to ask her if she wanted to 'keep swinging' or to '[be] done.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon, the boy had convinced his friends to come over and join.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He started telling them about her disability and what she &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do, not what she couldn't do," Cook said, laughing. "He was like a proud little mom."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before she knew it, the whole park was cheering Cook's daughter along. Seemingly everyone there picked up on the sign language and helped her navigate the playground equipment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was just in awe because I've never seen anything like this at the park. And my heart was just so, so full," Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"[The little boy] saw past her disability. She was just another kid to him, and he could include her in his day. It was just a really sweet moment to know there's still kids out there like that, and [that] my daughter's going to be in good hands as she gets older."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/myunsunghero/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Unsung Hero is also a podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — new episodes are released every Tuesday.

    &lt;p&gt;Rarely does a single study change the course of gynecological history. But a clinical trial published this year in The New England Journal of Medicine did just that, seeming to close the door on one of the great enigmas of women’s health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is the most common vaginal infection worldwide. If you have a vagina, there’s a 1-in-3 chance you will have BV at some point in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, doctors have known that the bacteria associated with the condition could also be found on the penis. Yet on paper, BV was just a vagina problem — it’s right there in the name, vaginosis. For 50 years, gynecology treated it as if it were solely a women’s issue, with ineffective treatments that left women vulnerable to reinfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New England Journal study changed that. The researchers followed 150 heterosexual couples in which the female partner had bacterial vaginosis. They treated the women with first-line antibiotics, and half the men with both oral and topical antibiotics. Within three months, they found, the partner treatment worked so well that they had to disband the study so all participants could be treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their conclusion: BV could be transmitted via sex, and should be treated like a sexually transmitted infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For doctors who treat the condition regularly, the study results felt like a vindication. “It’s just so obvious,” said Dr. Sarah Cigna, a gynecologist who runs a sexual health clinic at George Washington University. “It’s not rocket science.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study spread like, well, an STI. In October, the American College of Obstetricians &amp;amp; Gynecologists advised its more than 60,000 members to begin offering treatment for male partners of patients with persistent BV. In November, California became the first state to recommend that all providers treat male partners. And this month, New York City announced that all its sexual health clinics would now treat male partners as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is going to change practice in a profound way,” said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, and a medical consultant for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of STD prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the journal article came out, some doctors have started calling BV a sexually transmitted infection when they talk to patients. Others, like Cigna, are more hesitant, in part because they believe the stigma of an STI still outweighs the stigma of a vagina problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that there is debate at all shows that the definition of an STI is still in flux, said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine and public health at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologically, most conditions classified as STIs defy binary definitions. The word “sexually,” for starters, rarely tells the full story. “When people hear ‘STI,’ they think penis went into vagina and caused infection,” Cigna said, when in reality sex encompasses far more than penile penetration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the category of STIs were a conflict-ridden country, BV would be a town on one of its ever-shifting borders. The condition changes hands depending on the era and the situation, revealing that those borders were largely artificial to begin with — and making some doctors question the limits of this construct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;STI or not? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacterial vaginosis challenges the conventional definition of an STI in several ways. It isn’t caused by one infecting agent, like chlamydia or gonorrhea. Instead, it is more of an ecosystem shift in the vaginal microbiome, the teeming community of bacteria that patrol the genitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a gemisch of stuff,” said Dr. Caroline Mitchell, a gynecologist and director of the vulvovaginal disorders program at Massachusetts General Hospital. “It’s not just one thing, it’s a pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, BV can be transmitted through sex, but researchers disagree about whether it always begins that way. Even Dr. Catriona Bradshaw, the lead author of the study and a clinician at the Melbourne sexual health Center at Monash University, is circumspect: “It’s better to think of BV as being sexually transmissible,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They know that once you’ve had it, any change in the pH of the vagina can allow BV bacteria to proliferate, said Dr. Lonna Gordon, an adolescent medicine specialist at Nemours Children’s Health in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That change could be set off by douching, condoms, smoking, lubricants, toys, an IUD, hormones, semen or a menstrual period. “You just need to have something that disrupts that environment, which could be a bubble bath, wearing a swimsuit too long, yoga pants,” Gordon said. Yes, yoga pants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By bringing all of these exceptions together, BV is forcing researchers to examine a long-overdue question: Is the term STI still clinically useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole conversation maybe needs to change,” said Dr. Supriya Mehta, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois, Chicago, who studies STIs and the genital microbiome. “Like, who cares about an STI? It’s just a cold that happens to be in your vagina or penis, right?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what doctors call BV, the failure to recognize that it spreads sexually has meant that doctors have been deprived of a critical method for eradicating an incredibly widespread condition, with profound consequences for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything for the vagina is behind, always,” Cigna said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A feeling of liberation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Cigna fought BV with one hand tied behind her back. Every doctor who treated the condition regularly could see that patients were being reinfected, either by a new partner or the same partner.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;But without clinical guidelines, she could treat a patient who had BV only with antibiotics or, as a last resort, a microbiome-decimating medication known as boric acid. These methods seldom worked over the long term. For more than half of patients, bacterial vaginosis comes back within six months of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a major problem. Besides causing irritation, discharge and an unpleasant smell, the condition can worsen pregnancy outcomes and make it easier to get HIV, herpes or another STI, a burden that falls disproportionately on Black women and other women of color. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “cure” often compounds the problem. Many patients are prescribed numerous rounds of antibiotics, which can lead to antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we currently do for BV is so bad that people are jumping on this bandwagon,” said Mitchell at Mass General. “We’re all desperate for something more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some patients, thinking of BV as an STI is liberating. One of Cigna’s patients, a 29-year-old transgender man who had struggled with chronic BV for nearly a decade, brought the study in to his appointment in April after coming across it on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man, who asked not to be identified to avoid discrimination by future employers, said he had always chafed at his doctors’ insistence that BV was a vagina problem, “considering that I pretty exclusively got it from sex,” he said. “It just seemed a little bit, like, blamey, to me.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if BV was sexually transmitted, it meant his partner could be part of the solution. He and Cigna entered the appointment with the same idea: Maybe partner treatment could be an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the study, Cigna was able to recommend that he take boric acid — he had already undergone more than six rounds of antibiotics — while his partner was also treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Not a ‘you’ problem, a ‘we’ problem &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most advancements in modern gynecology, the discovery of bacterial vaginosis can be traced back to a male doctor experimenting on his patients without consent. The physician, Dr. Herman Gardner, suspected that BV must be a result of some pathogen being transferred back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1955, Gardner performed an experiment to find out. He transferred vaginal fluid from 15 women who had BV into the vaginas of women who did not have the condition, and he allowed the newly infected women to pass BV on to their unsuspecting husbands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon culturing bacteria from some of the husbands, Gardner declared BV to be “the most prevalent and one of the most contagious” of all STIs. For his efforts, Gardner’s name was forever enshrined in the species of bacteria most associated with BV: Gardnerella vaginalis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the decades since, a handful of studies have tried to replicate the findings using more ethical practices. All failed, leaving doctors with the impression that BV was not actually a sexually transmitted infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were hints that those studies were flawed. Researchers knew that recurrence was much higher in women who had a regular sexual partner or who did not use condoms. They also knew that the vaginal microbiomes of women who were partners with women resembled each other under the microscope; if one had BV, the other probably did, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So why wouldn’t it be transmitted between penises and vaginas?” Bradshaw asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She attributed the failure of past studies to paltry funding, shoddy research design and the challenge of getting men to commit to studies that do not benefit them personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, Bradshaw was listed as one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in health for “reframing a ‘women’s issue’” as a public health issue. No longer was BV a shameful, secret “vagina problem.” Now it was a problem shared between members of a sexual partnership. Not a “you” problem, but a “we” problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how some people seem to defy the aging process entirely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at a trail race last month, chatting with a woman I assumed was in her early thirties. We talked about training schedules, favorite routes, the usual runner stuff. Then she mentioned celebrating her 55th birthday the week before. I nearly choked on my water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens more often than you'd think. And after years of observing these ageless wonders, both on the trails and in everyday life, I've noticed they all seem to dodge certain habits that the rest of us fall into without thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: looking younger isn't just about good genes or expensive skincare. The people who genuinely appear decades younger than their chronological age? They've figured out that what you don't do matters just as much as what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me share the six common habits these age-defying folks consistently avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Sitting for hours without moving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that woman from the trail race? When I asked about her secret, she laughed and said, "I treat sitting like smoking. Small doses only."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had a point. Those who look significantly younger rarely plant themselves in one spot for hours on end. They're the ones taking walking meetings, using standing desks, or doing what I call "movement snacks" throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I worked as a financial analyst, I'd sit for eight, sometimes ten hours straight, only getting up for bathroom breaks. My body felt decades older than it should have. These days, I set a timer every hour. Sometimes I do ten squats, sometimes I walk around the block. Nothing dramatic, just enough to keep things flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research backs this up too. Extended sitting accelerates cellular aging and affects everything from your posture to your skin's elasticity. Those who look younger? They've figured out that movement isn't just exercise. It's a lifestyle choice that happens all day long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Constantly stressing about things they can't control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know that person who always looks haggard and worn down? Usually they're the ones losing sleep over news headlines, obsessing about other people's opinions, or spiraling about hypothetical disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The age-defying crowd? They've mastered the art of letting go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be a world-class worrier. At 36, I hit a wall so hard that therapy became non-negotiable. My therapist introduced me to this radical concept: if you can't directly influence something within the next 24 hours, it doesn't deserve your mental energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds simple, right? But watch someone who looks twenty years younger than their age. They'll express concern about important issues, sure, but they don't carry that tension in their shoulders or wear it on their face. They've learned that chronic stress literally ages you at a cellular level, affecting everything from your telomeres to your collagen production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These folks have boundaries with their worry. They stay informed without becoming consumed. They care without carrying the weight of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Eating processed foods as their main fuel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look decades younger? Their shopping carts tell a different story than most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're not necessarily following the latest fad diet or counting every calorie. But walk through a grocery store with them, and you'll notice most of their food doesn't come in packages with ingredient lists longer than a CVS receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I switched to a plant-based diet, something interesting happened beyond the expected energy boost. My skin changed. Not overnight, but gradually, people started asking what I was doing differently. Was it a new moisturizer? Had I started getting facials?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Just real food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who age slowly treat food as information for their cells. They understand that what you eat literally becomes you. Your skin cells, your brain cells, everything regenerates using the materials you provide. Feed your body preservatives, artificial colors, and mysterious chemicals? Don't be surprised when you start looking preserved yourself, and not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Skimping on sleep to be "productive"&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know the quickest way to add years to your appearance? Pull a few all-nighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ageless ones? They guard their sleep like a precious resource. Because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wake up at 5:30 AM to hit the trails, which means I'm in bed by 9:30 PM most nights. Friends used to tease me about my "grandma bedtime." But here's what they don't see: while they're scrolling through their phones at midnight, their bodies are missing out on crucial repair time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is when your body produces growth hormone, repairs damaged cells, and consolidates memories. Those who consistently get seven to nine hours don't just look younger. They think clearer, move better, and handle stress like champions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "I'll sleep when I'm dead" crowd? They're aging themselves into an early grave, one late night at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Avoiding discomfort at all costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something counterintuitive: the people who look youngest are often the ones who regularly choose discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold showers. Challenging workouts. Learning new skills that make them feel like beginners. They seek out experiences that push them beyond their comfort zones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started trail running at 28, I was terrible at it. Gasping for air, tripping over roots, getting passed by people twice my age. The analytical part of my brain screamed at me to quit and find something I was naturally good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something magical happens when you regularly challenge yourself. Your body and mind stay adaptive. You maintain what researchers call "cognitive flexibility." You literally signal to your cells that you're still growing, still evolving, still vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comfort-seekers? They're slowly fossilizing, one easy choice at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Living in the past or future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final habit that ages people prematurely? Time travel. Not the sci-fi kind, but the mental kind where you're constantly reliving past glories or mistakes, or anxiously planning for a future that may never come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who look decades younger have an almost Buddhist approach to time. They're present. Really present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think meditation was too "woo-woo" for my analytical mind. Then I tried it out of desperation during my burnout recovery. What I discovered wasn't mystical at all. It was practical. When you're fully engaged with the moment you're in, you're not wearing yourself down with regret or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch someone who looks far younger than their years. They listen when you talk. They taste their food. They notice the sunrise. They're not checking their phone every three minutes or mentally rehearsing tomorrow's meeting during dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presence shows up in their appearance. Their faces aren't etched with worry lines from future fears or frown lines from past resentments. They age in real-time, not accelerated by mental time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking younger than your age isn't about finding the fountain of youth or spending thousands on treatments. It's about what you choose not to do every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habits that age us fastest are often the ones we don't even realize we have. They're the default settings of modern life: sitting too much, stressing constantly, eating convenience foods, sacrificing sleep, avoiding challenges, and living anywhere but the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking these patterns isn't always easy. Some mornings, I still want to skip my run and scroll through my phone instead. Sometimes I catch myself spiraling about things beyond my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what I've learned from those ageless individuals I meet on the trails and in life: youth isn't just about how many years you've lived. It's about how much life you put into those years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by picking just one habit to avoid. Notice how it makes you feel. Then maybe add another. Small changes compound over time, just like aging itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice is yours. You can follow the default path and age according to schedule. Or you can join the rebels who refuse to act (or look) their age.&lt;/p&gt;

Further down the line, they could help pinpoint &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/50-year-old-theory-on-schizophrenias-voices-confirmed-by-recent-study"&gt;brain irregularities&lt;/a&gt; that might be targeted &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-new-schizophrenia-treatment-in-decades-a-much-needed-alternative"&gt;with treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brainquake-discovery-could-change-what-we-know-about-schizophrenia"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; are currently diagnosed based on a person's clinical symptoms rather than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus-traces-discovered-in-the-brain-lining-of-people-with-schizophrenia"&gt;biological markers&lt;/a&gt;.

(Cheng et al., &lt;em&gt;APL Bioeng.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain organoids were engineered using blood and skin cells from people diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, and from people not diagnosed with any &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-shows"&gt;psychiatric conditions&lt;/a&gt;. That gave the researchers three categories of mini-brain to study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzed on a microchip and hooked up to a variety of sensors, the organoids are just 3 millimeters across (about a tenth of an inch), and were engineered to grow neural cell types from the brain's prefrontal cortex. This region &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-wrinkles-are-way-more-important-than-we-ever-realized"&gt;plays a significant role in 'higher' cognitive functions&lt;/a&gt;, such as planning and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of machine-learning algorithms trained to detect patterns in neural communication, the team identified neuron activity unique &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/owning-a-cat-could-double-your-risk-of-schizophrenia-research-suggests"&gt;to schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; and bipolar disorder. These signatures were sufficient to correctly label the source of the cells in the organoids with 83 percent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That accuracy rose to 92 percent when the mini-brains were given electrical stimulation, suggesting that the distinct neuron behavior is more pronounced – and easier to spot – when the brain is actively engaged &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-to-know-if-somebody-is-truly-listening-count-their-blinks"&gt;and at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least molecularly, we can check what goes wrong when we are making these brains in a dish and distinguish between organoids from a healthy person, a schizophrenia patient, or a bipolar patient based on these electrophysiology signatures," &lt;a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/09/22/schizophrenia-bipolar-disorder-brain-organoids/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kathuria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As useful as these mini-brains are, they're still far less complex and nowhere near as functional as the real thing. So there's still plenty of work to be done here in terms of matching the patterns identified in this study with neural signatures in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-has-a-hidden-rhythm-and-it-may-reveal-how-smart-you-are"&gt;actual human brains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-where-extreme-moods-of-bipolar-disorder-exist-in-brain"&gt;Scientists Pinpoint Where Extreme Moods of Bipolar Disorder Exist in the Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these are valuable indicators in understanding how the brains of people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder might function differently. Every step forward in understanding &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-that-age-faster-may-drive-schizophrenia-research-finds"&gt;how these conditions alter brain activity&lt;/a&gt; brings researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-acne-medication-linked-with-30-lower-schizophrenia-risk"&gt;closer to improved treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our hope is that in the future we can not only confirm a patient is  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="187063" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenic&lt;/a&gt; or bipolar from brain organoids, but that we can also start testing drugs on the organoids to find out what drug concentrations might help them get to a healthy state," &lt;a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/09/22/schizophrenia-bipolar-disorder-brain-organoids/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Kathuria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0250559"&gt;&lt;em&gt;APL Bioengineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The New York State Department of Health &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/flu-cases-record-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that it had seen about 71,000 cases for the week that ended Dec. 20 — the most ever recorded in one week since the department began tracking the illness in 2004. There were over 3,600 flu hospitalizations recorded in the state during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Department of Public Health also recorded "high" flu activity. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flu-season-massachusetts-vaccine/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Boston announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a 114% increase in recent flu cases, with children seeing the biggest increase in cases. Meanwhile, a spike in cases prompted a Minnesota school to shift to online learning before Christmas. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-flu-season-schools-hospitalizations/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS News Minnesota reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the state had seen 113 flu-related hospitalizations in 2025, more than double the number recorded last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have expressed concern about this year's flu season. A new subtype of influenza A called H3N2 is spreading quickly. The CDC reported that of 2,086 specimens that tested positive for flu between Dec. 13 and Dec. 20, 2,029 of them had influenza A. When 1,627 of those specimens were subtyped, 1,493, or nearly 92%, were found to be H3N2.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse Bloom, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center who studies viral evolution, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-season-2025-experts-pretty-worried/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;told CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that the virus has changed just enough to make it harder for people's immune systems to recognize the illness. The strain is known for causing tougher flu seasons, especially for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer people have also gotten &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kids-flu-covid-shots-fall-2025-vaccine-guidance-shifts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this year. About 130 million doses of the flu vaccine have been administered nationwide, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, said that while experts are expecting a "H3N2 mismatch," the vaccine's "match to H1N1 and flu B is expected to be good." Meanwhile, early season data from the United Kingdom suggests that the vaccines are still helping prevent severe illness, especially in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting the vaccine is something that people, particularly those who are in high-risk groups, can do," Bloom said.

You’ve probably seen erythritol listed on sodas, protein bars, and even toothpaste. It’s everywhere. Almost zero calories, no sugar spikes, and perfect for keto diets. Sounds like a win, but maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/a&gt; has cracked open a side of erythritol that few expected. It’s not about weight gain or tooth decay. It’s about what this &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweeteners-erythritol-directly-linked-to-heart-attacks-and-strokes/"&gt;sweetener&lt;/a&gt; does to your brain’s blood vessels that may elevate the risk of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study adds to the evidence suggesting that non-nutritive sweeteners that have generally been purported to be safe, may not come without negative health consequences,” said Professor Christopher DeSouza, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-artificial-sweeteners"&gt;Understanding artificial sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners like erythritol have become go-to sugar substitutes for people looking to cut calories or manage blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/erythritol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erythritol&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, is a sugar alcohol found naturally in some fruits but is typically produced in bulk from corn or wheat starch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It tastes sweet like sugar but has almost zero calories and doesn’t spike blood glucose, making it popular among those with diabetes or on keto diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some other sugar alcohols, erythritol usually causes fewer digestive issues because your body absorbs most of it before it reaches the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s not without controversy. Some recent studies, including this one, have raised concerns about potential links between high erythritol levels and cardiovascular issues like heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-changes-brain-cells"&gt;Sweetener changes brain cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did not yet test this in people. They went straight to the cells that line your brain’s blood vessels. These cells regulate blood flow, keep inflammation in check, and help prevent clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells were exposed to erythritol for just three hours. The amount used was equal to what you would get from one sugar-free drink. That was all it took to cause noticeable changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cells got stressed. They flooded with free radicals, also called reactive oxygen species or ROS. These unstable molecules damage proteins, DNA, and cell membranes. In response, antioxidant defenses went up, but not enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was like the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; knew they were under attack and tried, unsuccessfully, to defend themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-vessels-started-misbehaving"&gt;Blood vessels started misbehaving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same short exposure changed how the cells produced nitric oxide, a molecule that helps blood vessels relax. Less nitric oxide means tighter vessels. That’s bad news when your brain needs steady blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total amount of the enzyme that makes nitric oxide didn’t change much, but its function tanked. It stopped doing its job well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol messed with the enzyme’s activation at two specific sites. One turned down, one cranked up. The result was about 20 percent less nitric oxide production. This sets the stage for constricted &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nutritionists-reveal-the-surprising-health-benefits-of-maple-syrup-including-less-belly-fat/"&gt;vessels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweetener-makes-brain-vessels-tighten"&gt;Sweetener makes brain vessels tighten&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same cells started pumping out more &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23139-endothelin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelin-1&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that tells blood vessels to tighten up. Compared to normal cells, the erythritol-exposed ones had a 30 percent increase in ET-1. They also had more of its precursor, Big ET-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a double whammy. First, blood vessels lose their ability to widen. Then, they get signals to squeeze even more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big picture, if your vessels are more constricted and your ability to break down blood clots is lowered, your risk of stroke goes up,” said first author Auburn Berry. “Our research demonstrates not only that, but how erythritol has the potential to increase stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clots-don-t-stand-a-chance"&gt;Clots don’t stand a chance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood clots are tricky. You want your body to stop bleeding when you get a cut. But you also want it to break down unnecessary clots inside vessels. One of the body’s tools for that is tissue-type plasminogen activator, or t-PA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers added thrombin, which mimics a clotting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-sweetener-can-destroy-some-of-the-most-dangerous-bacteria/"&gt;signal&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that should have made the cells release more t-PA. In untreated cells, that’s exactly what happened. A nice 25 percent boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In erythritol-treated cells? Nothing. The response was completely muted. Clots form and cells don’t react. That’s the formula for a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study tracked over 4,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. The research team found that those with high blood levels of erythritol had more strokes and heart attacks within three years. This happened across both sexes and regardless of other health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colorado team didn’t just observe changes. They showed exactly how the sweetener weakens brain vessel cells in ways that match the stroke patterns found in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sweeteners-may-harm-blood-vessels"&gt;Sweeteners may harm blood vessels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeSouza and his team exposed real human brain vessel cells to a typical drink-size dose of erythritol. Many people consume several such servings a day. And unlike some substances, erythritol crosses into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study wasn’t designed to track long-term effects, but it does raise a concern. What happens when those cells face erythritol not just for three hours, but every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the epidemiological study that inspired our work, and now our cellular findings, we believe it would be prudent for people to monitor their consumption of non-nutrient-sweeteners such as this one,” said DeSouza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 22:46:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQcFVsT2JnYXdVMEk2Zk51cFdnVldjQnpla25KZmFLRG9UYzh2VkJVSHZQOFFROUJKcm9TaGluYkFXVnpwbXllUk4xSi1jSDlHWXNKU3JlU2tlRnZyT3hOOEtybVBXSlpJR2ZFYzBTd05PSGxBSlBJYTEybzU4ZkZheHZ5Rk9UVnFqRUNCbnJJSVBUbkE</guid></item><item><title>NC流感病例激增，因为K亚型变异“有效”传播- ABC11</title><link>https://abc11.com/post/nc-flu-cases-surge-subclade-variant-spreads-efficiently/18333909/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;RALEIGH, N.C.

Last week, Cape Fear Valley Health instituted new visitor policies after an increase in respiratory illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Data from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) shows hospitalizations for flu-like illness have increased for nine straight weeks across North Carolina. Updated figures were not publicly released last week because of the Christmas holiday, but are set to be shared Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We're seeing the spike a little earlier than we typically see. It's a pretty sharp spike, quite significant over a short period of time," Ruzek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC lists North Carolina as one of 20 states with "very high" flu-like activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Take flu symptoms seriously. Protect yourself and others and seek care early on if symptoms worsen. If you have symptoms and you are sick, just be cognizant of that and be cognizant of family members or friends that may be more vulnerable to the flu and to those symptoms, such as elderly family members, children and individuals who are immunocompromised (and those who are) pregnant," said Ruzek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc11.com/apps/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Stay on top of breaking news stories with the ABC11 News App&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Even if you are perfectly healthy, we know the flu can still affect you. There are other people in your family, probably who it can really affect, who might be immunocompromised, might be 65 or older, might be less than six months, (or) have a newborn in the family. Those people are going to be a lot harder to protect, and that's why we need to protect not just ourselves, but our loved ones," added Eric Stein, who works with advocacy group Families Fighting Flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Stein's family helped start the nonprofit following the death of Stein's sister Jessica from the flu. At the time of her passing, Jessica was 4 years old, and Eric was 2 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think about what life could have been like with my older sister. It is really sad that I don't really know my older sister like that. I have two younger siblings who never met her. They just hear about her in stories or see pictures of her on the wall," said Stein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors say much of the surge is attributed to a subvariant known as subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"When speaking about the flu shot, it may not be a perfect match for subclade K., but again, it really works where it counts. It decreases hospitalization, death and severe illness," said Widmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Other steps, such as washing hands, wearing a mask, and staying home if you're not feeling well, can help slow the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you are experiencing very severe symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, if you're too weak to walk or to take care of yourself, if you can't hold down food, if you're vomiting uncontrollably, then it's really important to seek emergency medical care," said Widmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I tell everybody, trust your own body. If something's wrong, you know it's wrong, then you're probably right because you know what you're feeling like all the time. Go get tested," Stein added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to a WakeMed spokesperson, there were 1,590 positive flu tests and 81 hospital admissions between Dec. 22 and Dec. 29. During the same time period last year, there were 615 positive flu tests and 34 hospital admissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Across UNC Hospitals, a spokesperson said there were 465 flu cases detected for the week ending Dec. 27, a figure nearly 10 times higher than the number of cases (47) detected for the week ending Dec. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;"It really can affect people our age. I've seen it firsthand, and I know other people personally who have been affected and are now living with serious permanent complications due to the flu that they never even thought was (possible)," Stein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="uvrxY zOGtW "&gt;Copyright © 2025 WTVD-TV.

                There have been at least 7,500,00 illnesses and 3,100 deaths from flu this season, according to CDC data. And flu cases are expected to rise significantly in the coming weeks.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Flu season is off to a rough start this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the virus arrived as expected, cases are rising faster, compared with previous years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last week, more than 19,000 patients with influenza were admitted to hospitals, up about 10,000 from the previous week, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html" target="_blank"&gt;new CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. To date, the CDC estimates at least 7.5 million people have been sickened, and over 3,100 people have died from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The surge seems to be driven primarily by a new strain of the virus — subclade K of influenza A(H3N2) — that emerged in Australia over the summer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Anywhere we detect this virus, you can see a large surge of influenza cases coming afterwards," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1972/andrew-stanley-pekosz" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Pekosz&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In the U.S., "the timing is not that much different from other flu seasons, but the number of cases, and how quickly those cases are increasing is something that is not usually seen this time of year."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New York has been hit especially hard, with state health officials announcing over 71,000 cases last week — the most cases ever recorded in a single week in the state. But other states are seeing high levels of flu activity, particularly in the northeast, midwest and south.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The map is mostly red," says Pekosz, indicating high levels of disease that will likely increase over the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"When you're in the middle of seeing the curve start to go up, we just don't have any sense of where it's going to stop," he says. "That's the big concern in most of the medical communities right now."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What's driving the upswing?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, there's no indication that this new strain is more severe, or even more contagious than previous years, says &lt;a href="https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/krammerlab/dr-krammer/" target="_blank"&gt;Florian Krammer&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there have been changes to the virus that may allow it to get around our immune defenses, he says. "There's less immunity to it, and that's allowing the virus to spread very quickly and extensively."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are some concerns that this season's flu vaccine&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/11/07/g-s1-96655/flu-vaccine-covid-virus" target="_blank"&gt; may not be a perfect match&lt;/a&gt; to the new strain, given it emerged after the formulation was decided last February. "I think we're going to have a mismatch between the strain circulating and the vaccine," says Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at CDC until he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5522036/cdc-rfk-hhs-monarez-jim-oneill-leadership" target="_blank"&gt;resigned in August.&lt;/a&gt; "But the vaccine is still the best protection we have, even if it's imperfect protection."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Preliminary data from the United Kingdom, which saw an early surge of flu this year, suggests the vaccine is about &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade" target="_blank"&gt;30 to 40% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing hospitalization in adults. "Those numbers are in line with what you would typically see," says Krammer, though he stresses those are preliminary estimates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How to respond to the surge&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Flu vaccines only offer protection if people get them and in the U.S., only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;42% of adults&lt;/a&gt; have gotten a flu shot this year. That leaves many people unprotected in face of a likely bad flu season, says Daskalakis. He'd like to see the CDC do more to encourage vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You're not seeing the robust communication that you would expect," he says. "Usually you'd expect to see more alerts coming out of CDC, more recommendations to be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In response to that criticism, a CDC spokesperson said, "the CDC is strongly committed to keeping Americans healthy during flu season. CDC launched a new national outreach campaign designed to raise awareness and empower Americans with the tools they need to stay healthy during the respiratory illness season," adding "the decision to vaccinate is a personal one. People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; In an interview with NPR, Lisa Grohskopf, a medical officer in the CDC's influenza division emphasized the importance of vaccination. "It's definitely not too late to get a flu vaccine if you haven't done it already," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are other ways of protecting yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're using public transportation, if you're in the room with a lot of other people, if you're in a healthcare setting, it's really smart to wear a mask," says Krammer, especially higher-quality masks. "I was taking the subway yesterday in New York City. I was wearing an N95 mask."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Social distancing, especially when you or someone in your household is infected, can help minimize the spread too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you get infected, there are effective treatment options, especially when started with 48 hours of infection. "If you get an infection with influenza, that's really a reason to see a physician, get diagnosed, and then take next steps," says Krammer. "It's not an infection that you should take lightly."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A deadly, drug-resistant fungus is extending its tendrils around the world. Research out this month finds that the public health threat of &lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt; has steadily climbed over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed the scientific literature on &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt;, which was only discovered in 2009. Since then, outbreaks of the fungus have been reported across the globe, including in the U.S. The infection is often mistaken for other germs and is hard to treat with existing drugs, the researchers add, further raising its danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Taken together, these data underscore the need to develop novel antifungal agents with broad-spectrum activity against human fungal pathogens, to improve diagnostic tests, and to develop immune- and vaccine-based adjunct modalities for the treatment of high-risk patients,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mmbr.00187-22"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The rising fungal menace&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fungal infections have become a growing threat to humanity. A study last year, for instance, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/deaths-fungal-infections-deadly-resistant-fungi-climate-1851169272"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that fungi plays a role in killing nearly 4 million people annually, almost double the amount estimated a decade ago. But &lt;em&gt;C. auris—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33091071/"&gt;first discovered&lt;/a&gt; inside a person’s ear by doctors in Japan in 2009—might be one of the scarier fungi around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; can colonize our skin without causing any problems. But sometimes, especially in people with weakened immune systems, it will cause a serious, widespread infection that quickly turns life-threatening. About one-third of people hospitalized with &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; will die from it, research has &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/7/23-0540_article"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;, while the mortality rate for bloodstream infections can reach nearly 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One major reason why &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; is so dangerous is that, compared to other disease-causing &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;species, it’s uniquely adept at resisting many of the most common medications used to treat fungal infections. There have even been recorded cases of pan-resistant &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt;: strains that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35770999/"&gt;resist&lt;/a&gt; all four major classes of antifungals. To make things worse, conventional tests will regularly misidentify &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; as other &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; species, which can then lead to delayed or incorrect treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; is still a relatively rare source of fungal illness, but its global burden has clearly been increasing over time, the study researchers note. It’s now been documented in over 50 countries. In the U.S., &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; infections in hospitals and other healthcare settings have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in at least 39 states, with more than 4,500 cases in 2023 (the last year with available data).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more existentially frightening level, &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; might be one of the first emerging diseases directly caused by climate change, the researchers say. Evidence &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/deadly-super-yeast-found-in-the-wild-for-the-first-time-1846485781"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that the fungus only started regularly sickening humans after it adapted to increasingly warmer temperatures&lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt;the same sort of temperatures found in our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Not all hope is lost&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dire as the outlook might seem, there are still reasons for optimism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that scientists are working on new antifungals, and several promising drugs have recently reached the public or are far along in development. In 2023, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.contagionlive.com/view/fda-approves-antifungal-rezafungin-to-treat-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; Rezafungin for invasive &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; infections. There’s also been some progress on vaccines, some of which could provide protection against a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/gizmodo-science-fair-a-vaccine-to-treat-a-wide-variety-of-fungal-infections-2000648401"&gt;wide range of fungal pathogens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers aren’t just highlighting what we’ve learned so far about &lt;em&gt;C. auris; &lt;/em&gt;they’re hoping to make the discoveries that will help us fend off these dangerous germs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“My laboratory investigates how fungal pathogens interact with the host to drive infection, with the goal of uncovering the molecular mechanisms that enable these organisms to cause disease,” study author Neeraj Chauhan, a professor at the Center for Discovery and Innovation at Hackensack Meridian Health in New Jersey, told Gizmodo. “The long-term goal of research is to guide the development of new strategies for diagnosing, preventing, and treating drug-resistant fungal infections.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any luck, scientists like Chauhan will find the weaknesses of &lt;em&gt;C. auris&lt;/em&gt; long before we end up reenacting &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/last-of-us-fungus-climate-change-health-1850061831"&gt;fungal nightmare scenarios&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking of plopping your infant in front of a screen to get some peace and quiet, you might want to reconsider - higher screen exposure in infancy was linked to longer decision times later on and higher anxiety symptoms in the teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of Singaporean researchers who studied a cohort of 168 children for more than a decade &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(25)00543-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that those exposed to screens in infancy (before two years of age) showed accelerated maturation of brain networks involved in visual processing and cognitive control. That faster specialization, the researchers suggest, was associated with slower decision-making in childhood, and in turn, higher anxiety symptoms in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"During normal development, brain networks gradually become more specialised over time," &lt;a href="https://www.sgpc.gov.sg/detail?url=/media_releases/astar/press_release/P-20251230-2&amp;amp;page=/detail&amp;amp;HomePage=home" rel="nofollow"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the study's lead author Dr. Huang Pei. "However, in children with high screen exposure, the networks controlling vision and cognition specialised faster, before they had developed the efficient connections needed for complex thinking."&lt;/p&gt;

    

&lt;p&gt;The result, Huang said, is limited brain flexibility and mental resilience, leaving children less adaptable later in life, as evidenced by higher anxiety scores in cohort kids who had more screen time before age 2. &lt;/p&gt;

        


        

&lt;p&gt;The researchers, who were mostly associated with Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) Institute for Human Development and Potential, conducted the study to take a closer look at the association between infancy screen exposure, brain development, and behavioral outcomes, which they said has been lacking in prior similar research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who were included in the cohort were selected from the larger Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (&lt;a href="https://gustodatavault.sg/about/gusto" rel="nofollow"&gt;GUSTO&lt;/a&gt;) study, which has been following more than 1,400 mother-child pairs since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

        

&lt;p&gt;Screen exposure in infancy was measured through self-reporting by the children's parents, while MRI scans were taken of children's brains at ages 4.5, 6, and 7.5 to examine physiological changes across the cohort. Children were also given cognitive tests at age 8.5 to measure their decision-making behavior, and were given an anxiety questionnaire at age 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that infant screen time was significantly associated with accelerated maturation of the visual–cognitive control network in the brain. Children showing this faster network maturation also took longer to make decisions in a cognitive task in childhood, and in turn, reported higher anxiety symptoms in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="crosshead"&gt;No one likes an iPad kid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors call their work critical for the future of public health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the paper, infants in the cohort were averaging "more than one to two hours of daily screen time." The World Health Organization, the researchers point out, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2019-to-grow-up-healthy-children-need-to-sit-less-and-play-more" rel="nofollow"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; sedentary screen time is not recommended for 1-year-olds and should be limited to no more than one hour per day for 2-year-olds, with “less is better” still the advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The levels of infant screen use observed in our study cohort are concerning, both in their magnitude and in their clear divergence from WHO recommendations," the team noted in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

        

&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, they estimate that their screen time data, collected between 2010 and 2014, is probably lower than today's average. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our data … precede recent evidence of further increases globally, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic," the team said. "The already elevated levels of screen exposure we observed a decade ago are likely even higher today, making the developmental implications of our findings especially urgent."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same research team also published a &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/screen-time-brain-network-development-and-socioemotional-competence-in-childhood-moderation-of-associations-by-parentchild-reading/D78E5BD54628940B752E35F609BA1FB4" rel="nofollow"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; last year using GUSTO data examining infant screen time in relation to socio-emotional development. Unsurprisingly for any parent who has ever had to separate a child from an iPad, management of emotions was stunted in screen-saturated youngsters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is a new parent to do when confronted with a growing amount of screen time in adults, children, and infants, and multiple research results that suggest it's bad for the brain? Put down the smartphone and stow the iPad in favor of a good, old-fashioned book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children whose parents frequently read to them at age three showed a weakened link between screen time and altered brain development, meaning active engagement and enrichment brought by reading to children and asking them questions about the books shared with them helps foster better emotional management, language skills, and, in the case of the latest study, is likely to help their brains develop at a consistent, healthy rate across various cognitive areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research gives us a biological explanation for why limiting screen time in the first two years is crucial," A*STAR researcher and senior author of the study, Tan Ai Peng, said. "But it also highlights the importance of parental engagement, showing that parent-child activities, like reading together, can make a real difference." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you want a healthy child, turn off the screens and pull out the books. Tech is not a helpful babysitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it's probably a good idea to &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/10/teenagers_ai_chatbot_use/"&gt;keep them away&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/ai_interactions_us_students/"&gt;from AI&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/25/is_ai_contributing_to_mental/"&gt;too&lt;/a&gt;. ®&lt;/p&gt;                                
                    &lt;/div&gt;

                A health worker administers the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to a student in Islamabad, Pakistan on Sept. 24. The vaccine protects against cervical cancer. This year, a new one-dose strategy gained greater acceptance in Pakistan and other countries. Previously, the standard was three doses but years of testing have established that one dose is highly effective for younger girls and older girls can get the benefit from two doses.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Has there been any good news on the global health front in 2025?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The year has been dominated by the unprecedented shakeup of U.S. aid, with the dissolving of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and dramatic cuts and freezes. These changes in the aid budget had a devastating impact on programs that fight disease, provide free health care and focus on maternal and child health. Other countries reset priorities and cut global health funding as well, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The turmoil of this year raises deep concerns about the year ahead, with different perspectives on the impact of the Trump shakeup. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's been a brutal year," says &lt;a href="https://atulgawande.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Atul Gawande, &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;former head of global health at USAID and a professor at Harvard Medical School. "We're now closing in on &lt;a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/USAID-cuts-global-impact-14-million-deaths#:~:text=Key%20takeaways,4.5%20million%20children%20under%205." target="_blank"&gt;700,000 people who are estimated to have died&lt;/a&gt; by any conservative measure as a result of USAID's shutdown. [We now expect] the first increase in in child mortality since the 1960s. It's a setback of staggering proportions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott responded to these characterizations by email, calling them "false conclusions" based on "inaccurate assumption" and pointing to "the groundbreaking global health strategy being implemented at the State Department ... fundamentally changing how the United States delivers assistance by helping governments build stable, self-sustaining health care systems within their own countries."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet amid the debate about the future of global health programs, there was consensus: It was year that saw notable progress. "There have been important successes," says Dr. Kate O'Brien of the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the high points in global health in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A triple crown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;No country has met the goal of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B — until this year. In October, the World Health Organization validated the Maldives for the hepatitis B part of this trifecta. In 2019, the South Asian island nation had been recognized for ending maternal transmission of the other two diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This historic milestone provides hope and inspiration for countries everywhere working towards the same goal," said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2025-maldives-becomes-the-first-country-to-achieve-triple-elimination-of-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv-syphilis-and-hepatitis-b" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; in a statement.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;[Note: Elimination means reducing mother-to-baby transmission below a specific threshold for each disease – for example, an infection rate of less than 1% for hepatitis B Dr. Catharina Boehme of WHO's southeast Asia office, credited the "unwavering commitment toward universal health coverage" to all, "including migrants," as a key element in this achievement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another record-breaking elimination &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just under the wire for a 2025 designation, in mid-December Brazil was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/18-12-2025-who-validates-brazil-for-eliminating-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;validated by WHO for quashing transmission of HIV between mothers and children.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It's the largest country in the Americas to do so.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've been in this work for 25 years and to think how far we've come — I really feel I've been part of witnessing one of the greatest public health achievements of the last 50 years," Anurita Bains tells NPR. The UNICEF associate director for HIV/AIDS, she was in Brazil for the announcement, marked by a celebration whose guests included the country's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progress in the fight to beat malaria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/30-06-2025-suriname-certified-malaria-free-by-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Suriname,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-07-2025-timor-leste-certified-malaria-free-by-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Timor-Leste&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the nation of&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/23-01-2025-georgia-certified-malaria-free-by-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were all certified by WHO as malaria-free in 2025. Suriname gets extra praise as the first country in the Amazon — with its mosquito-friendly forests — to eliminate the disease. The certification means no locally acquired cases of malaria in the certified country for three years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1515/jane-m-carlton" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jane Carlton,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; director of the Malaria Research Institute at Johns Hopkins University, credits much of the malaria success to community health workers dispatched to diagnose and treat foreign workers in Suriname's gold mining areas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are now 47 countries and one territory that are malaria-free. Yet this ancient virus still takes a tremendous toll, with 82 million cases and 610,000 deaths in 2024, and there are concerns of losing progress because of climate change that enables mosquitoes to thrive in new geographic areas, drug resistance and reduced funding for community health workers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But there's encouragement from a new weapon in the arsenal: In 2025, seven countries introduced the recently approved malaria vaccine: Burundi, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia, bringing the total to 24,&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; according to WHO.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A nearly bulletproof anti-HIV drug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lenacapavir, a drug injected twice a year to prevent HIV, was both approved in the U.S.&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2025-who-recommends-injectable-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; and recommended by WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2025. In clinical trials,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7435a1.htm#:~:text=In%20June%202025%2C%20FDA%20approved,follow%2Dup%20of%2052%20weeks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; the drug was 100% effective in preventing HIV in women and 96% effective in men – and there's no issue of stigma as there can be with the daily pills many now take to meet this goal.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/2025/11/driving-global-health-progress-through-american-innovation-and-burden-sharing-the-first-doses-of-lenacapavir-arrive-in-eswatini-and-zambia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In November, &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/2025/11/driving-global-health-progress-through-american-innovation-and-burden-sharing-the-first-doses-of-lenacapavir-arrive-in-eswatini-and-zambia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; a partnership between the U.S. Department of State and the Global Fund&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; began delivering the first shipments of what will be a total of 4 million doses for 2 million people in low- and middle-income countries. Eswatini and Zambia are the two countries to receive doses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Anurita Bains of UNICEF calls lenacapavir "a game changer that is going to be transformative … especially for women who may not want [to tell] or can't tell partners or relatives that they are taking the medication."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was additional good news about lenacapavir in 2025. The U.S. manufacturer Gilead Sciences announced it will allow generic manufacturing of the drug in low- and middle-income countries, with funding from philanthropies including the Gates Foundation, which is a financial supporter of this blog and of NPR, and the Clinton Health Initiative. The generic version is expected to debut in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/news/2025/2025-07-09-global-fund-secures-access-breakthrough-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a statement, the Global Fund&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria said "this marks the first time in history that an HIV prevention product will be introduced in [low- and middle-income countries] at the same time as in high-income countries — a significant milestone for global health equity."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while the road ahead is uncharted for U.S. health aid abroad, Jennifer Kates, senior vice president and director of the Global and Public Health Policy Program at the health research group KFF, told NPR that the 4 million doses of lenacapavir being sent by the U.S. State Department and the Global Fund "is seen as a really important development that the original agreement was made under the Biden administration is now being honored by the Trump Administration." &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting the lead out in Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/en/media/12191/file/MICS%20Preliminary%20findings%202025.pdf.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A government survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh published in 2025 found a likely decline in blood lead levels in children in the country&lt;a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/cautious-signs-progress-lead-exposure-bangladesh-0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; and a definite decline of 10 percentage points among children in the capital Dhaka region.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Lead exposure can come from paints, batteries and dyes like lead chromate sprinkled on turmeric to enhance its color. One in three children in the country are affected; the consequences can include developmental delays and neurologic deficits as well as kidney and cardiovascular problems later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cgdev.org/expert/rachel-bonnifield" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rachel Bonnifield,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; director of the global health policy program at the Center for Global Development points to education efforts by the Bangladeshi government such as warnings about sprinkling lead-based dyes on spices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding for future efforts was affected when funding from USAID, "who had been one of the major proponents, felloff," says Bonnifield, but she is encouraged by new initiatives announced in 2025 by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/public-health/reducing-lead-poisoning/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to support lead prevention projects in Asia, Africa and South America.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A more accessible HPV vaccine protocol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First approved in 2006, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8225515/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been hailed as an effective way to prevent girls from developing cervical cancer. But there's an obstacle to its success: The original regimen called for three doses. That has presented a financial burden to lower-resource countries purchasing the vaccine and a logistical burden for parents who'd have to bring their children in three times — a challenge in parts of the world where clinics are not easily accessible. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2025, however, a new strategy to overcome this issue gained greater acceptance. Years of testing have established that one dose is highly effective for younger girls and older girls can get the benefit from two doses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2025, the one-dose strategy was endorsed by 11 countries: Angola, Benin, Cuba, Djibouti, Ghana, Madagascar, Namibia, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Tunisia. And Belarus, Oman and China added the vaccine at two doses.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"HPV vaccination, which has reached less than 20% of the world, is our biggest opportunity for preventing cervical cancer," says &lt;a href="https://atulgawande.com/about/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Atul Gawande, &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;formerly of USAID. "For every 70 girls who are vaccinated in low-income countries, you will save one life from cervical cancer. It is an extraordinary impact that has now reached 86 million girls and can be advanced considerably."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A six-in-one vaccine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In higher income countries, a hexavalent vaccine, which covers six diseases, has been available for the past 20 years. In July the hexavalent (six disease) vaccine was launched in low-income countries for the first time: Mauritania and Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine protects against diphtheria, hepatitis B, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus, &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; type B and polio. Mauritania and Senegal had previously used a five in one vaccine and separate vaccines for polio. The addition of polio cuts the number of shots kids get – and parents have to get them to. A statement from GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, which is a leader in the effort to get vaccines to kids in lower resource settings, notes that adding one new virus to the vaccine's count can make a significant difference in protecting children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandemic preparedness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In November, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention launched&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/news-item/africa-cdc-launches-agari-a-continent-wide-genomic-data-platform-to-strengthen-outbreak-response/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; Africa Genome Archiving for Response and Insight,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an online platform that will allow researchers across the continent to share genetic data on disease-causing pathogens of concern. They'll be reporting on, including familiar culprits like HIV and malaria as well as newfound threats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Africa developing genomic expertise and capacity will increase the continent's ability to quickly identify, characterize and respond to infectious disease outbreaks," says&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins. That capacity will result in "less damage and disruption" in any future global pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fran Kritz is a health policy reporter based in Washington, D.C., and a regular contributor to NPR.

At 45 years old, after multiple rounds of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and miscarriages, and thinking she was finally “in the clear,” the fetal heartbeat had stopped in the second trimester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of her lament she uttered over and over again: “Why did I wait so long? Why did I wait so long?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ve been a maternal-fetal medicine doctor for more than two decades, and, unfortunately, I’m used to working with patients who are going through these sort of unimaginable losses.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Blend just until the mixture comes together. Overprocessing can make the oils from the nuts release, leading to a greasy texture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To prevent the mixture from clinging to your hands, lightly wet your hands with water as needed before rolling.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a different flavor variation, swap out the lemon juice for Meyer lemon juice or lime juice.&lt;/li&gt;

It can survive on surfaces for long periods of time before spreading to patients through catheters, breathing tubes or IVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some strains of the fungus are considered a superbug because they’re resistant to all types of antibiotics usually used to treat fungal infections.

You’re all on your own,” Melissa Nolan, an assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of South Carolina, told &lt;a href="https://ktla.com/news/nexstar-media-wire/what-makes-candida-auris-so-dangerous/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nexstar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Nexstar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The fungus’ drug resistance has made it especially hard to contain.

Data was missing for two states: Alabama and Florida.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some scientists theorize climate change is contributing to the spread of Candida auris and pathogens like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Historically, fungi have had a hard time surviving at our bodies’ warm body temperature, microbiologist Arturo Casadevall, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/dangerous-fungus-climate-change-new-york-c1b5ab8f4232a5f2320929dae3b80200" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told the Associated Press;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told the Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. But as the climate warms, the fungi are adapting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We have tremendous protection against environmental fungi because of our temperature. However, if the world is getting warmer and the fungi begin to adapt to higher temperatures as well, some … are going to reach what I call the temperature barrier,” where they’ll be able to survive in the human body, Casadevall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/candida-auris-study-reveals-most-132300100.html" data-ylk="slk:Candida auris: Study reveals who is most vulnerable to deadly fungus infection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt; Candida auris: Study reveals who is most vulnerable to deadly fungus infection &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the past, the CDC estimated that “based on information from a limited number of patients, 30–60% of people with C. auris infections have died.

Every year, an estimated &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17703-norovirus" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;684 million&lt;/a&gt; people globally come down with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus is a kind of infectious gastroenteritis, “an inflammation of the bowel and the colon that can cause diarrhea” and vomiting, explains Dr Ambreen Allana, an infectious disease physician based in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus can spread year-round, but has earned the nickname “winter vomiting illness” because it peaks from December to February in the northern hemisphere, says Dr Laraine Washer, medical director of infection prevention and epidemiology at the University of Michigan’s school of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-norovirus-spread" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does norovirus spread?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus is highly contagious. The virus typically enters the gastrointestinal tract via tiny viral particles from an infected person’s saliva or feces. These particles may end up on your hands, or in food or drink, and ultimately in your mouth – “what we call the fecal-oral route”, Washer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Particles remain infectious for up to &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-long-do-norovirus-germs-live-on-household-and-office-surfaces" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;two weeks&lt;/a&gt; on hard surfaces like doorknobs and bathroom fixtures, and it takes very little exposure to make you sick. “The infectious dose of noroviruses is less than 20 virus particles,” says Washer. (Covid-19, by contrast, needs an exposure of &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20503121221115053" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;100-400&lt;/a&gt; virus particles to infect.) “When somebody has an active norovirus infection, there’s billions of virus particles per gram of stool,” says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is also some risk of transmission via aerosolized particles, particularly if you’re around someone while they are experiencing symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norovirus becomes contagious about two days prior to the onset of symptoms, and people can remain contagious for days or even weeks after they’re feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Close quarters such as eldercare facilities, daycares and airports are a “perfect nidus for catching infection”, says Allana. Cruise ships are particularly notorious: the CDC has reported 16 norovirus outbreaks on ships stopping in US ports in 2025 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The onset of norovirus symptoms can feel sudden, starting with abdominal cramping, sweating, chills, nausea, vomiting and “very watery diarrhea”, says Washer. Most cases are “mild” in the medical sense, meaning they resolve within three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nonetheless, it’s an extremely unpleasant illness. “People can feel pretty wiped out, fatigued; they may have a low-grade fever, headache. And in most cases, individuals are not able to continue doing their normal activities,” says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-i-need-medical-care-for-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need medical care for norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Each year, norovirus causes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739528/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;570-800&lt;/a&gt; deaths and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/cid/ciu120" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;70,000&lt;/a&gt; hospitalizations in the US, with people over 65 at greatest risk. Those most likely to have severe norovirus are “children less than five years of age, and especially older individuals and those who are immunocompromised”, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Those in higher-risk age categories are also particularly susceptible to kidney injury due to dehydration from excessive diarrhea, says Allana. If you or a family member is in a higher-risk age category and unable to keep down liquids, Allana recommends seeing your doctor or going to your local emergency department to receive IV fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most adults and older children without underlying conditions recover from norovirus without medical intervention. While the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/outbreak-basics/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; 2,500 norovirus outbreaks annually in the United States, the actual number of infections is closer to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3739528/#:~:text=19%E2%80%9321%20million%20total%20illnesses%20per%20year" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;21m&lt;/a&gt; – most cases go unreported because people can “deal with their infections at home”, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there’s nothing you can do to shorten the duration of a bout of norovirus, it’s important to stay hydrated throughout. “Try drinking the same amount of Gatorade or water as the volume that comes out,” says Allana. “Ice chips, ice lollies – really anything you can keep down that will keep you hydrated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An antiemetic – medication that prevents nausea and vomiting – like Dramamine may be necessary if you can’t keep liquids down. Do not, however, take medicines that stop diarrhea, like Imodium or Pepto-Bismol, says Washer. “Our body is trying to get rid of the infection, and if we keep the viruses inside … they stick around for longer periods of time,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":19,"listId":6039,"identityName":"well-actually","description":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life","name":"Well Actually","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"lifestyle","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-avoid-getting-norovirus" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you avoid getting norovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We don’t have a norovirus vaccine yet. That’s because norovirus is “incredibly difficult” to grow and study in labs, says Dr Andrea Love, an immunologist and microbiologist who has &lt;a href="https://news.immunologic.org/p/its-the-most-violently-ill-time-of" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about norovirus on her Substack. The virus has many different strains, which mutate frequently, making broad protection challenging, Love explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That leaves the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wash your hands: &lt;/strong&gt;“To prevent or control outbreaks, good handwashing is important for everyone,” advises a representative from the CDC via email. “Importantly, infected individuals should not prepare or handle food, or care for others when they are sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hand sanitizer and other alcohol-based disinfectants do not work against norovirus, because of how the virus is structured. “You can use hand sanitizers in addition to handwashing, but hand sanitizer alone does not work well against norovirus and is not a substitute for handwashing,” according to the CDC spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly, with good-quality soap, for at least 20 seconds, says Allana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid using an infected person’s bathroom: &lt;/strong&gt;If possible, designate a separate bathroom for the sick person in your household until they recover, and limit other contact, Washer suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean affected items: &lt;/strong&gt;Clean surfaces with diluted bleach (1 cup per gallon of water) or undiluted 3% hydrogen peroxide, both of which can kill norovirus. Wear disposable gloves when cleaning a bathroom where someone has been sick, and take reasonable precautions when working with strong chemicals, says Washer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When travelling, such as on an airplane, use a paper towel when touching surfaces like the washroom tap and door handle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strong chemical agents are required to kill norovirus, and most disinfecting wipes don’t do the trick. But you may be able to find specialized bleach wipes at medical supply stores.

A similar carefree fluidity prevailed a decade later, as her feet struck hard-packed sand on a shorebreak jog. Twelve-year-old me panted alongside, so desperate to be made in her image that I tolerated heated cheeks and shaking quads. Their trembling barely subsided during the one stop we made, for her to wade into the waves and pee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="disclaimer" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.DisclaimerBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1iz7gbk"&gt;&lt;aside data-testid="affiliate-disclaimer-inline" class="dcr-189ogop"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

Soon, even that wasn’t enough to staunch the flow. She gave up and switched to hiking. “I should have done more Kegels,” she quipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And that’s how I learned – before I’d even taken the SAT – about the repetitive undercarriage squeezing recommended for millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c94b0c70-dfba-4178-929a-a8031f3cdb1a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I tried everything to fix my incontinence.

For context, in 1948 the New York Obstetrical Society &lt;a href="https://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2016/01/fight-women-doctors/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;refused to admit&lt;/a&gt; women, and as late as 1970 &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/health/la-me-male-gynos-20180307-htmlstory.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;only 7%&lt;/a&gt; of gynecologists were female. So it makes sense that a man created “the vaginal manometer” to record the strength of contractions of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32310358" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pelvic floor muscles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They weaken over time as a result of things like surgery, pregnancy, vaginal delivery, smoking, and just plain &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/urinary-incontinence-during-perimenopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ageing while female&lt;/a&gt;. Kegel is credited with first describing how exercising these muscles can&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reduce the type of urinary incontinence that comes with a stressor, like aerobics or jogging on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If only it were as simple as that sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually it was my turn for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). After five pregnancies and three deliveries, coughing while walking would leave me in want of fresh panties. I told my friends I could walk without peeing and I could cough without peeing, but stood no chance against two abdominal stressors at once. “Have you done your Kegels?” they’d ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A few more years ticked by, and after a lap at the track I’d be so wet that it looked like I’d put my pants on over a damp bathing suit. “You’ve been doing Kegels though, right?” a friend texted in response to one of my pandemic-era rants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="16557f31-48fb-4941-88ad-6eebf864dc39" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt; ‘I assumed this was just the price I had to pay for procreating – and for failing to do my Kegels.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: DragonImages/Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Eventually, I started paying about $90 a month to access online videos involving hip lifting and squeezing. I only did it once. By the time I turned 43, I had to wear black leggings on my Sunday morning runs so the dark outline that extended all the way to my knees wouldn’t be so stark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I never mentioned my incontinence at a doctor’s appointment, and no one asked. I assumed this was just the price I had to pay for procreating – and for failing to do my Kegels. I was the one who’d signed up for the course and not done my homework so I didn’t question the narrative of midlife incontinence being a mixture of my fault and my destiny. But what if I should have? What if a catastrophic failure of women’s health and wellness has occurred?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Spoiler alert: I should have, it has, and once I figured that out, a few quick office visits changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="no-more-suffering-in-silence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;No more suffering in silence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The first part of my story, the silent suffering, is hardly unique. About &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/JU.0000000000004009" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;45% to 50%&lt;/a&gt; of women experience SUI at least once a week. Think of it this way: If you make 10 of us skip rope, at least four will later slink off to a bathroom to wrap toilet paper around the crotch of our undies. But not to a doctor’s office, research suggests. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21079556/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;One report&lt;/a&gt; estimates that for every case of incontinence reported to primary care doctors, 20 go unreported. Transgender men on hormone therapy also often experience SUI, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38662108/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; preliminary research. Some cis men struggle with SUI too, usually after treatment for prostate cancer, but &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1097/00005392-200102000-00013" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;many, many fewer&lt;/a&gt; of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For years, I just sucked it up, idiomatically and also literally, with the tissues I carried everywhere. Then one Sunday in February of 2024, something clicked. I’d run a 10K, rather than my usual 5K, on a path way out by the water, too far to make it home to change before &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/04/quaker-parenting-research/682277/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;church&lt;/a&gt;. Tissues it is then. The entryway smelled like urine, but I didn’t think much of it, with all the older folks there to worship. The elevator also reeked. As I moved through more spaces, a terrible realization swept over me. I whispered in my husband’s ear: “Is that odor me?” His widened, almost guilt-ridden eyes were my answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Later that same evening, I sat in bed, showered and fresh. Until I sneezed. After a few moments of disbelief, staring down at my wet pajama shorts, I decided enough was enough. The next morning, I called University of California, San Francisco’s Women’s Center for Bladder and Pelvic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I can’t even do one thing without peeing any more,” I told Dr Michelle Van Kuiken, less than two weeks later. Apparently, I had four main options: (1) pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), which is more than Kegels, but also, is Kegels, (2) the Poise Impressa, a tampon-like contraption you can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34505171/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;insert into your vagina&lt;/a&gt; in order to “gently lift and support the urethra”, according to its promotional materials, (3) bulking agent, sort of like lip fillers, but injected into the tissues of the urethra to make the opening smaller, and (4) the “sling”, a gold-standard surgery that creates a hammock for the urethra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I quickly ruled out PFMT, having written “do Kegels” on my to-do list for the previous seven years and not getting them to-done. The second option seemed silly, given the bedtime incident. Was I supposed to sprint to the bathroom cabinet for an Impressa when I felt a sneeze coming on? The surgery &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9753142/#:~:text=Approximately%202.4%25%20of%20women%20receiving,long%20term%20follow%2Dup%20period" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9169553/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;last me&lt;/a&gt; decades (only about 2.5% of women need a new one after 10 years and less than 20% have re-upped at 15 years), but it would require general anesthesia with its attendant risks, and I wouldn’t be able to exercise for two weeks or have sex for at least four. Exercise is my antidepressant! So is sex!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That left the fillers, what doctors call a “submucosal bulking agent”. Dr Van Kuiken’s staff made a quick call to my insurance company for approval, and told me I could receive the injection the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She warned me that it could end up taking me longer to pee and asked what would bug me more: that delay or leakage? She also offered a heads-up that it would hurt. I figured short-term pain sucks, but after childbirth, I can handle it. And you know what would suck more? Ending up like my grandma, whose bulky adult diapers made a crinkling sound when she sat, yet still weren’t effective enough for her to be comfortable in public. Not wanting that kind of isolation, I decided fillers were worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cadb01ac-6d42-47d4-a4f5-7d0f29dc5c12" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘I decided enough was enough. The next morning, I called UCSF’s Center for Bladder and Pelvic Health.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Catherine McQueen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With my feet in stirrups and a drape spread over my knees, the ghost of pap smears past floated in the air. Starting the same way my IUD insertions had, Dr Van Kuiken first injected lidocaine to numb my urethra and its surrounding tissues. That burned some, like a vaccine, only unfortunately placed. While we waited for it to take effect, she explained that my urethra was sort of like a deflated, doughnut-shaped pool float. By spacing four injections just right, she could plump it up without leaving a low side. Now, those injections? Those hurt quite a bit: Think bee sting plus bikini wax for at least 15 seconds each. Still, when they were done, they were done. The whole thing was no worse than a facial laser treatment like &lt;a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/blog/considering-broadband-light-therapy-heres-what-you-need-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;broadband light therapy&lt;/a&gt;, and I soon walked comfortably home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The next day, I went for a run with the aforementioned baby brother, who’s now 31. Nothing. Not a drop. At the tail end of a jog with one of my teenage daughters a few weeks later, I tried to sprint and felt a familiar dribble. So I went back to Dr Van Kuiken, and four weeks after the initial procedure she injected about 30% more Bulkamid. (It’s not uncommon for women to need a “top-off” injection to achieve results and durability.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I hardly realized I’d come to fear leakage, until all of a sudden I didn’t. I had no idea my gait had changed to try to minimize wetness, until my stride lengthened in the months after the procedures. The way I held my abdomen shifted, as did my times, soon matching my high school best, and then faster. I started running more – and having more fun doing it. It’s been more than a year now, and I’ve completed seven half marathons on trails up and down mountains. Without. A. Drop. And straight to church I can go, with nary a worry or a tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, a quick, safe, minimally invasive, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25730435/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cost-effective&lt;/a&gt; procedure eliminated my incontinence and significantly improved my quality of life. And here’s the kicker: When Dr Van Kuiken did my physical exam, after I’d already chosen fillers, she said: “Your pelvic floor is actually really strong. No amount of Kegels was going to fix this for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6bbb0d75-0152-416e-a9dc-df2fb046fe08" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘A quick, safe, minimally invasive, and cost-effective procedure eliminated my incontinence.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Jay Boncodin/Courtesy of Gail Cornwall&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-dont-more-women-know-about-treatment-options" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why don’t more women know about treatment options?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It took me years to get good care, but more than that, years to even find out a solution existed. It doesn’t have to be this way. As one group of researchers &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33727114/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;summed it up&lt;/a&gt;: “SUI is not part of normal ageing and can be remedied.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But most women don’t know that. One study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24807341/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that less than 15% of those bothered by SUI receive an injection or surgery. Anecdotally, that statistic rings true: every last one of the people I told about my procedures said they had no idea such a thing was possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;You’d think that’s because the FDA only &lt;a href="https://www.bulkamid.com/blog/fda-approves-bulkamid-in-the-united-states-and-is-now-set-for-launch-in-quarter-1-2020/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; Bulkamid in 2020, but bulking agents &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Urogynecology_and_Reconstructive_Pelvic.html?id=sKkTBQAAQBAJ" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were first used&lt;/a&gt; in the 1930s. Innovations in the late 80s made them a more viable option, and now, they can sometimes last 96 months or more for those who are eligible. (Doctors won’t inject bulking agent if, for example, you have an active urinary tract infection.) That can mean eight years of staying dry, or much drier, while belly laughing or lifting a squirmy baby. Most women also don’t know that using synthetic mesh in sling operations starting in 1996 eliminated the need for an abdominal incision and an overnight stay. They don’t know that hormones &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/does-incontinence-get-worse-during-menopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can affect&lt;/a&gt; SUI. We just don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;We believe Kegels are it. As it turns out, Dr Van Kuiken is a big fan of PFMT as a risk-free option. But its efficacy for SUI depends on the cause and severity of the incontinence. What’s more, that acronym encapsulates a lot of different practices, so different that &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1771840&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00404-022-06693-z&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/peeing-after-childbirth-incontinence-sui-solution" data-link-name="in body link" rel="sponsored"&gt;researchers don’t actually know&lt;/a&gt; how effective PFMT is. PFMT with biofeedback, for example, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825641" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has been shown to&lt;/a&gt; work better than without it. In plain English, that means Kegel-like therapies &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8910078/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8910078/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; work&lt;/a&gt; for SUI, but doctors don’t know how often or how well they &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;work, especially since the exercises can be time-consuming. In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19281321/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers asked women to do exercises for &lt;em&gt;45 minutes a day&lt;/em&gt;. I’m not the only one for whom that’s never going to happen. As one friend put it in a text: “They just told me to do kegals which I don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And shame keeps women from learning about other options. Women who do come forward are often told to lose weight or cut out alcohol or sweeteners. Sometimes they’re instructed to drink more water, sometimes less. Sometimes to avoid tea, &lt;a href="https://parentdata.org/urinary-incontinence-during-perimenopause/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;but maybe&lt;/a&gt; add in decaffeinated coffee. Each of these “behavioral and lifestyle” recommendations can be read to imply that a woman is suffering because she’s been lazy or made bad decisions about what she puts in her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That feels gendered. When men have a quality-of-life issue, we try to fix it. (Hello, Viagra.) When women have a problem, we tell them they wouldn’t if they’d just been a bit better and tried a bit harder, and also, to just deal.

Researchers found that men with the disorder primarily exhibit deficits in specific stress-regulating lipids, whereas women exhibit heightened signs of systemic inflammation. These results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2025.111501" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Progress in Neuropsychopharmacology &amp;amp; Biological Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is a psychiatric condition that develops in some individuals following exposure to severe or life-threatening events. It is well established that the disorder does not affect the population uniformly. Women are diagnosed with the condition at nearly twice the rate of men. Women also tend to suffer from longer-lasting symptoms and have higher rates of co-occurring health issues, such as autoimmune diseases. Despite these clear disparities, the biological reasons for this gender gap have remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical researchers have historically focused on two specific internal networks when studying the effects of trauma. The first is the endocannabinoid system. This network functions as a physiological buffer against stress. It utilizes lipid-based messengers to help the brain process fear, regulate emotional behavior, and return the body to a state of calm after a threat has passed. When this system is working correctly, it aids in the extinction of fear memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second network of interest is the immune system. In times of acute stress or injury, the body releases inflammatory proteins known as cytokines. While this is a protective measure in the short term, chronic inflammation can become maladaptive. Sustained immune activation is known to negatively influence brain circuits that regulate mood and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most prior investigations into the biology of trauma have studied these two systems in isolation. Many older studies also combined data from male and female participants, which can obscure sex-specific patterns. To address these gaps, a team led by Primavera A. Spagnolo at the Department of Psychiatry, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School designed a study to analyze both systems simultaneously. The researchers aimed to determine if the molecular fingerprints of the disorder differ based on biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team utilized data and samples from the Mass General Brigham Biobank. They retrospectively selected a cohort of 173 individuals for analysis. This group was engineered to be balanced, consisting of 90 men and 83 women. Approximately half of the participants had a confirmed medical diagnosis of PTSD. The other half served as a healthy control group with no history of psychiatric illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators analyzed serum samples to measure the circulating concentrations of key molecules. To assess the stress-buffering system, they measured levels of endocannabinoids. These included anandamide, a molecule essential for mood regulation, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. They also measured related lipids like oleoylethanolamide and arachidonic acid. To assess immune status, the team quantified levels of several pro-inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and various interleukins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed distinct molecular profiles that varied significantly by sex. Men diagnosed with PTSD showed a marked depletion of endocannabinoids compared to healthy men. Specifically, they had lower levels of anandamide, arachidonic acid, and oleoylethanolamide. This suggests that in males, the pathophysiology of the disorder is linked to a breakdown in the body’s natural ability to chemically buffer stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male patients did not exhibit widespread immune dysregulation. When compared to the healthy male control group, the men with PTSD showed normal levels for most inflammatory markers. The only exception was tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which was elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A completely different biological picture emerged among the female participants. Women with PTSD did not show the depletion of anandamide or arachidonic acid seen in the male group. Their endocannabinoid levels remained largely comparable to healthy women. In fact, one lipid called 2-arachidonoylglycerol was found at slightly higher levels in the female patient group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of a lipid deficit, the female patients displayed a profile characterized by overactive inflammation. Women with the disorder had significantly higher concentrations of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 compared to healthy women. They also showed elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This indicates that for women, the disorder is more closely associated with a persistent state of immune activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers performed additional statistical checks to ensure the robustness of these findings. They accounted for a common genetic variation in the FAAH gene. This gene produces an enzyme responsible for breaking down anandamide. Even after controlling for participants’ genotypes, the sex-based divergence remained clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined a subgroup of patients who suffered from major depressive disorder alongside their PTSD. Depression is a common comorbidity that shares many biological features with trauma disorders. The study found that the sex-specific patterns held true in this subgroup as well. Men with both conditions showed low endocannabinoids, while women with both conditions showed high inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings offer a potential explanation for why certain experimental treatments for PTSD have failed in the past. Several clinical trials have tested drugs designed to boost endocannabinoid levels by inhibiting the enzyme that destroys them. These trials have largely been unsuccessful. Spagnolo and her colleagues note that these trials often enrolled a majority of female participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If women with PTSD do not suffer from a deficit of endocannabinoids, treatments aimed at replenishing them would likely be ineffective. Conversely, such treatments might be highly beneficial for men, who show a clear deficiency. This study suggests that future therapeutic approaches must be tailored to the sex of the patient. Treatments for women might need to focus on dampening the inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are limitations to this study that contextualize the results. The researchers used a retrospective design based on electronic health records. They did not conduct real-time clinical interviews to assess the current severity of symptoms. They also lacked data on the timing of the original trauma or childhood adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study did not measure levels of sex hormones like estradiol at the time of blood collection. Estradiol is known to influence both the immune system and endocannabinoid signaling. Spagnolo and her team hypothesize that hormonal fluctuations may play a role in the “multiple-hit” mechanism that makes women more vulnerable to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors recommend that future research should track these biological markers prospectively. They suggest utilizing stress-provoking experimental tasks to see how these systems react in real time. Confirming these distinct pathways could pave the way for precision medicine in psychiatry. The study highlights the necessity of moving beyond a “one size fits all” approach to mental health treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2025.111501" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sex differences in endocannabinoid and inflammatory markers associated with posttraumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Therese A.

                &lt;p&gt;2025 has proven to be a nightmare year for measles, with the U.S. reaching a toll not seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the latest data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been more than 2,000 recorded cases of measles this year. Most of these infections are occurring among the unvaccinated and  children. Several outbreaks are still ongoing, and the U.S. is likely to lose its official measles-free status as early as next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A record-setting year&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 23, there have been 2,012 confirmed measles cases in the U.S., the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tally is the highest seen since measles was locally eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, surpassing the previous modern high of 1,274 cases in 2019; it’s also the most since 1992, which saw over 2,000 cases. However, experts have said that these current numbers are almost certainly an underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The largest outbreak began in early January along parts of Western Texas. But measles has spread far and wide across the U.S. this year, with cases seen in 43 states, along with 50 separate outbreaks. About two-thirds of reported cases have occurred among children under the age of 18, and 93% involved people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Three people in the U.S. have died from measles this year, while 227 have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The official return of measles&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the Texas outbreak formally ended in August, there is concern that some current outbreaks are genetically linked to it. If that’s true, then we will soon pass the one-year mark of measles circulating locally in the country. And once that happens, the World Health Organization is expected to declare that measles has officially returned to the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The U.S. would hardly be alone in welcoming measles back. In November, Canada &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;similarly lost&lt;/a&gt; its measles elimination status. The viral disease has &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/european-region-reports-highest-number-measles-cases-more-25-years-unicef-whoeurope" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;also resurged&lt;/a&gt; in many parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The return of measles has been fueled by waning vaccination rates. It’s a problem that precedes the installment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,—a long time enemy of vaccines—as head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. But Kennedy hasn’t &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-worst-ways-rfk-jr-has-harmed-public-health-this-year-2000698509" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;helped&lt;/a&gt; the situation, either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the past year, for instance, RFK Jr. and his allies have restricted people’s access to certain vaccines. He’s also reduced the workforce of the CDC and other health agencies, as well as personally fired senior officials who refused to back his anti-vaccine policies. And during the Texas measles outbreak, he recommended unsupported treatments like cod liver oil that may have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vitamin-a-fix-for-measles-is-hurting-kids-in-texas-2000585347" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;further endangered&lt;/a&gt; some children. Next year, he may even succeed at &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-tried-to-wreck-the-childhood-vaccine-schedule-over-the-weekend-2000702477" target="_blank" rel="false noopener"&gt;dramatically shortening&lt;/a&gt; the childhood vaccination schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The one positive silver lining is that the overall vaccination rate for measles (above 90%) is still high in the U.S., at least for now. But it has been declining lately and it’s not high enough to ensure herd immunity for people unable to get vaccinated, such as very young children (the first measles shot, of three, isn’t typically given until age one). So while most Americans will remain protected against measles, it could continue to cause widespread outbreaks in vulnerable regions for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2025 has been a bad year for measles, but the worst may yet be to come.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

This fascination with centenarians, or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-live-to-100-8734564" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;those who live to 100&lt;/a&gt; years of age or more, has yielded entire research groups dedicated to learning about this demographic. From their research, they’ve teased out lifestyle similarities across these unique individuals, from food choices, social practices, and general attitudes and outlooks on life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We’ve spoken to a handful of experts on the topic to better understand the common practices of those in this illustrious group—particularly when it comes to what they eat. Read on to discover some of the top diet staples for those who live for a century or more.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-healthy-habits-of-centenarians"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Healthy Habits of Centenarians &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Centenarians live all over the world, but some places have better recordkeeping than others – and those places often have more documented centenarians. This is one cause of the ‘Blue Zone' phenomenon,” says Ben Meyers, the founder of LongeviQuest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dan Buettner was the founder of the trademarked Blue Zones concept that identifies places where groups of centenarians are concentrated. These areas are found all across the globe, on nearly every continent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“However, some more well known Blue Zone locations include rural areas such as Okinawa, Japan, Ikaria, Greece, Sardinia, Italy, and Loma Linda, USA,” says Bradley J. Willcox MSc, MD, FGSA, FRSM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And when it comes to lifestyle, quite a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-live-to-100-8734564" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;few commonalities&lt;/a&gt; have been discovered amongst those living in these areas. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/stress-relieving-foods-7643866" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Avoiding stress&lt;/a&gt; in everyday life is one philosophy that many centenarians practice. “We’ve found that centenarians focus on their lives and the lives of the people they love, instead of problems beyond their control,” Meyers says. &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In a similar vein, Blue Zoners tend to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/emotional-health/10-ways-happier" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;find joy&lt;/a&gt; in everyday life. “The concept of suffering for 50 weeks to splurge on a two-week vacation would bewilder a centenarian,” Meyers adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Maintaining a positive attitude as well as “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/workouts/how-to-start-working-out" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;exercising&lt;/a&gt;, having a strong sense of community, and avoiding smoking are other key factors to improving longevity,” says Amy Davis, RDN.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-foods-centenarians-eat-often"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 8 Foods Centenarians Eat Often &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what may fascinate people most about these long-lived individuals are the foods they eat and the habits they have around eating. “Some eating patterns seen in centenarians include eating a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/easy-healthy-breakfast-ideas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;large breakfast&lt;/a&gt;, eating mostly &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-plant-based-foods-nutrition-experts-always-recommend-11680448" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt;, avoiding weight-loss diets, moderating &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-alcohol-to-drink-8391763" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, and reserving sweets for celebrations,” says Davis. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With these practices in mind, here are eight foods researchers have identified as diet staples for centenarians:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Legumes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “One of the top foods amongst centenarians is legumes, which are rich in &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and provide plant-based protein,” Davis explains. “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; are thought to help control cholesterol and blood sugar, as well as lower the risk of chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease.” Legumes encompass beans, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/health-benefits-of-peas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;peas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/lentil-salad-recipe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;lentils&lt;/a&gt;. So, regardless of whether you typically reach for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/ways-to-use-chickpeas-meal-prep" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, black beans, red lentils, snap peas, or otherwise, all of them will help promote longevity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another common ingredient found in the kitchens of those living to (or well-past) 100 is olive oil. This culinary staple is high in healthy unsaturated fats that support optimal cholesterol levels. It’s also rich in micronutrients like plant compounds, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamins/vitamin-e-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-k-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; that serve as antioxidants to lower inflammation throughout the body, further decreasing chronic disease risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Nuts and Seeds &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nuts, which are full of vitamins, minerals, and unsaturated fats, are also staples in centenarians' diets,” says Davis, “Nuts are associated with reduced risk for heart disease and inflammation, likely due to their rich &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19192028/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt; content.” Given that &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/these-are-the-10-best-nut-and-seed-butters-for-a-protein-boost" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt; have a similar nutritional composition to nuts, they also elicit similar longevity benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Tea &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s green, black, herbal, caffeinated, or decaf, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-tea-to-drink-daily-8608683" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt; is one of the top beverages among Blue Zoners. This is likely thanks to the multitude of antioxidant-rich plant compounds it contains. In fact, tea consumption has been shown to support immune, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24972454/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-for-gut-health-8762795" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;gut&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34784347/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30585192/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;metabolic&lt;/a&gt; health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Seafood &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Researchers have also found that centenarians eat smaller amounts of meat and tend to include more &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/heathy-fish-shrimp-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and other lean seafood in their diets,” says Davis. This may be due to the fact that many Blue Zones are located near the ocean. However, certain types of seafood (like fatty fish) serve as some of the few naturally concentrated sources of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which are potent anti-inflammatory agents that encourage optimal immune, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9641984/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;, and heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Whole Wheat Sourdough Bread &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whole wheat sourdough bread combines a few common food trends seen across centenarians. “&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/healthiest-grains" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whole grains&lt;/a&gt; are another common denominator of centenarians. They are rich in fiber, minerals, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, especially when compared to their white, refined counterparts,” explains Davis, “Eating whole grains is associated with a lower mortality risk from cardiovascular disease and cancer.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Many centenarians are known for their high energy levels. Starchy foods may help centenarians stay active until very late in life,” Meyers adds.&lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/2020/07/blue-zones-diet-food-secrets-of-the-worlds-longest-lived-people/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Researchers also discovered&lt;/a&gt; that many people living to 100 or longer bake their own bread—a lot of times using &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/preparation/sourdough-starter" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;sourdough starter&lt;/a&gt;. This living culture of bacteria sparks fermentation in bread dough, helping to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5302394/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;digest some of the gluten&lt;/a&gt; it contains and increasing the digestibility of the final product. Sourdough bread also tends to have a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8000543/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;lower glycemic index&lt;/a&gt; than other loaves, supporting blood sugar management and metabolic health.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Sweet Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you watched the Netflix documentary, then you may remember the Japanese purple sweet potatoes that served as a staple food for Okinawan centenarians. And while this specific variety of potato may be tricky to track down in the States, your everyday &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/sweet-potato-nutrition" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sweet potato&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/american-consumers-new-favorite-supermarket-chain-8559639" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;grocery store&lt;/a&gt; is pretty similar nutritionally. Both types of sweet potato are rich in fiber and micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-high-in-potassium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-a-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/vitamin-c-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, and plant compounds. These help to improve immune, heart, and metabolic health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Turmeric &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And finally, certain nutrient-dense spices, like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health-benefits-of-turmeric-8633964" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, can also promote longevity. “Turmeric is rich in phytonutrients, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/flavonoid-rich-foods-8787107" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;such as flavonoids&lt;/a&gt;, that may be beneficial to living longer,” says Willcox. The phytonutrients (another name for plant compounds) found in turmeric, like curcumin, work to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/signs-of-inflammation-7565179" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; throughout the body, supporting overall health as well as targeted areas, like the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1064748117305110?via%3Dihub" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

If their new model turns out to be right, the scientists behind it suggest it could explain why these conditions affect so many systems in the body, and could help inform the search for long-awaited treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) is a historically misunderstood and stigmatized chronic condition. As the name suggests, one of the key symptoms is severe fatigue, but patients experience &lt;a href="https://meassociation.org.uk/me-cfs-symptoms-diagnosis/" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; affecting a whole range of organs and systems, from pain, to temperature and light sensitivity, to brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different degrees of severity and no known cure, and there’s been a lot of &lt;a href="https://impact.ed.ac.uk/opinion/me-origins-of-a-modern-medical-scandal/" target="_blank"&gt;debate and controversy&lt;/a&gt; in recent years around treatment approaches. There has also been landmark research to attempt to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/8-key-dna-regions-more-likely-to-be-altered-in-people-with-mecfs-finds-27000-strong-study-80341" target="_blank"&gt;identify the causes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-blood-test-offers-potential-for-simple-accurate-mecfs-diagnosis-researchers-claim-other-experts-arent-so-sure-81088" target="_blank"&gt;develop a reliable test&lt;/a&gt; for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One trigger that has been recognized is &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-is-just-like-other-post-viral-syndromes-health-chief-argues-73403" target="_blank"&gt;viral infection&lt;/a&gt;. Though not all patients can trace the onset of their symptoms back to a viral illness, in many cases it’s thought that infection with a virus such as &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-the-epstein-barr-virus-causes-multiple-sclerosis-and-where-science-is-on-a-cure-78701" target="_blank"&gt;Epstein-Barr&lt;/a&gt; sparks the development or worsening of ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This conviction was only strengthened when COVID-19 came on the scene. Back in 2020, some of the earliest COVID patients were &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-patients-say-they-still-struggle-to-convince-medics-their-illness-is-real-78584" target="_blank"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; that they had recovered from their initial illness, only to be struck down by a constellation of symptoms that would go on to persist for months or even years. This was what came to be known as long COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study identified a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/people-whove-had-covid-could-be-almost-8-times-as-likely-to-develop-mecfs-77612" target="_blank"&gt;strong link between ME/CFS and long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, and there is substantial symptom overlap between the two conditions. As understanding of long COVID has increased and research into its causes and potential treatments has ramped up, many in the ME/CFS community have expressed hope that this could have a knock-on positive impact on research into ME/CFS as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qr-Ayt1Ne24?&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new paper from scientists mainly based at Renegade Research in Denver, Colorado is forming part of the effort to figure out the underlying basis of some of the overlapping symptoms. According to the team’s modeling, damage to the brainstem could be the key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In vulnerable individuals,” they write, “an infection may damage the connective tissue structures responsible for maintaining the physical integrity of the brainstem. This can lead to neuromechanical pathologies such as craniocervical instability (CCI) and intracranial pressure dysregulation that cause mechanical deformation or displacement of the brainstem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, they say, could impact the immune system, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/why-is-the-vagus-nerve-so-important-70392" target="_blank"&gt;autonomic nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, and metabolism, explaining the multi-system nature of these conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They go on to outline a seven-step pathological process beginning with the initial infection and immune response. In some cases, they believe that the immune system could go too far and cause excess damage to the tissues in the brainstem that maintain its structure, and if this does not heal it could eventually lead to chronic brain inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the brainstem is a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/a-woman-born-missing-most-of-her-brain-just-celebrated-her-20th-birthday-what-does-that-mean-81573" target="_blank"&gt;major control center&lt;/a&gt; for a lot of vital functions, the longer this goes on, the more chance of downstream effects like re-activation of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-the-cold-sore-virus-that-you-probably-have-silently-invades-the-human-brain-76636" target="_blank"&gt;dormant viruses&lt;/a&gt;, immune dysregulation, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting hypothesis, one that the authors say fills in some of the gaps in other theories of how ME/CFS develops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there can be individual variability in the presentation of ME/CFS, the core diagnostic features involve processes that are regulated by the brainstem. These features are present in all people with the diagnosis,” they write. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point to previous &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/covid-19-damages-a-major-brain-control-center-ultra-powerful-mri-scans-reveal-76273" target="_blank"&gt;brain imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; in patient populations that have identified brainstem abnormalities in both long COVID and ME/CFS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the authors of the paper is also offered as a case study – he claims that his own severe ME went into remission after surgery to correct a CCI. While the team accepts that anecdotal evidence like this can’t necessarily be applied more broadly to other patients, they propose that it could offer a basis for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This model can be tested at each step of the causal chain. It has interdisciplinary relevance and can be explored and tested by many different fields of research,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our hope is to inspire new research and treatments for patients suffering from a neglected and debilitating disease that has long been considered a mystery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987725002518" target="_blank"&gt;Medical Hypotheses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:05:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNdzFRUnZrWmZyUUcwaUFRdmxTNkVjY3RVMGdVODVHVDlmS1ZWVnIwSkxRWDZOaVpNaWhRTFN1REtMbzh3bTg5ZmRpTnB3cjlzOVlPRGF5Z1NSRDk3YlFJVWduVjlwbHFfYWJ1ZE1WSDJZQ0h5aVg2cE83b2doclZKdDVkLVloSklrRDJCZHAycEpoS2d0czg3ZXdpOFJpUF9KajA0aFZLNVJTc0JXT2o2NkYybFYzbmc</guid></item><item><title>完美的午餐休息时间：如何远离办公桌–并抓住这一天-卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/30/perfect-lunch-break-away-from-desk-seize-the-day</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;M&lt;/span&gt;y quest for the ideal lunch break is definitely a triumph of hope over experience. From inventing endless super-soups that might banish the mid-afternoon snack attack, to wildly optimistic lunchtime to-do lists, I have tried and failed countless times. The executive coach &lt;a href="https://www.zoethompson.uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Zoe Thomson&lt;/a&gt; is not surprised. “One of the biggest things for people is they overestimate how much time and energy they are going to have in their lunch hour,” says Thomson, who previously had a 20-year career with the Avon and Somerset police. “And they underestimate how much time and energy they might need to achieve it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I tell her that this has been the flaw with most of my doomed lunchtime masterplans. “The problem is, unpredictable things happen. Say you plan to do a 45-minute spin class in a 60-minute lunch break, but your last call overruns by 10 minutes. Your plan is no longer feasible. If you decided instead to do a 10-minute walk around the block every day, and then have a nice cup of tea after your sandwich, you’re winning. Even if something urgent comes up, the 10-minute walk is still possible. And on a really good day you could walk four times around the block.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I confess that I find this idea a bit uninspiring. How am I going to transform my lung capacity by ambling to the end of the road? “Actually, when you look at the most successful people, they do the boring, small, incremental changes daily and stick with it,” says Thomson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3db36540-0d4e-4fe1-a74a-c1faf749c53f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Try to fit in a 10-minute walk every day.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Posed by models; JohnnyGreig/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But even if you’re ensconced in a healthy routine, there can still be space to mix it up. “As humans, we like certainty, but we crave variety,” she says. And after a morning of work, she points out, many of us struggle with decision fatigue. “So if we aim for 80% routine and 20% variety, that’s probably about right. Having to make a fresh decision about what to do for lunch every day creates stress,” says Thomson. Having occasional lunch breaks with a shared activity can be great – a book group works well, as does an uplifting choir session such as those organised by &lt;a href="https://www.musicinoffices.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Music in Offices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://selinabarker.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Selina Barker&lt;/a&gt; is a coach and creator of &lt;a href="https://projectyoujournals.com/time-to-thrive-journal" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Time to Thrive&lt;/a&gt;, a journal that focuses on energy management rather than time. “However long your lunch break lasts, even if it’s only 10 minutes, the key point is that it’s there to top your energy back up. The prescription for how you do this will vary depending on the type of work you do. So if you’ve been in meetings all morning with people talking at you, maybe what you need is a quiet walk in the park – especially for introverts working in an open-plan office. But if you’ve been on your feet for hours, maybe the best thing would be a yoga or meditation class.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you work in an office, it can sometimes feel a bit awkward to step away from the canteen crowd and go off on your own. Barker says we shouldn’t feel embarrassed about prioritising what we actually need. “Don’t make a big thing of it. Just say I’m off to recharge my batteries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When it comes to the main event – the food – choosing what to eat can be tricky. Ideally, we want something that is enticing, yet still healthy and will sustain our energy until home time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="da6f0c49-2948-4fdb-bbbe-2c54fd46571f" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Add wholegrains to ensure your salad is filling enough.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: d3sign/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The lunches that work against you are usually the highly refined ones,” says the nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.rosemarynutrition.co.uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Rosemary Martin&lt;/a&gt;. “A pastry or white-bread sandwich with crisps or a chocolate bar on the side gives you a quick boost followed by a predictable drop in energy and concentration.” But not all lunches labelled healthy are good either. “The tiny low-carb salad may feel virtuous at midday but leaves you tired, distracted and craving sugar a couple of hours later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:6060,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;how-to-have-a-better-day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Sign up to our 16-part series and get expert advice on how to improve your life - from morning to night&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;How to have a better day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Twice weekly, for eight weeks&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;You're signed up to How to have a better day.&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;features&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Martin suggests that if you want steady energy and clear focus after lunch, the magic ingredient is balance. “Go for meals that combine whole grains, plant protein, healthy fats and colourful vegetables that will digest at a comfortable pace and give your brain what it needs to stay focused into the afternoon. Lentil soup with wholegrain bread, a tofu, rice and veg bowl or a hummus wrap with plenty of crunchy salad are simple but nourishing options which will reliably carry you through the rest of your day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For those who work at home, all of this becomes a lot easier. You can exercise at home and prepare lunch far from the horrors of the office microwave. But experts point out that there are still important issues to be mindful of. A common strategy is skipping the lunch break altogether in order to finish early. “I do often question it when people tell me they’re saving that hour for the end of the day. I think that takes away from what the lunch break is actually for,” says Thomson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, she agrees that for some people, taking an entire hour might not make sense. “You could split the hour into three 20-minute breaks spread across the afternoon or two half-hour ones,” she says, but the principles remain the same. Are you stepping away from your desk? “Are you taking time to get up and move (or sit down and rest if you’re on your feet all day?) Are you giving yourself some downtime? If you don’t create that space to slow down the brain, it will wake you up at three or four in the morning.” It’s much better, she says, “to give yourself headspace by design.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNdDU2Tm0yVkJ3OGN6UWRsZE9mZmFBWXVNbk43S0NCQ3ZoSERoOWltUWdFTDBzZXVqV1VPVF8wWHl1dk1KOGpIYTJNYkpFaGpCbjI2bDNrczE5THNBOXdYWjcyUnF6R0tJMTVCYVdyY011dzhRYXQ2R1BTTFZ4WUN4bHJKV0dQMmcyd1VoeklaS2tVbENidktUV1QzN19KZWV6a1Bn</guid></item></channel></rss>
