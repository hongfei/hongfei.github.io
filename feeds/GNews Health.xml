                Escherichia coli or E. coli is a part of family of bacteria that are commonly found in the human gut. Scientists found that a toxin the bacteria release is linked to some cases of colorectal cancer.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear why colon cancer cases &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;have doubled&lt;/a&gt; in people under 55 over the past two decades, a staggering rise that has alarmed doctors and cancer researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But part of the story could be colibactin, a toxin made by certain strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; and other bacteria. In a study out this week, researchers have identified a strong link between this DNA-damaging toxin and colon cancer among younger patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team, based at the University of California, San Diego, analyzed tissue samples from close to 1,000 colorectal cancer patients across four continents. They found the majority had cancers bearing mutations that signaled a past encounter with colibactin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You can think of it as the weapon system of a bacteria to fight other bacteria and to defend themselves," says &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Ludmil+Alexandrov&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank"&gt;Ludmil Alexandrov&lt;/a&gt;, the lead author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" target="_blank"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; this week.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Strikingly, those under the age of 40 with early-onset colon cancer were three to five times more likely to have these mutations than those in their 70s and older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The thinking goes that in some people, this bacterial weaponry — technically called a "genotoxin" — can get directed at their gut cells, seeding mutations that put them at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to their data, this exposure isn't ongoing when the cancer is diagnosed. Instead, it appears to have happened during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Our estimate is that it happens within the first 10 years of life," Alexandrov says. "So if you get that mutation at age 5, that puts you 20 to 30 years ahead of schedule for getting colorectal cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the study shows a strong association, the data can't prove colibactin &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; these patients to develop cancer at a younger age. And researchers in the field don't expect &lt;em&gt;E. coli,&lt;/em&gt; or any single microbe for that matter, to be the skeleton key for the surge in colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"That would be too simple,"&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;says &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=Christian+Jobin%2C&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank"&gt;Christian Jobin&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiome researcher at the University of Florida.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More likely, he says, colibactin — studied closely in &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;but produced by other bacteria, too &lt;em&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;is one "hit" among many to our microbiome, which together may place some people on a faster trajectory for developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What triggers a DNA-damaging toxin&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study is a new clue into the rise in colorectal cancer in the young. Scientists believe some confluence of environmental factors, including diet, a sedentary lifestyle, medication and so on, is driving this steep rise. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These could be having downstream effects on the microbes in our gut like &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been really perplexing," says &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/faculty-lab-directory/dey-neelendu.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Neelendu Dey&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist whose lab focuses on the gut microbiome at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. "The microbes that may contribute to cancer risk are tricky to understand."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The family of microbes to which &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; belongs is actually the most prevalent type of bacteria in your gut during the very early stages of life. In other words, it's not some new infectious agent that needs to be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;About 20% to 30% of people have strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that can synthesize this toxin, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily having "deleterious effects," says Jobin, whose lab has pioneered related research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adding to the puzzle: Not everyone with colorectal cancer has these signatures of colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's something provoking the bacteria to behave this way, perhaps giving it an advantage to grow in more abundance. "What triggers this weapon or the deployment?" Jobin says. "We don't know but we have to consider the environment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that some of these &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; that produce colibactin are influenced by diet, inflammation, and medication," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Jobin says the new research is "fantastic" because it bridges early preclinical research in animals with "real life humans," and opens new avenues for research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Studies conducted on animals have shown colibactin exposure can drive cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, deleting the genetic region responsible for producing this toxin in &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; can actually incapacitate the bacteria from promoting cancer in animals. Feeding the animals more or less fiber can affect tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Antibiotics use and nutrition, could be at play&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because they sequenced the genome of cancer from patients all over the globe, Alexandrov says the researchers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;could tell these mutations related to colibactin are actually quite rare in more "rural, non-industrialized" regions of Africa and Asia, whereas they turn up more frequently in the U.S. and Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;That evidence, coupled with the findings that it's a result of early childhood exposure, gives them a handful of hypotheses about what could be at play.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says some of their top suspects are the mode of birth (cesarean section vs. vaginal delivery), breastfeeding, the use of antibiotics and nutrition, for example whether children were &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;fed ultra processed foods.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;All of these factors are known to substantially affect the microbiome and there is some evidence they may impact this [colibactin producing] bacteria, but we really need to investigate each one carefully."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dey views all of these as plausible, particularly antibiotics, given that other research teams &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37504220/" target="_blank"&gt;have linked early-life antibiotic use&lt;/a&gt; to increased risk of colorectal cancer later on.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More broadly, he says he hopes researchers can eventually find microbes that serve as "biomarkers" for identifying people at risk of developing pre-cancers. And, perhaps down the line, drugs can be designed to target toxins like colibactin to counter their harmful effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Of course, it sounds simple, but we have to acknowledge the ecological lessons learned in other contexts," he says. "When you try to take out, or introduce a species, it can have effects that you didn't anticipate, so this all needs to be done very thoughtfully."&lt;/p&gt;

Getting quality sleep — the kind that leaves you feeling refreshed and ready for the day — is critical for a healthy brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;People with disturbed sleep, like insomnia or sleep apnea, have a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079217300114" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/well/mind/sleep-dementia.html" title=""&gt;developing dementia&lt;/a&gt; than those with no sleep issues. Poor sleep can harm your brain in other ways, too. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000208056" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that people in their 30s and 40s with heavily disrupted sleep (such as frequent awakenings or movements) were two to three times more likely to test lower in executive function, working memory and processing speeds a decade or so later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists think that deep sleep and rapid eye movement (or REM) sleep are particularly influential when it comes to brain health and dementia risk. A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40110600/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study published last month&lt;/a&gt; on people with deep sleep and REM deficiencies found that the subjects’ brains showed signs of atrophy in M.R.I. scans 13 to 17 years after the deficiencies were observed; the atrophy looked similar to what you’d find in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-537baae6"&gt;What Scientists Know So Far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When you’re asleep, your brain continuously cycles through four distinct phases: Two stages of lighter sleep, when your body relaxes and your heart rate and temperature drop; deep sleep or slow wave sleep, when brain activity slows; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/25/well/mind/rem-sleep-benefits.html" title=""&gt;REM&lt;/a&gt;, when you typically dream. The brain generally takes about 90 minutes to cycle through all four stages and then restarts the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Deep sleep and REM help your brain “heal itself” from fatigue and stress and consolidate memories, said Matthew Pase, an associate professor at the School of Psychological Sciences at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. In deep sleep, your brain regulates metabolism and hormones; it also acts as a “rinse” for the brain, clearing out waste. REM is when your brain processes emotions and new information you picked up when you were awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The two phases influence dementia risk in different ways, scientists think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As part of the rinsing process in deep sleep, your brain flushes out amyloid proteins that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Years of interrupted deep sleep and incomplete flushing — known as &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8186542/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;glymphatic failure&lt;/a&gt; — could hasten the onset of dementia, said Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who researches the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chances are, when you wake up, it’s been at least a few hours since you’ve had anything to drink. “After hours without fluid, your body (and brain!) are craving it,” says &lt;a href="https://alexandria-hardy-rdn.clientsecure.me/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandria Hardy, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, of Pennsylvania Nutrition Services.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re out of touch with your thirst signals, you may not even think to drink water when you wake up. However, it’s important to replenish the fluids lost during sleep. “While we sleep, we lose water from sweating and breathing. That’s why it’s important to refill our tank in the morning!” says &lt;a href="https://flavorfulnutrition.com/stacy-davis-registered-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stacy Roberts-Davis, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Flavorful Nutrition LLC.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s even more important if you didn’t hydrate well the day before. “If you didn’t drink enough water the day before, you might &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8064290/how-to-tell-if-you-are-dehydrated/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;wake up dehydrated&lt;/a&gt;,” says Roberts-Davis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking water first thing can help your body wake up and start your day feeling good,” says Roberts-Davis. Studies show that hydration is closely linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. For example, one study found that participants with a lower hydration status also had a greater decline in their cognitive function over a two-year period.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the many functions of fluids is promoting healthy digestion. Your body needs fluids to soften stool and make it easier to pass. It works hand-in-hand with fiber to do just that. Especially if you &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;struggle with constipation&lt;/a&gt;, you may notice digestive benefits from adding a glass of water to your morning routine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Hydration helps ensure proper kidney function and aids in preventing kidney stones,” says &lt;a href="https://theeverydaykidneycook.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beverly Garden, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Your kidneys need water to remove waste through your urine. If there’s too little water, the waste may collect in your blood and be unable to reach your kidneys. It’s also more likely that certain substances will crystallize in your kidneys, forming kidney stones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, studies show that drinking more fluids is linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-to-prevent-kidney-stones-11705389" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced risk of kidney stones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking water in the morning may also help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-lower-blood-pressure-8611460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. One study examined the benefits of adding about 18 ounces of water upon waking and another 18 ounces before bed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It found that this hydration regimen (which added up to about 2 liters of total fluid per day) led to a decrease in blood pressure. Why? Drinking more water helps remove excess sodium, alters hormones involved in blood pressure management and makes it easier for blood to flow through your blood vessels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even if it seems simple, we know that it’s not always easy to adopt a new healthy habit. Dietitians shared a few easy strategies for improving your morning hydration:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Water on Your Nightstand: &lt;/strong&gt;“Keep water handy at your bedside. Then, drink 8 to 16 ounces right away before even getting out of bed,” suggests Garden. This can help you remember to hydrate before you get busy preparing for your day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair It with Another Habit:&lt;/strong&gt; Pairing a new habit with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906041/things-you-should-do-before-8-am-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;an existing one&lt;/a&gt; may make it easier to adopt, like pairing a glass of water with your morning medications or supplements. “Many pills actually require a full glass of water to be absorbed properly in the body. By drinking a full glass when you wake up, you are aiding in your daily water intake as well,” says &lt;a href="https://www.arugalyssa.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Smolen, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a media and community dietitian. Don’t take pills in the morning? Challenge yourself to finish a glass of water before your coffee brews, or sip on herbal tea as you read the morning news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Overlook Other Sources of Hydration:&lt;/strong&gt; “Whether it’s hot tea, a green smoothie or a tall glass of water, starting your morning strong with hydration is key,” says Hardy. Notice that it doesn’t only have to be water. Incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-no-added-sugar-drinks-to-hydrate-8675270" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;other drinks&lt;/a&gt;, like herbal tea or smoothies, into your morning can help hydrate you at the start of your day. Also keep in mind that incorporating water-rich foods at breakfast also counts toward your hydration needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adopting healthy morning habits doesn’t have to be time-consuming. In fact, dietitians agree that the healthiest habit to start before 9 a.m. is simply hydrating. Starting your day off with a glass of water may counter nighttime dehydration, promote alertness, support healthy digestion and blood pressure and lower your risk of kidney stones. If you don’t love water, try a smoothie or a cup of herbal tea. To meet your overall fluid needs, be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-way-to-stay-hydrated-ally-love-interview-8702860" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keep your hydration up&lt;/a&gt; throughout the rest of the day, too!

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists — the powerful ingredients behind Wegovy and  Ozempic — have long been hailed a monumental breakthrough in the war on obesity and type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In March, an &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14482729/weight-loss-jabs-triple-risk-depression-suicide-alarming-effect.html"&gt;eight-year long study&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span&gt;160,000 obese patients found those taking the drugs had nearly treble the normal risk of depression and double the risk of anxiety, as well as three times the risk of suicidal behaviour, compared with people who weren't on the drugs. &lt;/span&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest analysis, led by 24 researchers across the United States, Brazil, Iran, and Israel, found long-term use of these drugs could disrupt signals sent by dopamine in the brain, potentially leading to depressive symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commonly referred to as the happiness hormone, dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the brain's pleasure and reward systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the paper, published in the journal Current Neuropharmacology, scientists examined the DNA of individuals with hypodopaminergia - a condition characterised by reduced dopamine activity in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using computer simulation software, the researchers studied the interaction between GLP-1 agonists and genes associated with dopamine signaling, including DRD3, BDNF and CREB1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that GLP1 receptor antagonists can disrupt the levels of dopamine in those with genes that reduce the activity of dopamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This imbalance, they concluded, may increase the risk of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers are now urging clinicians to consider genetic tests to better protect individuals who are at a high risk of developing depression whilst taking the popular weight loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Panayotis K. Thanos of Buffalo University commented: 'Before prescribing GLP1 receptor agonists, it would be prudent to use genetic testing tools to assess a patient’s dopamine function and risk profile.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While GLP-1 receptor agonists hold promise, we must remain vigilant about their potential harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study is not intended to break the bubble of hope but to add a layer of precaution in their over-prescription,' Professor Igor Elman of Harvard University added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wegovy carries a depression warning on its label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, it can spread if animals or people come into contact with the tapeworm's eggs, which are present in the feces of those infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The parasite enters the body and then multiplies in the liver. In humans, the fox tapeworm can cause an extremely rare liver-related infection known as alveolar echinococcosis (AE) that can lead to liver failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A group of Swiss scientists have now discovered that cases of the tapeworm caused-infection, though still rare, are increasing by nearly three times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, while the parasite was once contained in Europe, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-90190161-2155-11f0-b6dc-cb5820c2b3f0"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-90197690-2155-11f0-b6dc-cb5820c2b3f0"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; and Siberia, it is now spreading to regions of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-90190160-2155-11f0-b6dc-cb5820c2b3f0"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and parts of the United States, particularly in the Midwest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is not reportable in the US, however, which makes it difficult to track and monitor the prevalence. The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-58947100-2157-11f0-b293-45006be3a59f"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; classifies the infection as a serious public health concern, particularly in areas with high populations of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, data from the University Hospital Zurich shows in 1993, there were about two cases of AE recorded by the institution, while in 2022 - the latest year available - the number jumped to about 14. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Also known as the fox tapeworm, the parasite infects small rodents who unknowingly eat the feces and then multiplies in their livers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those involved in the study examined medical records of 334 patients who had alveolar echinococcosis were all treated at the University Hospital of Zurich between 1973 and 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of the 334 patients, 151 had some type of surgery to remove the parasites while 315 received drug therapy with the medication benzimidazole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They analyzed patient demographics, symptoms at diagnosis, AE stage, treatment strategy, treatment outcome, survival and causes of death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that over the 50-year study period, 90 patients died but mostly from causes other than the parasitic infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only 13 deaths were directly caused by AE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Survival analyses also showed that those with AE had lower survival rates compared with the general population five years after diagnosis, especially those who were diagnosed with AE later in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, AE did not appear to be the main driver of their shortened life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that without benzimidazole therapy, 90 percent of patients died within 10 years of disease onset but with long-term therapy, they were able to prevent a disease from worsening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also concluded that removing all of the parasite-damaged tissue in the body through surgery could improve overall survival but could not slow down the disease.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unclear why, authors of the study speculate that 'the gradual decline of relative survival five years after diagnosis could reflect a generally sicker population.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accidentally ingesting tapeworm eggs often through contaminated food, water or soil, or through direct contact with infected animals can help the parasite enter the human body and begin spreading infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;AE causes parasitic tumors, primarily in the liver, that can spread to other organs like the lungs and brain in humans &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AE causes parasitic tumors, primarily in the liver, that can spread to other organs like the lungs and brain in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the parasite doesn't fully mature into cysts, it invades and destroys tissue, leading to liver failure and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include &lt;span&gt;abdominal pain, jaundice, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-ed685270-2151-11f0-b6dc-cb5820c2b3f0" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;span&gt; weakness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, people at high risk include 'trappers, hunters, veterinarians, or others who have contact with wild foxes, or coyotes, or their stool, or household dogs and cats that have the opportunity to eat wild rodents infected with AE'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The federal agency also recommends washing and cooking wild-picked foods carefully, keeping pets away from wild animals and their feces as well as maintaining good hand hygiene, especially after contact with animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 00:50:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQZThIWnY5OHNFWWxldVRBU0hyVUI1UWdTR09JU1VXb0RrQXl6Y2tmdThvWFBfdHNqZmpHQWEtQXoxQXJBRzVScjBETXNaNUxCRU9TSktFZlRXWmhSVVJoam5XUUl6VjA1ZnJtSml1NWlPWUFVQWtPa2VvOE9VU1VuLXN6X3BOU0VhTkRXQjZWYnBjSFlMajViWmkwcU9JOFBX0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1BRngtRGx3YlB1anhyTFZOa0tzQjE5TERVWFlXb2dzUnZma0ozSlh4ZElMc2FFU1BpcEFDR1Y2WG1mNVRjUHlSbkdXSTFNRjlmZGFQOVRVdjFKa1lpRml3STVWNi1uTmJYaldDT1RGOUpaY3dvT2dRazF6NXNNRzV4c0piMkRWMzhycmxZaHp5V1dmaHZMQ2JMMnM1QmVWZVVMUDJDNEE</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，如果儿童疫苗接种率继续下降，未来25年美国麻疹病例可能会增加数百万- CNN | US may have millions more measles cases over next 25 years if childhood vaccination rates continue to decline, study says -

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuxidq001w27qe64iucdk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles could become endemic in the United States if routine childhood vaccination rates continue to decline, with up to 51 million illnesses over a 25-year period, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00053b6m82bxpye7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the disease is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;endemic in some other countries&lt;/a&gt; – meaning it happens regularly within an area or community – it was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the US in 2000 because of vaccination efforts with the highly effective measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00063b6m29exny5w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nearly 900 measles cases have been recorded in the US this year, with more than half of states reporting at least one case, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the cases have been linked with &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/health/measles-cases-us-dg/index.html"&gt;an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; centered on an area of West Texas with a large unvaccinated population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00073b6mvoyrvp0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt;, published Thursday in the journal JAMA, looks at the potential spread of the disease in the US over 25 years based on different vaccination levels calculated using data from 2004-23.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00083b6mlu0dxd1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers – from Stanford, Baylor, Rice and Texas A&amp;amp;M universities – estimate current state-by-state vaccination coverage for measles at 87.7% to 95.6%. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd00093b6mk9hms08e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because measles is so contagious, experts say the only way to prevent outbreaks is if at least 95% of a community has received two doses of the MMR vaccine. After this rate was maintained for a decade, though, coverage dipped during the Covid-19 pandemic and has yet to recover. The measles vaccination rate fell to 92.7% for kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement/index.html"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000a3b6mlhgbp34x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At current vaccination rates, the model predicts that the disease would become endemic in the US within 25 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000b3b6mhy8wpgg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the vaccination rate declines 10%, the US would see 11.1 million cases of measles over this period.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000c3b6mffd0xrw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If current trends were reversed and there was a 5% increase in the number of people getting the MMR vaccine, however, there would be only 5,800 measles cases over 25 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000d3b6md4n41vv0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The model showed that other vaccine-preventable diseases shouldn’t become endemic in the US at current levels of vaccination. If, however, routine childhood vaccination falls 50%, it predicts 51.2 million measles cases over a 25-year period, 9.9 million cases of rubella, 4.3 million cases of poliomyelitis and 197 cases of diphtheria. With such a steep decline in vaccinations, these diseases would cause 10.3 million hospitalizations and 159,000 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vuyeqd000e3b6mmbu6r3ht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These findings support the need to continue routine childhood vaccination at high coverage to prevent resurgence of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in the US,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzpf3x0001336mdb32zqti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the limitations of the study is that it doesn’t take into account that vaccination rates can fluctuate from community to community. Essentially, each state gets its own bucket, noted Dr. Mujeeb Basit, a modeling expert on disease spread who wasn’t involved with the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzhjpw0007336mfqy3pe9r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But the problem with that is, you’re comparing Texas to a smaller state like Rhode Island. So it’s not a homogenous distribution by size, so the accuracy of the numbers will fluctuate,” said Basit, a professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzz2gg00033b6mbwu23tno@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he said the issue is computationally difficult, and the researchers took a “really nice approach.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vzc3q30005336memsoa2fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this is important, he said, because it shows clearly that if vaccination trends continue, the US could experience continuous measles outbreaks that would have a cascading effect on the health system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9w003yb00093b6md9486cdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hopefully, it will get people to think,” he said – and to act, getting protection through vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Adopting healthier habits in midlife also has benefits for older age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study involved data from hundreds of children who were born in the Finnish city of Jyvaskyla in 1959. They completed health checks when they were 27 years old and again when they were aged 36, 42, 50 and 61. This involved assessing three risky behaviours — if they &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/french-paradox-heart-health-britain-xgjg9wksx" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;smoked, drank heavily and were inactive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;All three habits were associated with declines in both mental and physical health, with the effects apparent by the time participants were in their mid-thirties. Indulging in all three habits was particularly bad for health in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The habits were linked to an array of non-infectious diseases such as heart disease and cancer, which cause almost three quarters of deaths worldwide. “By following a healthy lifestyle, an individual can cut their risk of developing these illnesses and reduce their odds of an early death,” said Kekalainen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQeVplRXp6RlhZMWhlajlva0l0UXpQemx6S3pqblRIb1BJc3p1Y0xYVDFpRXhDT3U2LUo0ZlphRnZLOFlCUmVMOUFfbG81bndhRVJ3ZTlfMjJfSmN6VVg3MTJqZ0FoLUROQ1ZMUS1pNldWUXM4elk1dnBPck9MVWh1TE91cElxTGdWWFQ2UE1uMFQ5eXNCOEE</guid></item><item><title>犹他州情侣分享终末期痴呆症诊断之旅- KSL TV 5 | Utah couple shares journey navigating a terminal dementia diagnosis - KSL TV 5</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQckZfTDdJTFh4QmVvMTVwTmViOW01REFkenQ1bGg3RmVEc0FIYlVNMGF2cjFwZUpkVUZJTU5DeHBiZlF0eTR2YXQyX3lBdVNjcXByZW94MzA1U3pBWHFzM2Y1dlhGa3Z1bDIwaTJ5MnR0Y1BreU1TeGlaNWpmMzFROE9xRG9GSlc4RTB6Q0VCMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;TAYLORSVILLE — Misplacing car keys or having trouble remembering a specific date are normal signs of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when is it “just getting older” and when could it be a more serious problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A dementia diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack and Debbie Lucas know firsthand how conditions like dementia can take a toll on an entire family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard for me when I can’t remember something,” 69-year-old Debbie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_767249" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-767249" class="wp-image-767249 size-full" src="https://ksltv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/brain_health_2_042425-e1745535279315.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-767249" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack and Debbie Lucas know firsthand how conditions like dementia can take a toll on an entire family. (KSL TV)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debbie, whose mother had Alzheimer’s, went in for a cognitive test seven years ago and was told she had Alzheimer’s. But through additional genetic testing, she was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which affects less than one in 30 people with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To have that ultimate diagnosis of ‘it’s terminal’ was pretty significant,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Frontotemporal dementia affects patients when certain areas of their brain start decreasing,” said Dr. Angel Lybbert, a geriatrician at Intermountain Health. “There’s different variants. You can have a language variant where it affects your ability to find words more prominently, and you can have a behavioral variant where your personality might change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four main types of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and FTD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack said they are hoping for more research to be done on frontotemporal dementia, as Debbie’s genetic variant is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just recently that we’re even delving into diagnosing people on that level and having the ability to do that with genetic testing,” Lybbert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Signs of normal aging vs. dementia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While occasional confusion or forgetfulness can be normal with aging, Lybbert said signs of dementia include significant memory lapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You might see it in someone who is asking questions repetitively or having to be told about appointment times and things that you had just reviewed with them, forgetting important events, forgetting how to do things that were second nature; for example, navigating somewhere in the car to a familiar place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_767253" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-767253" class="wp-image-767253 size-full" src="https://ksltv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Debbie-Jack-Lucas-family-Apr-2025-e1745535423688.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-767253" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lucas family is celebrating Debbie’s birthday with roller skating. (Photo courtesy: Jack and Debbie Lucas)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lybbert said you can keep your brain sharp by getting regular exercise, eating pa healthy diet that includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, getting adequate sleep, managing medical conditions like high blood pressure, and staying mentally and socially engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Being isolated is a risk factor for dementia, so it’s important to keep those conversations going,” Lybbert said. “If it’s not in your personality to be super outgoing, have tons of friends, you don’t need to change who you are, but you have to talk to someone at least once a day. Just make sure you’re not spending days at a time alone in your home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack and Debbie take walks every day and continue to participate in other activities they enjoy, like roller skating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It helps me a lot to go visit the grandkids, to take them for an ice cream,” Debbie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your quality of life is enhanced when you’re staying active, you’re eating right, and being involved socially, those typical things that you would do in any cognitive or dementia situation,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One day at a time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some days are better than others, and Jack added that being a caregiver can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When your spouse starts not remembering your past…life is kind of made up of memories, and when you don’t have that, it’s an interesting aspect going forward,” Jack said. “It’s been more of an emotional rollercoaster for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But through it all — they’re still able to laugh and live life in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s, you know, something that we can enjoy together for the moment,” Jack said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any memory-related concerns, talk to your primary care doctor. For people ages 65 and older, a mini cognitive screening is part of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit.&lt;/p&gt;

The infected bat’s carcass was frozen and then sent to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OC Health Care Agency encourages anyone who made physical contact with the bat — or saw anyone else do so — to inform its Disease Control Division to determine the risk of infection. Owners of pets that may have touched the bat are also asked to contact health authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is almost always fatal in humans once someone begins to show symptoms, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/bat-found-rancho-santa-margarita-tests-positive-rabies" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Health Care Agency. That’s why it’s important for people to seek medical assistance promptly after a possible exposure, officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is spread through an infected animal’s saliva, usually during a bite. Because bats have small teeth, their bites typically go unnoticed, heightening the risk of infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of April, the Los Angeles County &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/vet/rabiesmap2025.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Department of Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has documented two rabid bats this year, both around the Santa Clarita area. One of the bats was found dead in a residential backyard, the other was alive in the front yard of a home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-27/fresno-county-rabies-bat-bite-fatal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In 2024, Fresno County&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recorded its first human rabies fatality in more than 30 years. The person was infected after being bitten by a bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases of rabies are rare, but bats are the leading source of transmission, according to Orange County health officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 22:59:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOVHJDNTZKNVl0TThXZkJYd3FLYlY0bTQzLVhaSU56NVk5UWJNTkR2LUNkSHV0V3pWeHpMcGkyV1lZSHg5VWdEWkdVTFY1VC1iY1huZHpRdzY4TDM4andmQlB5clJuRm14Yk1mQU9QMHYyZlNlSmk0T0FGQ1oxZTQ2ZmhZWVhtVlRIX3h0N0tEWGZwbERjZE8wNjBDMVdEeFUzUjlTcW82ZWE</guid></item><item><title>不信任RFK Jr.的公共卫生领导者站出来捍卫疫苗- statnews.com | Public health leaders, distrustful of RFK Jr., stand up project to defend vaccines - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQOVZ6dTNuMll1T2YwMENycmxCTExnRGFXV0F6MGJTQ1hYZFJJeGl6M055MkVCcEJNdVBjQTZXekdseW5ZajJ5anAydEJuOHo2anNhZU8teTNBZ2thblA3WVd1U3pPcHV4aDEySU92QWYyY21vRWc3a0hnR0ZJOUJIRnNWX1ZmSTZDeW5qazJLVlM1VnVDakNFNg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some key public health figures are taking an extraordinary step to try to shore up U.S. vaccination policy, feared to be under threat from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-vaccines-kennedy-confirmation-hearing-vaccination-policy-hhs-secretary/"&gt;longtime vaccine critic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “Vaccine Integrity Project,” which was publicly launched Thursday by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, will be aimed at assessing the best ways for vaccine proponents to safeguard vaccination policy and information, should government recommendations and information sources become “corrupted,” Michael Osterholm, director of the center, said during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though plans for the project are still taking shape, Osterholm said it might go so far as to create a new independent body to evaluate the science supporting individual vaccines — a task that at this point falls squarely in the domain of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osterholm stressed, though, that the body, if formed, could not serve as a shadow version of the ACIP. That’s because it would not have the same legal authorities as the ACIP, such as deciding which vaccines must be provided through the Vaccines for Children Program. The program provides vaccinations for free to children who qualify; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333e1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;just over half&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. children are eligible for vaccines through VFC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Margaret Hamburg, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Harvey Fineberg, a former president of the Institute of Medicine — now known as the National Academy of Medicine — will chair a steering committee that will spend the summer meeting with key stakeholders to decide how the project should proceed. They suggested some of the actions the group may explore include developing clinical guidelines and identifying areas where further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We take up the Vaccine Integrity Project as a precautionary step,” the two wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/vaccine-integrity-project-acip-cdc-fda-rfk-jr-trump-political-interference"&gt;an opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in STAT. “Should ACIP or FDA processes or scientific evaluation become compromised, America cannot afford to be left without any organized systems to ensure that evidence grounded in science continues to guide decisions about the use of vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrew Nixon, HHS communications director, dismissed the project as an “unaccountable group of former officials circling the wagons to protect outdated narratives.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy and Director Bhattacharya will continue to prioritize open scientific debate and [the] Gold Standard of Science to inform decision making,” Nixon wrote in an email. Jay Bhattacharya is the director of the National Institutes of Health, an agency that neither approves vaccines nor makes recommendations on how they should be used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy for years led Children’s Health Defense, an organization that opposes vaccine mandates and argues that vaccines themselves are dangerous despite health officials’ and experts’ statements to the contrary. He also has been involved in a number of personal injury lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since being confirmed as HHS secretary, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;stressed that getting vaccinated is a personal choice&lt;/a&gt; and has demanded that agency websites under his control highlight that view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though the country is in the grips of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/18/measles-outbreak-could-last-a-year-texas-public-health-official-predicts/"&gt;one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades&lt;/a&gt; — an outbreak that has already claimed three lives — he has refrained from publicly urging parents to get their children vaccinated. Though it is common for public health leaders to strongly advocate for vaccination in such situations, the furthest Kennedy has gone is to say that vaccination is the best way to contain measles. He has also &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/10/rfk-jr-measles-vaccines-outbreak-comments/"&gt;raised safety concerns about the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested two children who died from measles in West Texas actually succumbed to other illnesses. (In addition to the Texas children, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico died.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;He has been a vocal critic of the ACIP, alleging that the vast majority of its members have conflicts of interests. There have been fears that he might try to replace members of the committee with people whose views on vaccines are more aligned with his own, or undermine its work in other ways. Earlier this week &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/22/trump-pull-covid-vaccine-recommendation-children-00304091" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Politico reported&lt;/a&gt; that he is considering unilaterally striking Covid vaccines from the childhood vaccination schedule, a guide devised by the ACIP and the CDC and used by medical professionals to determine which vaccines children should receive, and at what age. If Covid vaccines were no longer listed on the childhood immunization schedule, insurance companies would not have to pay for the vaccines and they would not be eligible for provision through the Vaccines for Children Program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said that the aim of the Vaccine Integrity Project is to try to establish a roadmap for what could be done if government sources of information on vaccines can no longer be trusted. “We all recognize that the vaccine enterprise is at some risk right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The effort is being funded through an unrestricted grant from Alumbra, a foundation established by philanthropist Christy Walton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The discovery was made in a residential backyard in Maine where researchers were collecting rabbit ticks and testing them for pathogens, according to &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-tick-researchers-identify-new-strain-rickettsia-bacteria-causes-spotted" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The new bacteria, &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia &lt;/i&gt;sp. ME2023, can cause spotted fever rickettsioses in humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which has a death rate of 20 to 30 percent if not treated promptly with the antibiotic doxycycline, the statement said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When the ticks from Maine tested positive for a bacteria like the one that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Guang Xu, a research professor of microbiology at UMass Amherst, conducted DNA testing that identified a distinct new strain, “unlike any other known strain,” but similar to one that caused severe cases of fever in California a few years ago, the statement said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We now know there is something different, something novel, than what was previously known,” Stephen Rich, a microbiologist at UMass Amherst, said in the statement. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Although rabbit ticks can be found throughout North and South America, they are uncommon in New England. Deer ticks,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;which are carriers of Lyme Disease, and dog ticks are the ones that most commonly bite people, researchers said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“So, it was a mystery,” Xu said. “Why are there some cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in New England? This finding may solve part of the puzzle. Maybe the rabbit ticks are the vector.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The discovery was made by scientists working on &lt;a href="https://www.newvec.org/itch" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.newvec.org/itch"&gt;Project ITCH&lt;/a&gt;, an acronym for Is Tick Control Helping, which surveys residential properties across New England, to develop best practices for local trick control. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Researchers next plan to work with rabbit hunters in Massachusetts to collect more ticks and further their understanding of the potential impact on public health, Rich said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Collaborating researchers at the University of Maine sent UMass Amherst more rabbit ticks to test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The test results showed that out of 296 ticks collected from 38 towns in nine counties in Maine, 6.1 percent tested positive for the new &lt;i&gt;Rickettsia&lt;/i&gt; genotype, according to the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This wasn’t a needle in a haystack,” said Rich, executive director of the New England Center of Excellence in Vector-borne Diseases at UMass Amherst. “It looks like lots of the rabbit ticks there have this pathogen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Though rabbit ticks don’t often feed on people, researchers are eager to figure out the risk and possibility of “spill over” into ticks that bite both rabbits and people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“For example, a deer tick could feed on a rabbit and pick up this infection from the rabbit tick and potentially infect a person with that,” Rich said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But some experts on tick-borne diseases and disorders caution that the rabbit tick research is still in the early stages. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While the findings are “interesting,” it is “premature to say that it has any public health significance,” said Sam Telford III, professor and director of the department of infectious disease and global health at Tufts University.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Epidemiological studies are needed to make that determination, Telford said in an email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There are many infectious agents that are maintained by ticks, but relatively few of them have been demonstrated to cause human disease,” Telford said. “This demonstration rests on actual case reports of human disease.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Professor Thomas Mather, who heads the Tick Encounter Resource Center at the University of Rhode Island, said that since rabbit ticks rarely bite humans they probably don’t “represent much of a direct risk for humans.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Out of more than 85,000 photos of ticks submitted to the University of Rhode Island’s tick survey, only two or three were this type of rabbit tick, Mather said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“People rarely encounter them,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“But, it definitely could help the new strain circulate more widely in nature with an increasing risk for spillover” from ticks that do bite humans, Mather added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Spotted-fever infections, typically spread by dog ticks, have climbed in the past two decades in the United States from 495 cases in 2002 to a peak of 6,248 in 2017, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;More than half of the cases between 2018 and 2022 were from Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee, according to the CDC.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

			&lt;p&gt;We know sleep quality is vital &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds"&gt;for good health&lt;/a&gt;, that adolescence is an important time &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/teens-brains-develop-differently-depending-on-if-theyre-night-owls-or-early-birds"&gt;for brain development&lt;/a&gt;, and that teens don't always get a huge amount of sleep – and new research gives us some fresh insights into how that all fits together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With data for 3,222 adolescents between the ages of 9 and 14 years of age, researchers from institutions in China and the UK split the cohort up into three groups: those with the worst sleep habits (averaging 7 hours, 10 minutes per night), those with the best &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; (7 hours, 25 minutes), and those in between (7 hours, 21 minutes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there wasn't much difference between these groups in terms of academic achievement, the best sleepers showed noticeable improvements in cognitive tests for reading, problem solving, and focus, compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-brain-starts-eating-itself-when-it-doesn-t-get-enough-sleep"&gt;worst sleepers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159118" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159118" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepBiotypes.jpg" alt="Sleep biotypes" class="wp-image-159118 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepBiotypes.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepBiotypes-630x415.jpg 630w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepBiotypes-600x395.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159118" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers used sleep data to put the participants into three groups. In terms of overall sleep performance, biotype 3 is the best, biotype 1 is the worst, and biotype 2 is in the middle. (Ma et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even though the differences in the amount of sleep that each group got was relatively small, at just over a quarter-of-an-hour between the best and worst sleepers, we could still see differences in brain structure and activity and in how well they did at tasks," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/adolescents-who-sleep-longer-perform-better-at-cognitive-tasks"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; clinical neuropsychologist Barbara Sahakian from the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This drives home to us just how important it is to have a good night's sleep at this important time in life."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of young people who slept the longest per night was also observed to have the largest brain volumes, the lowest &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heart-rate-zones-explained-heres-how-to-optimize-your-exercise-routine"&gt;heart rates&lt;/a&gt;, and the highest levels of brain connectivity, compared to the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159120" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepPatterns.jpg" alt="Sleep patterns over time" class="wp-image-159120 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepPatterns.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/SleepPatterns-600x298.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159120" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cognitive performance and brain characteristics were tracked over time. (Ma et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhat worryingly, most of the young people fell into the group with the poorest set of sleep data: 39 percent of the total. The middle group had 24 percent of the participants in it, while the group that scored highest on sleep made up 37 percent of the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research isn't enough to prove cause and effect when it comes to sleep and brain function, and it's worth noting that the cognitive differences between the groups weren't huge – but taken with other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/delay-school-day-adolescents-improves-wellbeing-and-alertness"&gt;similar studies&lt;/a&gt;, it adds to the evidence that young brains need to be protected by sleep, and that every minute counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although our study can't answer conclusively whether young people have better brain function and perform better at tests because they sleep better, there are a number of studies that would support this idea," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/adolescents-who-sleep-longer-perform-better-at-cognitive-tasks"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychologist Qing Ma from Fudan University in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other pieces of research have gone into plenty of detail about how sleep is linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/deep-sleep-is-the-anti-anxiety-drug-we-ve-been-looking-for-brain-scans-reveal"&gt;mental well-being&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt;, and this latest study is a reminder to teens and parents to maybe spend a few minutes less &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/screen-time-in-bed-may-increase-insomnia-odds-study-suggests"&gt;on mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Regularly getting a good night's sleep is important in helping us function properly," &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/adolescents-who-sleep-longer-perform-better-at-cognitive-tasks"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sahakian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While we know a lot about sleep in adulthood and later life, we know surprisingly little about sleep in adolescence, even though this is a crucial time in our development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115565"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

By identifying unique DNA junctions from each patient’s tumor, the test can detect tumor DNA in the bloodstream, even before changes appear on MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These DNA fragments bypass some limitations of the blood-brain barrier, offering a sensitive early warning for disease advancement. The test detected tumor activity in 93% of cases, showing promise as a clinical tool for tailoring treatments and monitoring outcomes in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA Junction Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers targeted tumor-specific DNA junctions, which are more abundant and easier to detect than other fragments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Tumor DNA levels in blood sometimes rose before any visible MRI changes, offering earlier insights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Accuracy:&lt;/strong&gt; The personalized test detected tumor DNA in 93% of patients with known DNA junctions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a potential new way to monitor the progression of high-grade gliomas, one of the most aggressive types of brain cancer. Their feasibility study suggests that a personalized blood test tailored to each patient’s tumor DNA could provide a faster and less invasive way to determine if the cancer is advancing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, clinicians rely on scans and surgical biopsies to monitor gliomas, but both methods have limitations. For example, scans often cannot distinguish tumor growth from treatment effects such as inflammation. Biopsies require invasive procedures, making them impractical for routine monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109109"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a test tube." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/DNA-blood-glioma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The test detected tumor DNA in approximately 93% of the cases where these DNA junctions were present. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach, published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt;, may provide clinicians with another tool to monitor tumor changes over time and adjust treatment as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings focus on tumor DNA fragments circulating in the blood. As gliomas grow, some glioma cells die, shedding pieces of their DNA into the bloodstream and leaving behind genetic markers that are unique to the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, gliomas release fewer DNA fragments into the blood compared to many other cancers. This is because of the blood-brain barrier, a natural brain defense that prevents many substances from leaving the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this limitation, researchers focused on DNA junctions, a type of tumor-specific DNA fragment that is present in higher quantities. By targeting these markers, researchers achieved greater sensitivity, enabling them to detect even the smallest signs of tumor progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike normal DNA, which follows a structured sequence, these DNA junctions form when the tumor’s genetic material breaks and rearranges. The study found that these amplified DNA junctions, due to their higher numbers, may provide a clearer picture of disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research builds on years of studying genetic rearrangements and gives us a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving gliomas,” says lead author George Vasmatzis, Ph.D., co-director of the Biomarker Discovery Program at Mayo Clinic’s Center for Individualized Medicine and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It offers new possibilities for patient-specific monitoring and targeted interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers analyzed samples from patients with high-grade gliomas. They used whole genome sequencing to map each tumor’s unique genetic blueprint and pinpointed patient-specific DNA junctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then developed personalized blood tests to search for these genetic markers in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test detected tumor DNA in approximately 93% of the cases where these DNA junctions were present. In some patients, tumor DNA levels in the blood rose before MRI scans showed any changes — offering a potential early signal for disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connecting cutting-edge research and clinical practice, Dr. Vasmatzis and Terry Burns, M.D., Ph.D., a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, collaborated on the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By tracking each tumor’s distinct molecular signature, we’re aiming to shift from a reactive approach to one that’s far more proactive,” says Dr. Burns, a study co-author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research could lay the groundwork for tools that help clinicians make the most informed treatment decisions as early as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will evaluate how well blood-based tumor tracking correlates with glioma progression across a larger group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain cancer and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89e7ecfefaebfcfbece8fcc9e4e8f0e6a7ecedfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sharon Theimer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mayo.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sharon Theimer – Mayo Clinic&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-3233/754481/Personalized-Tumor-Specific-Amplified-DNA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Personalized Tumor-Specific Amplified DNA Junctions in Peripheral Blood of Patients with High-Grade Gliomas&lt;/a&gt;” by George Vasmatzis et al. &lt;em&gt;Clinical Cancer Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Tumor-Specific Amplified DNA Junctions in Peripheral Blood of Patients with High-Grade Gliomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring disease progression in patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG) is challenging due to treatment-related changes in imaging and the requirement for neurosurgical intervention to obtain diagnostic tissue. DNA junctions in HGG often amplify oncogenes, making these DNA fragments potentially more abundant in blood than monoallelic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we piloted a cell-free DNA approach for disease detection in the plasma of patients with HGG by leveraging patient-specific DNA junctions associated with oncogene amplifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental Design:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole-genome sequencing of grade 3 or 4 isocitrate dehydrogenase–mutant or wild-type astrocytomas was utilized to identify amplified junctions. Individualized qPCR assays were developed using patient-specific primers designed for the amplified junction. ctDNA levels containing these junctions were measured in patient plasma samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unique amplified junctions were evaluated by individualized semi-qPCR assays in presurgical plasma of 18 patients, 15 with tumor-associated focal amplifications and three without tumor-associated focal amplifications. high copy-number junctions were robustly detected in the plasma of 14 of 15 (93.3%) patients with amplified junctions and none of the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in junction abundance correlated with disease trajectory in serial plasma samples from five patients, including increased abundance of amplified junctions preceding radiographic disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients with grade 3 or 4 astrocytomas who had tumor-associated amplifications, patient-specific amplified junctions were successfully detected in assayed plasma from most patients. Longitudinal analysis of plasma samples correlated with disease trajectory, including cytoreduction and progression.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 21:49:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBUdml6VWFXM3BPR2pvTV9WYnFXZXJ3YWEwSjZNckhrX2t4TThtM281bnFaa0xFc0hoTk56NzVNZHV4NGhnZUdEZElKeHBOeEdIVUVkQ3JUVWRvNU9fRkRiUFlKQzdRX19hejdJc0x1TW0</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，您摄入的蛋白质可以帮助您延长寿命- EatingWell | The Kind of Protein You Eat Could Help You Live Longer, New Study Suggests - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFBVb1ZSV1pHb25FTDl0dDVOUlFLNW04cWVzUWl5bDk0b0xpeDByeE9jaXE1c0Rhb3hfak5UcVFrUzRzQm5oX0dHRlY5bzU2bC13TmYyTzdJUkhNVnFObGk5RmlBVkpMMzVXVkxv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that eating plant-based protein may help you live longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers also suggest that animal-based protein is advantageous early in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can slowly add more plant-based protein to your diet with flexitarian recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over the last few years, there has been mounting evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7775696/plant-based-diet-for-beginners-your-guide-to-getting-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more plants&lt;/a&gt;—including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds—benefits health in many ways, primarily in reducing disease risk. This is partly due to plants’ effects on our microbiomes, as they provide plenty of fiber that acts as food for beneficial bacteria to thrive and multiply. A healthy microbiome has been linked with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fiber-intake-metabolic-disease-risk-research-8729291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s not all, though. Plants also contain antioxidants, vitamins and minerals necessary for optimal health, plus macronutrients, including healthy fats, carbohydrates and protein. It’s this last nutrient that researchers in Australia wanted to take a closer look at. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study is a little different, as most studies we cover assess individuals’ dietary habits. This study, on the other hand, takes a broader look at the food available in different countries and how long people in those countries tend to live. The findings were published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s see what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study aimed to assess how the nutritional environment is associated with age-specific mortality (death) in 101 countries. Specifically, it considered animal-based protein (ABP; meat, poultry, seafood dairy and eggs) and plant-based protein (PBP) availability in these countries to see how they were associated with longevity. To do so, researchers used the geometric framework for nutrition (GFN). This framework examines undernutrition, overnutrition and nutrient amounts and compositions—that includes which macro- and micronutrients foods are made up of). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also used food balance sheets (FBS) and life tables, which provide data on the average availability of food and nutrients at the national level and break the data down according to potential confounders that could skew results, like age, sex and the country’s level of wealth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Using these parameters, researchers could predict the effects of ABP, PBP, fat and carbohydrate availability on a country and assess their influence on longevity at different age points, specifically children who live to age 5 and adults who live to age 60.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, including adjusting for confounders, researchers found that higher animal-based protein supplies were associated with enhanced survival during infancy and early childhood, independent of total calorie supplies. In other words, regardless of how much total food is available in a country, higher availability of animal protein is linked with infants and children surviving to at least 5 years old. Researchers also found that when overall protein availability was low—regardless of the type of protein—survival rates were also low in infants and children under 5.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even so, plant-based protein was associated with better longevity in adults.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers explain that animal-based protein early in life provides complete proteins that are more easily digestible and absorbable compared to many plant-based protein sources.  In addition, compared to plants, animal-based protein also provides more fat and nutrients essential for proper growth and development in infancy and childhood. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, nutrients like iron, zinc and vitamin A are often lacking in developing countries where under-5 mortality is high, and animal-based protein may be an easier provider of these nutrients. Study authors note that some infant and childhood deaths can also be attributed to maternal undernutrition and deficiencies during pregnancy, and that providing animal-based protein may more easily help fill this gap. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is not to say that plant protein should be neglected in infancy and childhood, since researchers note that adding energy from any protein source—animal or plant—is better than not getting enough protein overall, especially in countries where food may be more scarce. They add that plant-based diets show promise for children, as long as they are balanced and varied to provide complete amino acids and enough fat for proper development.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, the association between animal proteins and longevity weakens as we age, with plant-based proteins becoming more positively influential, since another major finding of this study was that plant-based-rich environments were associated with improved survival later in life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note that the data used for this study cannot differentiate between ultra-processed foods and meats and other sources of animal protein, so they cannot state with certainty based on their study which types of animal proteins are linked to early death. With that said, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-foods-cardiovascular-disease-risk-8708994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; link regular consumption of ultra-processed foods, processed meats and foods high in added sugar with chronic disease—including heart disease, stroke and diabetes—and dying younger. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also linked higher fat availability, especially in countries where animal-based proteins were more plentiful, to dying younger. Though the researchers weren’t able to differentiate between processed meat and meat in general, one could hypothesize that some of the excessive fat consumption likely comes from ultra-processed foods and meats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study authors name several limitations of this study. For example, their findings are limited because they are based on national food supply data, not individual dietary intake. Because of this, they could not account for the many variables that can influence longevity. This analysis also doesn’t account for the differences between types of carbohydrates and fats, including the different types of carbs, like refined carbs, complex carbs with fiber and sugar, nor between saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it can mean different things to different people, eating plant-based doesn’t necessarily mean completely going vegan, or even vegetarian (which includes some animal products, like eggs and dairy). If you’re not ready to completely give up meat, consider increasing your intake of plants by swapping your typical meat-based recipes for more plant-forward ones. Some good sources of plant protein that are easy to start with include legumes, soy, tofu, nuts, seeds and whole grains, like quinoa and amaranth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a big fan of meat at dinner, you could also try some recipes that stretch animal-based protein with some tasty plant protein. That’s especially easy to do when you use ground meat, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269787/beef-bean-sloppy-joes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Beef &amp;amp; Bean Sloppy Joes&lt;/a&gt;, or when you make a fun grain bowl, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7870644/pesto-chicken-quinoa-bowls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Pesto Chicken Quinoa Bowls&lt;/a&gt;. Combining plant- and animal-based proteins is also the point of eating plans like the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/flexitarian-diet-dinner-recipes-for-beginners-7160257" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;flexitarian diet&lt;/a&gt;, which balances both for filling, tasty meals that can help you ease into trying out vegan protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also make some easy swaps to add more plants to your diet. For example, instead of pizza with pepperoni, sausage, ham or beef, make it a veggie pizza. Rather than having bacon and sausage with your eggs, consider making a veggie hash—like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7950433/sweet-potato-broccoli-wild-rice-hash/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sweet Potato, Broccoli &amp;amp; Wild Rice Hash&lt;/a&gt;—or something saucy like these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/264141/baked-eggs-in-tomato-sauce-with-kale/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Baked Eggs in Tomato Sauce with Kale&lt;/a&gt;. Now and then, swap your burger or taco with a vegetarian version, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250670/quinoa-veggie-burger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Quinoa Veggie Burger&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8043180/vegetarian-tacos/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Best Vegetarian Tacos&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re ready to jump in for more of a full-immersion experience and want to be sure you’re getting plenty of plant-based protein, try any of our high-protein plant-based meal plans, including this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826129/plant-based-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weeklong plan for beginners&lt;/a&gt; or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-8777942" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;30-day plan for healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most of our recipes and meal plans stay away from ultra-processed plant-based “meats,” like those that mimic the taste and texture of animal proteins like burgers, bacon and hot dogs. Ultra-processed meat, whether from animal or plant sources, usually isn’t the best choice for your health. For example, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993257/is-plant-based-meat-healthy-heres-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;evidence that eating plant-based meat products&lt;/a&gt; can increase your intake of calories, fat, sugar and salt, and that those who regularly rely on these products may end up with deficiencies in key nutrients, including calcium, potassium, magnesium, zinc and vitamin B12. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you eat is just one piece of the longevity puzzle. Plenty of habits contribute to better health, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/i-tried-eating-the-doctor-recommended-30-plant-based-foods-a-week-8763777" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating a diverse diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-no-added-sugar-snacks-for-blood-sugar-8710202" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;limiting added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;exercising regularly&lt;/a&gt;, prioritizing sleep and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-immune-system-study-8772697" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;spending time with loved ones&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that while animal-based protein may have advantages during infancy and childhood, plant-based protein has a more positive influence later in life and may help you live longer. Eating more plant-based foods has many health advantages, including a reduced risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t have to become vegan or vegetarian to enjoy the benefits that eating more plants has to offer. Start with just one snack a day or one meal a week, and gradually go up from there. Look for easy, creative ways to add plant proteins to foods you already eat—add a handful of walnuts and chia seeds to your oatmeal, make a veggie sandwich with cheese and hummus spread on whole-grain bread or swap out the meat in your soup for protein-rich beans. Before long, you’ll realize that plants have become a regular part of your meal pattern.&lt;br&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bad habits like smoking, heavy drinking and lack of exercise start taking their toll at the age of 36, researchers have claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ditching unhealthy vices early in life was found to boost the odds of having a happy and healthy old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers tracked the health of hundreds of children born in 1959 until they were 61 and found those who consistently smoked, boozed and lounged around in their younger years ended up sicker and more depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crucially, their health started to decline at the age of 36.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings highlight the importance of tackling risky health behaviours as early as possible to prevent damage from building up over the years,' said Dr Tiia Kekäläinen, of Laurea University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/finland/index.html" id="mol-9bd9e3a0-2125-11f0-b4ba-89b0fb9ed748"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bad habits in youth culminate in poor mental and physical health later in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Heart disease and cancer cause almost three-quarters of deaths worldwide. But by following a healthy lifestyle, an individual can cut their risk of developing these illnesses and reduce their odds of an early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is never too late to change to healthier habits. Adopting healthier habits in midlife also has benefits for older age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Health problems caused by poor lifestyle choices start to kick in at 36, researchers found&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lack of exercise was particularly linked to poor physical health, smoking was mainly linked to poor mental health and heavy alcohol consumption was associated with declines in both mental and physical health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The impact was greater for those who indulged in unhealthy habits over longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking causes lung cancer and heart and breathing problems, while a lack of exercise and too much alcohol may cause issues such as organ failure, cancer, stroke, heart attack and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has focused on how bad habits affect people during middle age. The new study, published in Annals of Medicine, followed people from a much younger age to work out when the rot sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers pointed out that bad habits and ill health are probably two-way — depression and physical problems may lead to drinking, smoking and immobility, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added the results are most applicable to people born in the late 1950s and early 60s. However, they may not be as relevant to younger generations, who may have different lifestyles and risky habits, such as vaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other lifestyle factors that can have major health impacts, such as diet and drug use, were also not considered as factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Mono County &lt;a href="https://monohealth.com/environmental-health/page/hantavirus-0" data-link="native" class=""&gt;has urged residents&lt;/a&gt; to seal their homes to prevent rodent infestations and refrain from vacuuming or sweeping mouse droppings because it could stir up particles into the air and increase risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boo, the county health officer, said in an April news release that authorities don’t have a “clear sense” of where Becerra or the other two people who died this year contracted the virus, but also said that they “may have been exposed during normal daily activities, either in the home or the workplace.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mammoth Mountain Inn is located a few hundred years away from the ski resort’s lifts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lester Black/SFGATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becerra worked for the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area and lived in employee housing, according to a coroner’s report obtained by SFGATE via a public records request. Those details have not been previously reported.

Built in 1958, the Mammoth Mountain Inn is adjacent to the ski area’s Main Lodge and is part of a site that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.townofmammothlakes.ca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/12581/20-030-MML-NOP-Project-Summary_20221017-final-binder" data-link="native" class=""&gt;targeted for redevelopment&lt;/a&gt; by the ski area and Mammoth Lakes’ Town Council. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very small amount of rodent droppings were found in the bell area and behind the front desk, very near the front entrance at Mammoth Mountain Inn (MMI).

Those cleanings have either already taken place or will shortly and will continue to take place as needed, more out of an abundance of caution than in response to evidence of activity.” He did not share the name of the contractor in charge of this cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mammoth Inn was built in 1958 near the Mammoth Ski Area’s main base area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lester Black/SFGATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus outbreaks can sometimes lead to drastic action.

Because of its rarity, doctors &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/hantavirus-questions-answered" data-link="native" class=""&gt;do not fully understand&lt;/a&gt; how the syndrome progresses, but the syndrome starts with flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches and dry cough, and then can rapidly progress to lung tissue damage, lung fluid buildup and even heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mammoth Mountain Ski Resort, pictured here in 2024, is in the rugged Eastern Sierra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lester Black/SFGATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coroner’s report does not specifically say Rodrigo Becerra had hantavirus pulmonary syndrome; it notes the cause of death is “pending pathology and toxicology.” The news release from Mono County about the three hantavirus-related deaths says the county public health department confirmed “a third death due to Hantavirus ... a serious and often fatal illness.” Hantavirus is a group of viruses that can cause two illnesses: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The pulmonary syndrome is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/about/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;primary disease&lt;/a&gt; caused by the virus in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariela Becerra said her family is upset that doctors at the local hospital discharged her brother so quickly without any further care, given his severe symptoms.

You remove the fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of people don't know this because what happens when you remove the fat from yogurt, the whole thing collapses... it doesn't have a mouth feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So you know what the manufacturers do? They put additives [and] emulsifiers [in the yogurt] to build back that thick mouth feel of rich yogurt.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li's concerns are mostly theoretical - there is little direct evidence showing yoghurt causes cancer and some actually show it may reduce the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet the health expert points to the use of thickening agents such as carrageenan as concerning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr William Li, whose book Eat to Beat Your Diet is a New York Times bestseller, says that the worst offending yogurts are actually the low-fat varieties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ingreident also used in other processed dairy products including creamers, chocolate milk, ice cream, cottage cheese, and sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it originates naturally from seaweed, the version used in food manufacturing is heavily processed, making it essentially a synthetic ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li reveals that it has recently come to light that manmade carrageenan can cause gut inflammation, which is a significant risk factor for developing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another thickening agent that the dietician warns about is polysorbate 80. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 study from researchers at the University of Paris that fed mice emulsifiers like polysorbate 80 found consuming the products regularly led to increased gut inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic inflammation can increase the risk for cancer by damaging DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, they suggested, could put the body at greater risk for developing colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A different study in 2021 found introducing emulsifiers to a colony of bacteria that mimicked the kind found in the human gut caused some of the bacteria to die off or become unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested the bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract play an important role in fighting back against cancer - and that disrupting it could make colorectal cancers more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024 University of Miami Gastroenterologist Dr Maria Abreu, who studies the affect of food additives and their link to colon cancer, likewise said that the affect of emulsifiers on the microbiome could be contributing to the number of young people getting cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separate 2022 research from the French Nutrition and Cancer Research Network studied more than 102,000 adults and estimated their exposure to different food additives over a day by asking them about their diet habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then tracked them over ten years, and found that those who were estimated to consume higher amounts of certain emulsifiers were more likely to develop breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In light of these findings, Dr Li highlights the importance of checking the ingredients before purchasing a product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He highlights that full-fat dairy goods are usually free of thickening agents and better for your health that low-fat alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also says plain dairy goods are traditionally better than flavored products, as they tend to contain chemicals and more sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Whole Greek yogurt is processed [but] the moment you add that layer of blueberry jam or whatever... ultra-sweetened stuff, added sugar stuff, now it's ultra-processed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Li warns of yogurt's hidden dangers, other experts praise it as a superfood and say that it can actually safeguard against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, doctors from Harvard University found that people who eat at least two servings of yogurt a week could lower their risk of colon cancers caused by bacteria by 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers looked at colon cancer tumors caused by Bifidobacterium, a type of bacteria that normally helps digest fiber and ward off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, excess levels can lead to inflammation in the colon, which damages cells and causes them to grow out of control, resulting in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe healthy bacteria, including Bifidobacterium, found in fermented foods like yogurt can reduce the amount of harmful bacteria living in the gut, reducing the risk of bacteria-fueled colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Li says one of the worst offending thickening agents is carrageenan, which is also used in other processed dairy products including creamers, chocolate milk, ice cream, cottage cheese, and sour cream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they found no link between yogurt and reduced risk of colon cancers caused by other factors such as genes, obesity and chemical exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Li's focus it more on yogurts that have been ultra-processed as opposed to chemical-free yogurts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that more than 70 percent of calories consumed by children and adolescents in the US come from ultra-processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This compares to around 30 percent three decades ago.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A CDC study states that ultra-processed foods are 'formulations of macronutrients (starches, sugars, fats, and protein isolates) with little, if any, whole food and often with added flavors, colors, emulsifiers, and other cosmetic additives'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Examples of ultra-processed foods given include soft drinks, packaged salty snacks, cookies and cakes, processed meats, chicken nuggets, and powdered and packaged instant soups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they can also include some healthier options such as wholegrain breakfast cereals, wholemeal bread, canned beans and tofu, which are softer and more palatable compared to pure ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultra-processed foods are typically energy-dense products, high in calories, added sugar, unhealthy fats, and salt, and low in dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The level of consumption is generally high in high-income countries where the products are more accessible but it is increasing in low-and middle-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that high intake of ultra-processed foods is associated with a range of health problems including obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 20:27:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPTkJfX2FVV1BGM1pjbnRKZ1RDRjBFMmVjMXNMSTRlYmtJZl9zZEd0RHplWW1IeWtxN3lTRlRQU2hpMjlwTWFXQjNNRThwdDJMckltMDFYTk00Z2dPMEUwbi1zYVQ0ejA1MGJEODcwRExLQ3Y1XzdDUS1YMXFWX1pKMzh3QnNoRms1RFJOVVliaXhJVFc1TldUeGdKNV9XRmlkaVJIUW5ZWQ</guid></item><item><title>催产素通过平行脑回路激发利他反应-神经科学新闻 | Oxytocin Powers Altruistic Responses via Parallel Brain Circuits - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9talg4Z2ZibHdiSVQ4VWFvcTRHVlgtMnhTSi0taDVZWWZBSE5Td0d4SEM2dnFkbVFoUFV4bkxRczZBSDk1d2tlQklIT0czbTJZQVQxR3N1RlZpMFpGdF9MbENOT25oUDRFNGhnY1lR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that mice instinctively display rescue-like behaviors toward anesthetized peers, offering powerful evidence that prosociality may be hardwired in mammals. Researchers identified oxytocin as a key driver, activating two brain pathways to coordinate emotional and motor responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One path processes emotional distress, while the other initiates helping behaviors like licking and grooming. These findings challenge the belief that altruism is limited to more cognitively advanced species and open new doors to studying the neurobiology of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instinctive Help:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice licked and groomed anesthetized peers without prior training or rewards.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Brain Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Oxytocin activated circuits in the amygdala and stria terminalis to drive emotional and motor components of helping behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutual Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Helping behaviors reduced both the observer’s stress and accelerated the peer’s recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese Academy of Sciences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a new study, researchers have found that mice can instinctively exhibit rescue-like behavior toward anesthetized conspecifics, without any prior training or external rewards. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, offers compelling evidence that prosocial behavior may be deeply rooted in biology, extending even to small mammals like mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. HU Li from the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Dr. CHEN Zhoufeng from Washington University School of Medicine and the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation, the study uncovers the molecular and neural mechanisms that drive this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings suggest a conserved evolutionary basis for prosociality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although altruistic behaviors—such as helping distressed peers—have been well documented in animals like elephants, dogs, and even ants, the presence of such tendencies in rodents has remained controversial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study provides robust evidence of such behaviors in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiments, an “observer” mouse placed with an anesthetized peer showed clear signs of stress, indicated by elevated blood corticosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the observer mouse engaged in allogrooming and allolicking—behaviors that not only accelerated the recovery of the anesthetized mouse but also alleviated the observer’s own stress, suggesting a mutually beneficial dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the underlying mechanisms, the researchers used a combination of advanced tools, including transgenic mice, chemogenetics, optogenetics, and fiber photometry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that oxytocin (OXT) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are activated when the observer mouse detects distress signals from a peer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurons release OXT, which then acts on two parallel pathways via the oxytocin receptor to coordinate emotional and motor components of the rescue-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the pathway through the central amygdala is responsible for decoding the negative emotional valence of the distress signal, while the pathway through the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis enables the execution of rescue-like behaviors such as licking and grooming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin, often referred to as the “prosocial hormone,” is known to promote empathy, trust, and cooperative behaviors in both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to demonstrate that oxytocin can coordinate both emotional responses and motor actions through a dual-pathway mechanism to facilitate efficient and timely rescue-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than a century, the origins and evolutionary significance of altruism have intrigued philosophers, psychologists, and evolutionary biologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing the neural circuits and molecular players involved in instinctive helping behavior in mice, this study not only challenges previous assumptions but also introduces a novel paradigm for exploring the biological foundations of empathy and social connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, it lays a foundation for future research into the neurobiology of complex social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About this oxytocin and altruism research news&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:

rescue-like behavior in mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous rescue behavior enhances the well-being and survival of social animals, yet the neural mechanisms underlying the recognition and response to conspecifics in need remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that observer mice experience distress when encountering anesthetized conspecifics, prompting spontaneous rescue-like behavior toward the unconscious mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This behavior facilitates the earlier awakening of anesthetized mice while simultaneously alleviating stress in the helper mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal that endogenous oxytocin (OXT) release from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) regulates the emotional component of rescue-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, OXT release from the PVN to OXTR in the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (dBNST) mediates the motor component of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we demonstrate that these two pathways exhibited distinct temporal dynamics and functional roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OXT&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt;-OXTR&lt;sup&gt;CeA&lt;/sup&gt; pathway is activated in a transient and intense manner, acting as a trigger for rescue-like behavior, whereas the OXT&lt;sup&gt;PVN&lt;/sup&gt;-OXTR&lt;sup&gt;dBNST&lt;/sup&gt; pathway responds in a sustained manner, ensuring the continuation of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the remarkable ability of rodents to engage in targeted helping behavior and suggest that distinct subcortical oxytocinergic pathways selectively and synergistically regulate the motor and emotional aspects of rescue-like behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr

data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, the conventional wisdom has been to swap out red meat for white meats like chicken and poultry to help reduce health risks like increased cholesterol, cancer, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/foods-that-cause-inflammation" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;—not to mention get a more budget-friendly protein source. But a new study links eating chicken and other poultry with a significantly increased risk of dying from gastrointestinal cancer and all other causes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But before you put down the chicken—or roll your eyes and get back to your chicken Caesar—check out the details of the study, and what a dietitian says you should do if you're concerned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-about-the-dietary-studyand-its-findings"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; About the Dietary Study—and Its Findings &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;, followed 4,869 people based in southern Italy who are part of large long-term cohort studies and agreed to fill out dietary and lifestyle surveys. During the study period, which ran from 2006 until 2024, they shared information about their meat consumption, divided into red and white meats, and researchers tracked the cause of death of participants who passed away.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that those who ate more than 300 grams (a little more than 10 ounces) of poultry per week had a 27% higher risk of dying than those who ate less than 100 grams (about 3.5 ounces) of chicken or poultry per week. The risk increased even more for those who ate well above that 300 gram range, and was for all causes of death, including cancers and cardiovascular disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The people who ate more than 300 grams of white meat per week also more than doubled their risk of dying from gastrointestinal cancers, compared to those who ate less than 100 grams.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study does seem to conflict with previous studies, which found that eating white meat instead of red meat was more protective against gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And there are limitations to this kind of study, says Theresa Gentile, MS, RD, CDN, spokesperson for the &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/a&gt;. "This study found an association, not a direct cause, between higher poultry intake and increased mortality, especially from gastrointestinal cancers. It doesn't mean poultry causes cancer."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And lifestyle-based studies like this can have a lot of potentially confounding factors that could account for some of this discrepancy, including:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; The cooking method and processing of the chicken could have an impact on how healthy it is &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "There is lack of data on the cooking method of the chicken," Gentile says. "Chicken cooked at high temperatures, like grilling, barbecuing, or frying, can create heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are compounds known to increase cancer risk."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If the chicken was highly processed, that could have an impact as well. "Even though the study participants were following a Mediterranean diet, it's very possible some of the chicken eaten was processed, which is high in sodium, preservatives, and saturated fats, which are linked to worse health outcomes."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Study subjects are self-reporting their diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is a common issue for long-term studies, as having researchers clock every meal thousands of participants eat for decades is obviously not going to happen. But it can affect the accuracy of these types of studies. "This study included a large number of participants over a long period of time, but self-reported diets can be inaccurate as people often underreport or under or overestimate," Gentile says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Other health factors weren't assessed in the study &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While blood pressure and some other metrics were part of the assessment, other things that have a big impact on someone's health weren't. "Physical activity wasn't documented in the study, which is a protector against all-cause mortality," Gentile says. "Other dietary factors weren't taken into consideration—even though participants generally followed a Mediterranean diet, men were more likely to consume larger portions, more meat than women, more alcohol, and less fruits and vegetables."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-you-stop-eating-chicken"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Should You Stop Eating Chicken? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The answer to this question isn't quite so simple—and Gentile says it would be hasty to stop eating chicken altogether. "This study doesn't prove that poultry is inherently harmful, but that certain patterns of eating may be linked to higher mortality, especially in older men who eat more than 10 to 11 ounces per week," Gentile says. "The average person eating a few servings of chicken per week, alongside a Mediterranean diet, doesn't need to panic, although we should always be thoughtful." Here's what Gentile suggests:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Opt for pasture-raised or organic chicken &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Organic or pasture-raised chicken may have less inflammatory and less questionable feed ingredients," Gentile says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Avoid processed chicken products &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Put down the chicken nuggets! Look for fresh cuts of chicken, rather than nuggets, patties, or deli meats.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Choose lower heat cooking methods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I's important not to char, BBQ, deep-fry, or griddle chicken at high heat to reduce the formation of cancer-causing compounds," Gentile says. Consider baking or braising instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Swing toward plant-based proteins or seafood &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're looking to reduce your meat intake, swap in more &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-plant-based-foods-nutrition-experts-always-recommend-11680448" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt; and seafood to take their place—and pair it with plenty of vegetables for a healthier diet. "Plant-based proteins are high in fiber, phytochemicals, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/antioxidant-foods" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; and help prevent against chronic diseases," Gentile says.

Worried, she visited her doctor, who dismissed her concerns as changes that can occur after having a baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In their words, not mine, I presented as if I had it together as if I was an energetic young mom who perhaps may have had different expectations of the physical, emotional ramifications of having a child,” Peters, now 43, of Los Angeles, tells TODAY.com. “Some of my physicians chalked it up to being related to childbirth, which ultimately delayed my diagnosis.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Over the next five years, the symptoms continued, and doctors assured Peters she was fine. She delivered two more children before finally undergoing a colonoscopy and ultimately being diagnosed with Stage 3 rectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Life immediately turned upside down overnight as it does for anybody when they get life (changing) news like that,” she says. “Cancer had been the furthest thing from my mind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Increasing symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At first, Peters noticed blood on the toilet paper. As the years passed, the symptoms became more concerning.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It went from ribbons of blood in the poop to filling the bowl with blood,” she says. “It ultimately seemed like (I) had a period with the amount of blood that was coming out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The texture of her stool changed, and it looked “shaggy” and smaller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-04-848cf6.jpg" alt="Since her diagnosis with Stage 3 rectal cancer, Marisa Peters shares her story to raise awareness of the cancer.

After her third child’s “complicated” birth that included her rapidly losing blood, she eventually saw a gastroenterologist to approve a medication that she hoped would help manage her GI symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I went to that doctor and on telling her my symptoms, I’ll never forget her face. She was shocked and concerned,” Peters recalls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The doctor asked if Peters wanted a colonoscopy and at first, she demurred. At the time, she didn’t know that &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/news/colon-cancer-top-cause-death-young-people-rcna134218" target="_blank"&gt;colorectal cancer rates in young people were increasing&lt;/a&gt;. The doctor agreed they could skip the colonoscopy for now if Peters underwent other types of tests. If those results indicated a colonoscopy was needed, Peters agreed to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We did a Cologuard test. We did a number of other lab-based tests,” she says. “Sure enough, the Cologuard test resulted positive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Peters needed a colonoscopy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I got that colonoscopy, which revealed the tumor,” she says. “They got the biopsy back very quickly, so within 48 hours. It was a Wednesday that I got the call that it was confirmed cancerous.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The size of the tumor indicated it was late stage but doctors were unsure if it had spread to other parts of her body or invaded the rectal wall. Soon after undergoing scans, Peters learned she had Stage 3 rectal cancer in early summer 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The tumor was right at the top of my rectum, which was why it was causing that increased urgency to go to the bathroom,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her treatment plan included six rounds of chemotherapy followed by 28 rounds of radiation with oral chemotherapy every week day for five and a half weeks. Following treatment, she underwent a 7-hour surgery where doctors removed the mass and reconstructed her rectum. To recover, she had an&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/woman-rectal-cancer-35-details-signs-comic-rcna197951?search=ilestomy" target="_blank"&gt; ileostomy&lt;/a&gt; for four months. Finally, she had six more rounds of chemotherapy before undergoing the surgery to reverse the ileostomy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That is when I feel like the real battle started because you realize what has gone on in your life,” she says. “Thankfully, gratefully, miraculously I had a complete response to treatment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Colorectal cancer in young people &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Over the past 30 years, the number of cases of colorectal cancer in young people has steadily risen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It is definitely increasing in young people,” Dr. David Rosen, a colorectal surgeon with the Center for Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer, who did not treat Peters, told &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/dad-35-blood-stool-1st-sign-colorectal-cancer-rcna194673" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. “It continues to increase in young people even younger than 45.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-03-a9ef9e.jpg" alt="Since Marisa Peters was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a younger age, her children will need to start screening earlier than most people."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since Marisa Peters was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a younger age, her children will need to start screening earlier than most people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Marisa Peters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Signs of colorectal cancer can include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloody stool &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bleeding from the rectum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different bowel habits &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain or pressure in the rectum&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changes to the quality of stool, such as being narrow or loose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexpected weight loss &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Abdominal cramps &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Treatments for rectal cancer can include chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;'Never going to stop sharing'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After her diagnosis and the completion of her treatment, Peters started a nonprofit called &lt;a href="https://beseen.care/" target="_blank"&gt;Be Seen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Our mission is to eradicate death by young onset colorectal cancer through three pillars. (One) that is focused in awareness and education. Again, that would have made a critical difference if I only knew,” she says. “The second is around access and research … And lastly, it’s not enough if people just know they have the tests, they have to take action. They need to get those colonoscopies or take a stool-based test.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After her own experience, Peters feels it’s important to share information about colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/mom-rectal-cancer-zz-250424-01-3e8dc6.jpg" alt="Raising awareness of colorectal cancer has become a family affair for Marisa Peters, her husband and three sons.

When liver function is impaired and ketone levels drop, memory and learning typically suffer—but physical activity can still counteract those effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests exercise triggers alternative brain-supporting mechanisms beyond just energy supply. With Alzheimer’s rates rising, these findings point to physical activity as a powerful tool for preserving brain health, especially in individuals with metabolic or liver-related challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ketones &amp;amp; Brain Health:&lt;/strong&gt; Ketones fuel memory and cognition when glucose is low.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity improved brain function even without ketone support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may help people with liver conditions at higher dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know exercise is good for our body, but what about our brains? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the University of Missouri suggests that exercise plays a crucial role in keeping our minds sharp, even when one of the brain’s key energy sources isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Mizzou researchers Taylor Kelty and R. Scott Rector, offers fresh insight into brain health and suggests that exercise could play a bigger role in preventing cognitive decline than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109095"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and weights." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/exercise-cognition-energy-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When the body runs low on its usual fuel — glucose — the liver makes ketones, an alternative energy source that helps power the brain.  Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the number of Americans expected to develop Alzheimer’s disease more than doubling by 2060, this research raises an intriguing possibility: Could regular physical activity be the key to preserving memory and cognitive performance as we age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body runs low on its usual fuel — glucose — the liver makes ketones, an alternative energy source that helps power the brain. These molecules support cognitive memory, learning and overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens when the liver can’t produce enough of them? Can exercise help compensate for this ketone deficiency?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelty and Rector, the director of the Roy Blunt NextGen Precision Health building, were determined to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers looked at what happens when ketone production is limited in the liver. As expected, the result was a noticeable decline in brain function and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, something remarkable happened: Exercise still managed to help reverse some of the cognitive decline, even with the ketone production impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going into the study, we thought that with fewer ketones and the cognitive impairments that causes, exercise may not be able to overcome that impairment,” Kelty, a postdoctoral fellow in Rector’s lab, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it seems like exercise is so powerful that there are other mechanisms going on in the brain that allow it circumvent those impairments and still receive the benefits from exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rector, who is also a professor in the School of Medicine, emphasized the complexity of exercise’s effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study highlights how exercise benefits the body in a multitude of ways, even when we don’t fully understand all the molecular mechanisms involved,” Rector said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even when we remove a single pathway, exercise is doing so many other things that it can help mitigate those deficiencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are especially promising for people with liver conditions that prevent the body from making ketones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelty pointed out that the emerging field of liver-brain research is beginning to show that individuals with severe liver dysfunction have a higher risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If ketone production in the liver is disrupted, it could be a potential cause of cognitive decline, ultimately leading to conditions like dementia,” Kelty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this research helps raise awareness about the importance of ketone production on brain health and the impact exercise can have on staying mentally sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much we’re still uncovering, and with all the state-of-the-art resources and interdisciplinary collaborations at Mizzou, it’s exciting to think about where this research might take us next,” Kelty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise could be a key piece of the puzzle in preserving brain health as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than two decades at Mizzou, Rector said he’s proud to be part of a community that makes research like this possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The support we’ve received from Mizzou, the Division of Research, Innovation and Impact, and the NextGen Precision Health initiative has been incredible,” Rector said. “We hope our work will ultimately help a lot of people in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Cognitive impairment caused by compromised hepatic ketogenesis is prevented by endurance exercise” was published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and is a part of the NIH Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC), a national research consortium designed to discover the molecular mechanisms of how physical activity improves health and prevents disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#94f7fbfae7fdf3f8fdfbf6d4f9fde7e7fbe1e6fdbaf1f0e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brian Consiglio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://missouri.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Brian Consiglio – University of Missouri-Columbia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1113/JP287573" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive impairment caused by compromised hepatic ketogenesis is prevented by endurance exercise&lt;/a&gt;” by Taylor Kelty et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Physiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive impairment caused by compromised hepatic ketogenesis is prevented by endurance exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensive research has demonstrated endurance exercise to be neuroprotective. Whether these neuroprotective benefits are mediated, in part, by hepatic ketone production remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the role of hepatic ketone production on brain health during exercise, healthy 6-month-old female rats underwent viral knockdown of the rate-limiting enzyme in the liver that catalyses the first reaction in ketogenesis: 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGCS2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats were then subjected to either a bout of acute exercise or 4 weeks of chronic treadmill running (5 days/week) and cognitive behavioural testing. Acute exercise elevated ketone plasma concentration 1 h following exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatic HMGCS2 knockdown, verified by protein expression, reduced ketone plasma concentration 1 h after acute exercise and 48 h after chronic exercise. Proteomic analysis and enrichment of the frontal cortex revealed hepatic HMGCS2 knockdown reduced markers of mitochondrial function 1 h after acute exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HMGCS2 knockdown significantly reduced state 3 complex I + II respiration in isolated mitochondria from the frontal cortex after chronic exercise. Spatial memory and protein markers of synaptic plasticity were significantly reduced by HMGCS2 knockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These deficiencies were prevented by chronic endurance exercise training. In summary, these are the first data to propose that hepatic ketogenesis is required to maintain cognition and mitochondrial function, irrespective of training status, and that endurance exercise can overcome neuropathology caused by insufficient hepatic ketogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results establish a mechanistic link between liver and brain health that enhance our understanding of how peripheral tissue metabolism influences brain health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 18:31:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5ZUXg3OUwxcEtXb21SUmpZZ2l2TVEydEpKSXUxMHNWMlJVOW0yMm1veHZGYUp0bjFpakV1UnVPR3dCTUh6TlhPSG9hYVVLWjd6ZFhjNnh2WXdqY1BWWWVkR016ZHFoSTVyYVBQTVFn</guid></item><item><title>阻断令人惊讶的免疫主调节因子可根除小鼠肝肿瘤- Medical Xpress | Blocking a surprising master regulator of immunity eradicates liver tumors in mice - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxOQjhZZldJX1g4d3NCek05bTVvOWZUR0lNbG5BZ1pNTXhJVDl6OWRTdFZTWkxXNlVRUjJXeHFWdGRrNWNrN2NWS0RlX04zeEp4ZFBGQS1tc3lZOWxQRUtGY1RUWnlKSlE5cDdYQXRnN0pFMEhFWFhHN2JURGNPUE5zQ0hGZlRFSFg2dm9hWFBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Blocking the activity of the protein turns formerly "cold," or immune-resistant, liver tumors in mice into "hot" tumors teeming with cancer-fighting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;. When combined with an immunotherapy that further activates these immune cells against the cancer, the treatment led to complete regression of existing liver tumors in most mice. Treated animals lived for the duration of the experiment. In contrast, control animals survived only a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a fundamental breakthrough in our understanding of how the immune system is turned off and on in cancer," said Edgar Engleman, MD, Ph.D., a professor of pathology and of medicine. "I could not be more excited about this discovery, and I hope treatments that target the mechanism we uncovered will quickly move forward to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human trials&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engleman is the senior author of the research, which was &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr3026" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; online in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;. Basic life research scientist David Kung-Chun Chiu, Ph.D., is the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Likely applicable to many cancers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the work was completed in mice, there are strong indications that the protein, erythropoietin or EPO, plays a similar role in many types of human cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Research from more than a decade ago has shown that giving EPO to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; with anemia to stimulate red blood cell formation accelerates the growth of the tumor," Engleman said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The connection was so striking that in 2007 the Food and Drug Administration required a black box warning label on the drug cautioning against its use in people with cancers. Researchers also saw a clear correlation between patient prognosis and the levels of naturally occurring EPO and its receptor in the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those old reports showed clearly that the more EPO or EPOR there was in tumors, the worse off the patients were," Engleman said. "But the connection between EPO and cancer immunity was never made until now. In fact, it took a long time and a lot of experiments to convince us that EPO plays a fundamental role in blocking the immune response to cancer, because EPO is so well established as a red blood cell growth factor."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiu developed and studied genome editing techniques to create several mouse models of liver cancer to study how liver tumors develop and respond to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each model recapitulates specific mutations, histology and the response to approved therapies found in subtypes of human liver cancers. Tumor formation was either induced by injecting a combination of DNA-encoding proteins associated with liver cancer into the animals' tail vein or by implanting liver cancer cells into the animals' livers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were interested in the effect on cancer growth of a common immunotherapy targeting a molecule called PD-1 on immune cells called T cells. Binding to PD-1 blocks the ability of cancer cells to dampen the activity of T cells. Anti-PD-1 therapies, including one marketed commercially as Keytruda, are routinely used to treat many types of human cancers, including melanoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma and some types of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In some cases, they have transformed patient outcomes. But a large majority of tumors, including most liver, pancreas, colon, breast and prostate cancers are resistant to the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, similar to what has been observed in human liver cancers, some combinations of mutations led to the development of liver tumors that were largely ignored by the immune system, rendering them immune privileged, or cold. These tumors did not shrink when the animals were treated with anti-PD-1 because few T cells were present in the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the cold tumors, other mutations led to hot or "inflamed" tumors replete with T cells. These tumors were highly sensitive to anti-PD1 treatment, which triggered the T cells to attack the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, the cold tumors displayed elevated levels of EPO when compared with hot tumors. This increase is likely caused by the oxygen-poor microenvironment—a condition called hypoxia—prevalent in cold tumors. Hypoxia induces the production of proteins in cancer cells that, in turn, ramp up the production of EPO to create more red blood cells to combat low oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hypoxia in tumors has been studied for decades," Engleman said. "It just didn't dawn on anyone, including me, that EPO could be doing anything in this context other than serving as a red blood cell growth factor."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious, the researchers turned to existing databases to confirm that elevated levels of EPO are correlated with poorer survival of people with cancers of the liver, kidney, breast, colon and skin. They then tinkered with the ability of the tumor cells to make EPO and were surprised at what happened in the animals' liver tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;They found that mutations that had led to the development of cold tumors instead caused hot tumors when the tumors were modified to be unable to make EPO. Conversely, hot tumors that had previously been successfully eradicated by the immune system thrived when they were engineered to make elevated levels of EPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further exhaustive research showed that, in cold tumors, the tumor cells make and secrete EPO, which binds to receptors on the surface of immune cells called macrophages. The macrophages then switch to an immunosuppressive role, shooing away cancer-killing T cells and tamping down their activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of this EPO-moderated crosstalk between tumor cells and macrophages showed clearly when the researchers studied the combinatorial effect of simultaneously blocking the EPO signaling pathway and anti-PD-1 pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those experiments, no mice with cold &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/liver+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;liver tumors&lt;/a&gt; that were treated with control or with anti-PD-1 lived more than eight weeks after tumor induction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, 40% of mice with macrophages unable to make the EPO receptor lived for 18 weeks after tumor induction, when the experiment was terminated. When anti-PD-1 treatment was given to mice lacking the EPO receptor, all animals lived for the duration of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's simple," Engleman said. "If you remove this EPO signaling, either by lowering the hormone levels or by blocking the receptors on the macrophages, you don't just get a reduction in tumor growth, you get tumor regression along with sensitivity to anti-PD-1treatment."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Engleman and his colleagues are now designing treatments targeting EPO signaling in human cancers. Non-specifically targeting the EPO protein could cause anemia, which Engleman speculates might be an acceptable trade-off for an effective cancer therapy. An alternative approach is to selectively block the EPO receptors on the surfaces of macrophages in the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I continue to be amazed by this finding," Engleman said. "Not every tumor is going to respond in the same way, but I'm very optimistic that this discovery will lead to powerful new cancer therapies."&lt;/p&gt;

However, new research suggests it’s a distinct mental state linked to physiological arousal levels, with its own brain and body signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mind blanks are common during prolonged attention, sleep deprivation, or physical fatigue, and involve disruptions in memory, attention, and language. By studying neural patterns during blank moments, scientists hope to better understand both everyday cognitive lapses and clinical conditions like anxiety, ADHD, and brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequent Phenomenon:&lt;/strong&gt; People experience mind blanking about 5–20% of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiological Clues:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s associated with decreased heart rate, slower brainwaves, and local sleep states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Mind blanking appears in anxiety, ADHD, brain injury, and sleep disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cell Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind blanking is a common experience with a wide variety of definitions ranging from feeling “drowsy” to “a complete absence of conscious awareness.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an opinion article publishing April 24 in the Cell Press journal &lt;em&gt;Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, a team of neuroscientists and philosophers compiles what we know about mind blanking, including insights from their own work observing people’s brain activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During wakefulness, our thoughts transition between different contents. However, there are moments that are seemingly devoid of reportable content, referred to as mind blanking,” writes the research team, which formed as a result of collaboration at the 25th Annual Meeting of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness in Amsterdam in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It remains unclear what these blanks represent, highlighting the definitional and phenomenological ambiguities surrounding mind blanking.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, mind blanking has only been studied using research and experiments developed to study mind wandering—a similar internal experience in which our thoughts “flow seamlessly like a stream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that mind blanking is a distinct experience that involves feeling sleepier, more sluggish, and making more errors, and should be inspired by mind wandering research, but considered independently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sought to better understand mind blanking by parsing through 80 relevant research articles—including some of our own in which we recorded participants’ brain activity when they were reporting that they were ‘thinking of nothing,’” explains author Athena Demertzi of GIGA Research at University of Liège, Belgium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways from their research include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mind blank frequency varies greatly between different people, but a person experiences the phenomenon about 5%–20% of the time on average. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common experiences defined as “mind blanking” include lapses of attention, memory issues, and a cessation of inner speech, among others. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mind blanks tend to happen toward the end of long, sustained attention tasks like exams and after sleep deprivation or intense physical exercise, but are also a typical waking state.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) report mind blanking more frequently than neurotypical people. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mind blanking is part of the clinical description of generalized anxiety disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). It is also relevant to several other clinical conditions including strokes, seizures, traumatic brain injuries, and Kleine–Levin syndrome—which causes people to sleep up to 20 hours per day. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiments observing brain activity during rest using technologies including fMRI and electroencephalography show that there are specific neural signatures in the frontal, temporal, and visual networks of the brain before a mind blank.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During mind blanks after sustained attention tasks, people’s heart rates and pupil sizes decreased and their brains showed lower signal complexity—a state typically observed in unconscious people. During the blank, they observed disruptions in sensory processing and slow, sleep-like EEG waves. The authors describe these states in which parts of a person’s brain appear asleep as “local sleep episodes.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An increase in neural activity in posterior cortical brain regions can also lead to mind blanking, as is the case when high-speed thinking leads to slower cognitive function. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When people were prompted to actively “empty their minds,” researchers observed deactivations in the inferior frontal gyrus, Broca’s area, supplementary motor cortex, and hippocampus.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the common factor between different forms of blanking may be related to changes in arousal levels, leading to a malfunction of key cognitive mechanisms such as memory, language, or attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that blanking experiences vary so greatly—both in terms of people’s subjective experiences and their neural activity—the researchers propose a framework that describes mind blanking as a dynamic group of physiologically driven experiences mediated by arousal states, or a person’s state of physiological “vigilance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they describe it, this means that when the brain is in a high- or low-arousal state, a mind blank is more likely to occur.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The experience of a ‘blank mind’ is as intimate and direct as that of bearing thoughts,” says author Jennifer Windt of Monash University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our aim here is to start a conversation and see how mind blanking relates to other seemingly similar experiences, such as meditation,” adds author Antoine Lutz of the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team hopes that acknowledging mind blanking as a distinct mental state in future research will help build toward a deeper understanding of mind blanking.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that the investigation of mind blanking is insightful, important, and timely,” says lead author Thomas Andrillon of the University of Liège.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insightful because it challenges the common conception that wakefulness involves a constant stream of thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Important because mind blanking highlights the interindividual differences in subjective experience.

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVE DAVIES, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. If you live in the United States, chances are good that you either are or know a parent whose child is being treated for ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Last year, the Centers for Disease Control reported that more than 11% of American children had been diagnosed with ADHD - a record high. For 14-year-old boys, the figure was 21%. In a recent article for The New York Times magazine, journalist Paul Tough examines how ADHD is diagnosed and treated, often with commonly prescribed stimulants, such as ritalin and adderoll. Though they're regarded as highly effective and thus very popular, he finds three decades of scientific studies have raised questions about their efficacy and safety and about the nature of ADHD itself. Some researchers think the notion that ADHD is a distinct, identifiable brain disorder may be wrong or at least oversimplified, and that treatments other than medication should be considered. Paul Tough is a contributing writer to The New York Times magazine and the author of four books - most recently, "The Inequality Machine: How College Divides Us." Paul Tough, welcome to FRESH AIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAUL TOUGH: Thank you. Great to be here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You write that in the early '90s, there were rising rates of ADHD diagnoses - about 2 million American kids in 1993, roughly two-thirds of them taking Ritalin. This provoked protests from some, particularly the Church of Scientology, you know, arguing that you're drugging our kids. You write that you didn't have to be a Scientologist to acknowledge there were legitimate questions about ADHD. What were they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: At that point, the questions were pretty basic. We didn't exactly understand what this condition was and what treatments were the right ones to use. So Ritalin - doctors could see, families could see that when kids took Ritalin, there was this - in many of them, this overnight change in their behavior. But we weren't sure why that was happening, and the diagnoses were expanding at such a great rate. There was also a question of why that was, why suddenly it had doubled in just a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: So a massive study was organized by a number of researchers. Tell us how this was put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yes. So this was the Multimodal Treatment of ADHD Study, or MTA, and a number of researchers at six sites around the United States and Canada decided that they wanted to test different treatments of ADHD. So there were stimulant medications. Specifically, at that point, it was Ritalin. But there were also behavioral interventions, so coaching, parent training. And they wanted to see, scientifically, which would work best. So they did what scientists do, which is they created this randomized controlled study. And at each site in the United States and Canada, they divided the children who were between 7 and 9, who had been diagnosed with ADHD, into different treatment groups. So some got behavioral training. Some got Ritalin, and some were just left on their own to figure out their own treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Right. The results were released in 1999. What did they show?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: That was after 14 months of treatment, and what they showed was that the most effective treatment for behavior, for symptoms, was Ritalin - that the kids who had taken Ritalin were doing significantly better than the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Over time, of course, more and more kids were diagnosed with ADHD. And you write about a guy named James Swanson who was at the University of California, Irvine, who, among others, grew uneasy about these trends in diagnosis and treatment. What was troubling them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: So there were two things that were really troubling James Swanson. And one was that that initial expansion of diagnoses from about a million kids to about 2 million kids - that made sense to him because scientists thought that about 3% was the most accurate guess of what percentage of children sort of naturally had ADHD, and 2 million was pretty close to 3%. But then it kept going up. So as the study was going on, it went up to 5%, to 6%, and he couldn't see a reason why that was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing that he found disturbing was that he and the other scientists that were running the MTA study continued after those 14 months to carefully study the children who were in the original group. And what they noticed was that the advantage that the kids in the Ritalin group had had after 14 months - it started to really fade. And by 36 months, there was no difference in the symptoms of any of the groups. The kids who had taken Ritalin weren't doing better in terms of their symptoms than the children who had been assigned to the behavioral group, and they weren't even doing better than the kids who had not been given any treatment at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You write that Swanson is now 80 years old and is troubled by the way ADHD research and treatment is going. Is there a kind of fundamental theme to his concern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. I think mostly what he's concerned by is that that original study of the 14 months got a lot of attention, and the message really went out that Ritalin works, that it's the right treatment for most kids, but that the second study - the one that found that over time, those effects fade - that it did not get the same type of attention and that it's not reflected in the way that a lot of practitioners are now treating ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And there's been a lot of research into what it actually is biologically, and has that guided treatment at all? I mean, I guess that's the question. Is there a real connection between the understanding of the biological origins of this and the way it's treated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: One of the things that's so striking in talking to scientists, including neuroscientists, who've studied this is that they say that they actually understand the biology of ADHD less than they did 20 years ago. So normally, the course of science is that as time goes on, they get a better and better understanding of what's really going on in the brains of children with a particular diagnosis. And in this case, that's just not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So 20 years ago, there was this belief that there were clear biomarkers, clear indications in the brain in terms of electrical signals or a particular gene that would predict ADHD or differences in the size and shape of certain parts of the brain that you could say, this kid has that biomarker. He does have ADHD, and this one does not. And as the last couple of decades have gone on, that belief has slowly been undermined so that now there is no clear biomarker for ADHD. And I think most neuroscientists accept that that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is such a big deal for parents. Nothing is more troubling than to see your child in pain or struggling. You have kids yourself, right? You have two sons?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: I do, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah. So you know the stakes here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: What are the - some of the things that they observe that make them so desperate for help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: ADHD can be incredibly disruptive in a child's life, in a family's life, in a classroom. When kids are having trouble sitting still, focusing, getting work done, keeping themselves organized, controlling their impulses, it makes life really difficult. And it especially makes life difficult when you are going to school. A lot of the school day, you've got to sit still. You've got to focus. There's a lot of homework. I know as a parent. And when you are struggling with impulse control, when you're struggling with attention, those things are really difficult. And I think within families, that often leads to real conflict. And so what originally starts as just a problem in one child's life turns into a problem for a whole family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And I guess one of the other things that's tricky about it as a diagnosis is that a lot of the things that you observe are also symptoms from other causes, such as, you know, injury to the head or other psychological conditions, anxiety and depression, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. So it is a very tricky disorder to diagnose for a lot of reasons. I mean, the first one is that the only way to do it is by using a symptom checklist that is in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. So there's this list of symptoms. If you have six symptoms, you officially have ADHD. If you have five, you don't. There are other criteria. It has to last for a certain amount of time. It has to exist in at least two different settings. But what makes it even more tricky is exactly what you're talking about, that there is great overlap between these symptoms and the symptoms of lots of other things, of early trauma, for instance, of anxiety, of depression. And to make it even more complicated, what the CDC has found is that there is a lot of overlap among children who are diagnosed with ADHD with other psychological problems. So about three-quarters of kids who have received an ADHD diagnosis have also received a diagnosis for another psychological disorder or a learning problem. And according to the DSM, if the symptoms of a child are better explained by another diagnosis, they shouldn't be diagnosed with ADHD. So that makes it really tricky, that there is sometimes overlap between two things, but you're only supposed to diagnose ADHD if it is the one that is causing these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: The DSM you mentioned, that's the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which guides treatment for a lot of practitioners. I guess one of the other things that's a little hard to understand about this is that two kinds of symptoms for ADHD are pretty different, right? I mean, there's inattention, not paying attention. And then there's hyperactivity and impulsivity. And they seem like pretty different behaviors. Why is it assumed that they arise from the same condition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah, I think that's another part of the complication of this diagnosis. There are some doctors who think these are two entirely separate conditions, that each should have its own listing in the DSM. And, you know, in fact, over the years, there have been lots of different sort of envelopes around ADHD. Its name has changed. The symptoms that predict it have changed. There's clearly something going on in a lot of kids who are having trouble focusing, having trouble sitting still and paying attention. But in individual children, that expresses itself in lots of different ways. And that's another real struggle, I think, for clinicians, for families who are trying to figure out, you know, there's something going on with my kid - what is it? And ADHD, I think, has become this sort of catchall diagnosis that we use to just put together a lot of kids who may in fact be quite different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, it seems kind of counterintuitive that stimulants would help with hyperactivity and impulse control, right? I mean, it seems like you're pushing it in the same direction that's the problem. What's the medical explanation for that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, I don't think we know exactly what's going on. But what studies of amphetamines, the drug at the root of the two most popular medications for ADHD, what amphetamines do is they help make whatever you're focused on seem more interesting. And so I think that then makes sense, right? If you're having impulse control, if you're distracted by everything else that's going on in the room, when you take this medication that makes whatever you're supposed to be looking at seem more interesting, it makes it easier to focus, easier to sit still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: So what are some of the nondrug treatments that are helpful in treating ADHD that people are discovering?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Scientifically, there is not yet any real data showing that there's any particular sort of parent training or behavioral techniques that makes things better, which I think is really frustrating for a lot of clinicians and a lot of parents, and I think, as a result, tends to make medication seem like a more attractive alternative. But lots of clinicians have found their own ways of working kids and with families that are just about, like, helping to create a calmer atmosphere in the classroom, a calmer atmosphere at home, you know, things as basic as, you know, Post-it notes and calendars and just ways of helping you organize your thoughts, organize your schoolwork if you're a kid in school. You know, none of those are a perfect cure, but a lot of them seem to help. And I think they're really individualistic. And, you know, a good clinician can help a family figure out the solutions or the tools, the interventions that are most helpful for that child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You read about Russell Barkley, a prominent ADHD researcher. And he has a lecture that has been viewed more than 4 million times on YouTube, right? What is his perspective of the disorder?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah, so he's written a lot about it, probably the most well-known, the most prominent doctor, scientist when it comes to popularizing our ideas about ADHD. And what he talks about in this speech is that ADHD is basically diabetes of the brain, so it's a chronic condition that you're going to have to treat for your whole life. And he tends to focus on the downsides of ADHD. He takes very seriously the real problems that can occur for kids and adults who have ADHD, including higher rates of, you know, traffic accidents, of early death, of drug addiction. And the way that he looks at ADHD is to look at it as this very much sort of black-and-white, yes or no diagnosis, like diabetes. If you've got it, you've got it. If you don't, you don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And you have to treat it because there'll be, you know, downstream effects that you really want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yes, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Paul Tough. He is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine. His recent cover story is titled "Have We Been Thinking About ADHD All Wrong?" We'll be back to talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, "PEACOCKS")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with New York Times contributing writer Paul Tough. He has a new cover story about attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and its diagnosis. It's titled "Have We Been Thinking About ADHD All Wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to talk a bit about some of the research into the nature of this disorder. In 2002, you write, there was an international consensus statement signed by 85 researchers defending the validity of the diagnosis of ADHD because there had been questions about it. What was the thrust of their letter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, the main point of that consensus statement was exactly to defend the diagnosis against critics. And so a lot of that statement is just about the basic fact that this is a real diagnosis that has real consequences. What I was drawn to in that statement was the focus on biomarkers, on particular biological signatures that could let us identify ADHD and in the process say, this is clearly a biological condition, not just a psychological one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it focused on three particular biomarkers. One was certain electrical signals in the brain that seemed different in kids with ADHD than without. The other was on genetics. There were early indications in the early 2000s that there was a specific, single gene that predicted ADHD. And the third was about the kind of physical signatures you could see in the brain on MRIs, that there were differences in the volumes and sizes of particular parts of the brain in kids who had been diagnosed with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And has that held up to further study?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: No, that part has not really held up to further study. It's become much more complicated - this search for the biomarker. And there are many scientists now who say that the search for a biomarker was just a red herring, that that's not what any scientists should be focused on. Instead, we should be focusing on the experience of kids with ADHD. So each of those three biomarkers that I mentioned have been undermined in one way or another. The study of these electrical signals, repeated studies to try to replicate that, turned up to have no result. Genetics is more complicated. There are still indications that certain combinations of genetic qualities are predictive of ADHD. But the very sort of simple and straightforward, you've got this gene, you've got ADHD, that scientists were hoping was the case 20, 25 years ago, that has proven not to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then the third is this idea that there are differences in the volume - the cortical volume, scientists say, in certain parts of the brain. And that was studied in this giant global study called the enigma study done by this consortium of neuroscientists and psychiatrists. And that similarly showed almost no difference between people with ADHD and people without. Among adults and adolescents, no difference at all. Among children, just a tiny difference in the cortical volume of certain parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You write that you found a consensus of sorts among most scientists that you spoke to about this question of whether it's a biological condition. What's the consensus?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, the consensus is that there are clearly both biological and environmental causes somehow combining to create these symptoms in kids. But beyond that, there's not much consensus. There's not a clear agreement on the relative role that environment plays and that biology plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, so much of the discussion here focuses on kids because obviously, parents are really concerned about helping their kids and helping them grow and flourish. To what extent is this a growing diagnosis among adults?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: To a huge extent. So in this article, I focused on kids for a variety of reasons. Partly because the science is more clear because scientists have been studying ADHD in kids for much longer. But as a phenomenon, as a diagnosis in the United States, it is among adults that all of the growth is happening. So the fastest growing groups for the diagnosis are people - adults in their 20s and 30s. But even adults in their 40s, 50s, 60s, all of those diagnosis rates are going up really quickly, and prescription rates are going up by a huge degree, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, it's interesting 'cause you mentioned this multimodal study earlier found that there were clear benefits to ritalin and, you know, stimulants, but that they tended to disappear after about 36 months. Do we know if that's also true of adults who take these medications?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: We don't. It just hasn't been studied to the same degree. I don't think there's reason to think that there's a different result that we would see among adults, but there hasn't been a similarly rigorous study like MTA for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is such a common issue that we all know people in - that are dealing with this. And just over the past two days, just among the producers here at FRESH AIR, I've had one producer who has a son who struggles with some of this and finds the medication very helpful. And then I had another producer whose brother, when he was in second grade, had real trouble focusing and his teachers were struggling with him 'cause he was just all over the place. And they told his mom, look, you're going to have to put him on ritalin or one of these drugs, or otherwise, he can't come to school here. And the mom said, nope, I'm not doing that. And I know it's a public school, so you have to deal with him. He ended up in front of a school psychologist who taught him chess, and they began playing chess once a week. And, at least as my friend told the story, that was a real breakthrough. I mean, he really changed his behavior, and he's gone on. He's never taken medication. He's had a productive career as an artist, an animator and lives a happy life. So, I mean, an anecdote doesn't - isn't the same thing as research, but it just seems like there are a lot of ways this can go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Absolutely. Those are great stories. And, yes, so I - and I've heard lots of stories as well, not only in my reporting, but just from friends before the article came out, and then in great numbers since the article came out. And I think what's hard for us is that when we hear two different stories like that, it's hard for us not to think, well, just one of them has to be true. But the reality is they are both absolutely true, and that different people have different experiences of this condition and of its treatment. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. And so, to me, that is what is reassuring and even exciting about this new research. By giving young people and families the message that this is not just a sort of singular biological condition that you have or you don't have. That, in fact, symptoms often fluctuate over time. That there are different sorts of treatments that work for different sorts of kids. That that gives them maybe less certainty, which can sometimes be scary. But also more of a sense of possibility that this is something that can - like the young person you're talking to, who was sort of cured by chess - that there may be ways that life can change that will really change these symptoms, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: We're going to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Paul Tough. He is a contributing writer for The New York Times magazine. His recent cover story is titled "Have We Been Thinking About ADHD All Wrong?" He'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF CHRIS THILE &amp;amp; BRAD MEHLDAU'S "INDEPENDENCE DAY")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies. We are speaking with New York Times magazine contributing writer Paul Tough. His recent cover story reported on the continued growth of diagnosis of ADHD - attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - in the United States and on research that raises questions about the common treatment for ADHD - stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall. He writes that some researchers are thinking of ADHD in a new way and considering new approaches to treatment. His article is titled "Have We Been Thinking About A.D.H.D. All Wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, it's interesting. You write that the roots of treatment for this disorder go way back to an experiment, I guess, in the 1930s by a Harvard-trained psychologist in Rhode Island, right? Tell us about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. So this is a psychiatrist named Charles Bradley who ran a home for children with psychological problems in Rhode Island. And at the time - this was in the 1930s - Benzedrine, which is a kind of amphetamine, had become this really popular drug among jazz musicians, actually, and among college students who felt like it helped them focus. It sort of amped them up in various ways. And he thought, maybe I should try this on these kids. There was nothing that was seeming to help them. So he did a very small but rigorous experiment, where he gave 30 kids a daily dose of Benzedrine. And he noticed this - in about half of them, this vast change in their behavior. So they were more placid. They were more easygoing. They could get things done. They felt better about their work. And it felt to him like this kind of miracle cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: And later, researchers followed up on this and did similar experiments. What did they find?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah, so I spoke to this NYU researcher named Xavier Castellanos who actually told me about the Charles Bradley paper and said that he sees the same things now when he first prescribes Ritalin or Adderall to kids - that overnight, there's this kind of miraculous transformation for a lot of them, that their behaviors really change. What he said was frustrating, though, was that when you look at the sort of academic results for kids, even though they are able to sit and focus more and get more seat work done, their test scores don't go up. And that, I think, has been this puzzle that doctors have been wrestling with for the past couple of decades, that at least in the short term, these medications seem to have a powerful effect for some kids on their symptoms. But over time, they don't seem to have an effect on academic achievement, at least in - measured in test scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah. There's another test that you described involving putting stuff in knapsacks. Explain this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: So I'd never heard of this test before. It's called the knapsack test. But apparently, it's pretty common in psychology and computer science. You give a kid a backpack. In this case, it's a virtual backpack. And it's just this kind of game. You give them a bunch of different things of different weights and prices, and you say, what's the best way to pack this backpack to get the most value of stuff into it? So it's a little sort of logical puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And these researchers in Australia gave this test to a bunch of young adults, and they tested how well they did when they were on stimulant medication and how well they did when they were not. And what they found was that when they were on stimulant medication, they, from the outside, looked to be doing much better. They were working more quickly. They were more diligent. They were more focused. But when they looked at the results of how well they were doing on this knapsack test, they weren't doing any better. And what they saw was that that was because they weren't actually making better decisions. They were just sort of randomly pulling things in and out of their backpack instead of focusing on it. So what I think some researchers believe is that this is a clue to why sometimes behavior in the classroom can improve on stimulant medication, but academic results don't. It's possible that these stimulants make you sit still and behave better, but they're not actually helping your brain process information better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You mentioned some other things that were troubling about continued use of these stimulants. What were some of the other issues that came up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. So James Swanson - the researcher who helped lead the MTA study - one data point that he really focuses on in thinking about this as a long-term treatment rather than a short term-one is that in the original MTA study, when young people took stimulant medication over the course of years, it had an effect on their growth, on their physical growth, on their height - that the kids who had consistently taken Ritalin were about an inch shorter than the kids who had not. And so Swanson and the other MTA researchers have continued to study this group through adolescence and even into adulthood. And the most recent study looked at them when they were 25 and continued to see this height differential. That the ones who had consistently taken stimulant medication all the way through childhood and even young adulthood - they continued to be about an inch shorter than the ones who had stopped taking it or who had never started at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Is there an explanation for that biologically that we know of?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: There isn't a definite explanation, no. We don't exactly know why that is. The most sort of logical one is that these medications affect appetite in a big way. So when I would talk to young people who were taking these medications, that was the thing that they talked about the most, that it - you just don't want to eat. And if you're an adolescent and you don't want to eat, you're very different than other adolescents. This is a time when kids are eating a ton, and that's helping their growth. So that would make sense as part of the reason for this, but there haven't been enough careful studies to say that that's the real reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: I mean, these are amphetamines, right? I mean, can they be addictive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Amphetamines, as a whole, can be addictive. The way that the medications are formulated, especially the ones that release the medication over an extended time, over the course of a day - those are certain safeguards that make them less likely to be addicted. The young people I talked to who took these medications did not feel that they were addicting at all. They found them very easy to stop. So yes, they can be addictive. There's certainly anecdotal stories about people who become dependent or even addicted to these medications, but that doesn't seem like a very big problem for most kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: We are speaking with Paul Tough. He is a contributing writer for The New York Times magazine. His recent cover story is titled "Have We Been Thinking About A.D.H.D. All Wrong?" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF BRITTANY HOWARD SONG, "POWER TO UNDO")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Paul Tough. He's a contributing writer for The New York Times magazine. He has a recent cover story about the continued growth of diagnosis of ADHD - attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - in the U.S. and on research that raises questions about the most common treatments. His article is titled "Have We Been Thinking About A.D.H.D. All Wrong?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Tough, you spoke to students across the country about this - with ADHD diagnosis - who'd been taking these stimulants. What did you hear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, I heard a variety of things. So I think every young person's experience is unique. But mostly, I felt like they had a pretty complex relationship to these drugs. So I think the way that these medications and the diagnosis in general is portrayed in the public is that this is, you know, a medical condition that has a medical solution. And in fact, the young people I talked to saw this as much more of a kind of constant negotiation between them and their medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of the young people I talked to talked about - used the word sacrifice when they talked about their stimulant medication. They saw that there were benefits to it. They saw that it was going to help them in some significant way going forward in life. But they didn't actually like the experience of taking them, often not at all. I mean, one of them said, I just hate taking it. You know, you, first of all, get this real rush. You feel like you're on top of the world, but then there's a real crash. And so he didn't love it, but he saw, like, that in certain circumstances, it was the right thing to do. And that's what I heard from a lot of kids, that they had gotten to the point where they knew what this medication would make them feel like. And rather than think of it as, say, diabetes medication - something you've got to take every day in order to survive - it was much more situational. It was something that they would take at certain times and certain moments, and then other times not take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah. There was this one guy that - who you called Cap, who used it when he was preparing for his SAT exams and for baseball and baseball practice 'cause he could really focus on pitches, and he thought it made him a better hitter. But he didn't like it. And I guess people felt that it changed their personalities in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. That was something that I heard from a lot of people, that their sort of love of life, their sense of humor - that a lot of that would change when they were on this medication, that they were - you know, at lunch, they were not the happy, social person that they had been. One of them said, you know, it's not like I'm unhappy. It's just like I'm kind of flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one girl who I spoke to, who I didn't include in the article, who talked about how it did sort of suppress her emotions. And she said that she had been having this day a couple of days before I spoke to her when her friends were going off to college, and she wanted to say goodbye to them all. And she decided that day not to take her medication because she wanted feel. She wanted to have this emotional connection, and she knew that if she was on the medication, she just would feel more flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You wrote that there are some people who believe that ADHD is a clear, you know, identifiable biological disease and therefore best treated with medication, but that increasingly, people think that it may be thought of not as a condition that you have but as something that you experience. What exactly does that mean? What are the implications of that idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, I think this is where this question gets really interesting to me. And the person who I think is sort of leading the way - the researcher who's leading the way on this is a British researcher named Edmund Sonuga-Barke who has been studying ADHD for 35 years. And in the last few years, he has really started to change his approach, and I think that's been influential in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he talks about ADHD as not having any kind of natural cutting point where you can say this person has it and this person does not have it, but instead that ADHD symptoms exist on a continuum, where almost everyone has some of these symptoms, and that there are some who - for whom it is really an extreme problem, but there's not a natural cutting point. And to him, this distinction is important not only scientifically, but also kind of, like, psychologically and emotionally, that it enables us to tell young people that this is not just a case of them having a deficit of a certain skill and that that's a disorder that has to be treated medically, but instead that their problems may have more to do with a misalignment between their own unique brain and the situation that they're in. And if that's the case, sometimes medication can still help make that environment more tolerable. But there also might be things that we could change in their environment, that they could change in their habits and patterns that would have the same kind of positive result that medication would have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Right. I mean, school is sometimes just going to be boring, and if your particular brain has a hard time focusing on boring stuff, I guess it's harder. What are the implications of that for treatment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: You know, it's interesting. It might not have implications for treatment, but it changes, I think, the way you think about your treatment and the way you think about yourself, the way you think about your own brain. I think when we give kids the message that this is a brain-based problem, that it's a disorder in the brain, that's something that they take in as a sort of identity, as a message about who they are and what they can accomplish. And if instead it is portrayed, I think, more accurately as a mismatch between where you are and how your brain works, that says something very different to kids. It says maybe medication is the right thing right now, but it's also possible that in the future, this is going to change, that you're going to find your way to another kind of situation that's not like high school English class, where your brain is actually going to be really powerful and really well suited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: There was one thing that you mentioned in the research - that some children with ADHD symptoms are at greater risk of more serious issues, and those are kids whose symptoms are accompanied by intense angers. I mean, what are the different risks there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Yeah. So this is the research of a researcher in Oregon named Joel Nigg. And I think this is really important. I think that one of the downsides of us having perceived this condition as this sort of yes or no, black or white disorder is that it has obscured the fact that there are really lots of different degrees of intensity of ADHD. So, you know, the young guy I talked to who, you know, was using it for baseball as much as he was using it for school - he almost certainly does not have a really intense case of ADHD. But there are lots of kids who do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what Joel Nigg has found is that between 30 and 40% of young people diagnosed with ADHD also have symptoms of intense anger as children and that that is often the beginning of real psychological problems. When you have both hyperactivity in impulse control and intense emotional dysregulation, that's a real warning sign, and that those kids - it's not just about changing their environment. They really do need treatment, which might include stimulant medication, but it also might include other things. That those young people have - are more likely to have coexisting other disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, depression, anxiety. And so they need a more careful set of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, I'm sure we're going to get a lot of reaction to this interview because it affects so many people, and people's experiences are all unique, and there is disagreement about this. You know, I happened to look at this magazine called ADDitude - that's A-D-D-itude - you're familiar with this - which describes itself as the nation's leading source of important news, expert advice and judgment-free understanding for families and adults living with attention deficit disorder. I just went to the website and right away was struck by a story attacking your article, calls it misrepresentative, biased and dangerous. Have you looked at this stuff?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: I have, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Yeah. I mean, it specifically says that, in some cases, you quoted people who you didn't interview. Wes Crenshaw says he told a Times fact-checker before the article was published that the reporter's information was incorrect and asked for an interview to set the record straight, none was granted. Generally, what do you say about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Well, I'll say first that that particular claim that Wes Crenshaw asked for an interview is not true. So the reason that ADDitude is responding so intensely, I think, is because I wrote about this magazine, about ADDitude, in my article. And one of the things that I noticed in ADDitude was that there were a number of articles aimed at parents of children who were resisting the diagnosis and resisting medication treatment. And I'd talked to a lot of these kids - right? - who were themselves being treated and who had really mixed feelings about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the idea that parents need a strategy to persuade their kids to take medication felt really out of keeping with the research that I was reading - that medication works for some kids but it doesn't work for all kids, that on the whole, the benefits of stimulant medication outweigh the deficits for most people, but for individual kids, sometimes it is not the right choice. And I don't think that it's the job of parents to try to persuade their kids to keep taking this medication when they don't want to. You know, the research shows that lots of them don't want to, and lots of them stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so these articles from ADDitude magazine that I mentioned, that they're responding to, were all in one way or another trying to give parents arguments and approaches to try to convince their kids to take this medication. And so that's what I wrote about. It's true I didn't go follow up and interview these people because I was just quoting accurately the articles that they wrote in this magazine. And I think that the magazine felt wounded by the fact that I identified these articles as being a part of that movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: You know, the human mind is an awfully complicated thing, to say the least. And there are, you know, many circumstances in treatment in which medications are effective for reasons that just aren't clear, right? I think that is true of a lot of antidepressants - right? - for a long time. I don't know if it still is. And I'm just wondering, as you looked at this research on ADHD, are there people who are optimistic that they will get to a clearer understanding of its origin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: I think so, yeah. I mean, I think there's a mix of feelings about it. I think there are hopes that that sort of, you know, intense scientific research will help us. But I think there are more people, and this is including some of the researchers who I wrote about, who say that that's not where our research focus is going to be most useful, that there may be two directions that seem most useful. One is what Joel Nigg is doing and trying to figure out if there are subtypes within this group that is diagnosed with ADHD who have different problems, different maybe genetic signatures and different needs for treatment. And instead of saying you've got ADHD or you don't, if we can be more precise in what intensity of ADHD, what type of ADHD you have, we can give you more helpful treatment suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then I think the other angle that I find really reassuring is to think about environments. So instead of to think of this as just a biological problem that has a biological solution, think about the environmental side of it. And a lot of the research suggests that as environments change for young people, their symptoms change as well. But mostly what we see is that just kind of happens as you go through life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not a big push and I think there hasn't been a lot of study of, if we are actually intentional about how we change young people's environments, can we predictably make a difference in their symptoms? My hope is that those two strands of research together will make a real difference, that we not only will be able to say, well, this is the particular signature of ADHD that you have, but we'll also be able to say, and this is the kind of intervention, whether environmental or pharmaceutical, that might help your symptoms the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Well, Paul Tough, thank you so much for speaking with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGH: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVIES: Paul Tough is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="discussion" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Discussion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 800 measles cases and 10 outbreaks were reported in the United States during the first 16 weeks of 2025, representing approximately a 180% increase over the 285 measles cases reported in the United States during all of 2024. Most cases have been associated with an ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 11% of measles patients have been hospitalized, and three deaths have been reported. Similar to previous years (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;), nearly all (96%) cases occurred in persons who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, and 77% of cases occurred in persons who were unvaccinated when excluding cases reported by Texas. Most (92%) imported cases occurred among U.S. residents returning to the United States while infectious and from all six World Health Organization regions. Adherence to standard measles control measures, including isolation and quarantine, as well as high vaccination coverage locally, prevented secondary transmission from most of these persons who were infectious after returning from travel abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cases reported during 2025 have been associated with an ongoing outbreak in close-knit communities in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, resulting in the second largest outbreak in the United States since elimination was declared in 2000. During 2001–2023, approximately 90% of U.S. measles outbreaks with 50 or more cases occurred in close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage (&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;). Such communities might have frequent communal gatherings and have concerns about engaging with public health and health care systems for testing, treatment, and vaccination. The United States, Canada,&lt;sup&gt;†††&lt;/sup&gt; and Mexico are all experiencing large, expanding outbreaks in similar interconnected communities. Frequent travel among similar communities across multiple states and countries might facilitate the rapid spread of measles outbreaks. The risk for widespread measles transmission in the United States remains low because of high population immunity resulting from high measles vaccination coverage. However, recent increasing global measles incidence in areas frequently visited by U.S. travelers, coupled with declines in MMR vaccination coverage in many U.S. jurisdictions to &amp;lt;95% (the estimated population-level immunity necessary to prevent measles outbreaks), and spread of measles from ongoing domestic outbreaks to other jurisdictions, have increased the risk for ongoing measles transmission within the United States (&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, imported cases were likely underreported because 30% of reported outbreaks had no known source. Second, outbreak-related cases were likely underreported because certain persons in affected communities might not engage with the health care and public health systems. Third, distinguishing unvaccinated patients from patients with unknown measles vaccination status in Texas was not possible; the Texas Immunization Registry legally requires explicit consent, or opt-in, for adults and by parent or guardian for children to enroll.&lt;sup&gt;§§§&lt;/sup&gt; Persons with no records available are considered to have an unverified vaccination history. Finally, definitive linkages between the large outbreak in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas and cases reported in Kansas could not be identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Implications for Public Health Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To protect against measles and its complications before traveling internationally, all persons aged ≥12 months should have documented receipt of 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine, and infants aged 6–11 months of age should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine (&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;). Persons residing in or traveling domestically to outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance, which is developed based on review and analysis of the local outbreak epidemiology (&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;). Infants aged &amp;lt;6 months are at high risk for measles complications but are too young to be vaccinated, and therefore depend upon population immunity and passively transferred maternal measles antibodies (from previously vaccinated or infected mothers) to prevent infections and related complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health care providers continue to serve on the front lines to identify measles cases, alert public health departments&lt;sup&gt;¶¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;, ensure recommended testing, and implement measles isolation precautions to prevent health care–associated and community-based transmission. Health care providers should consider measles in the differential diagnosis for all patients (especially those who are unvaccinated) who 1) have fever (temperature ≥101°F [≥38.3°C]) and a generalized maculopapular rash with cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis, 2) have recently traveled outside the country or to a U.S. region with a known measles outbreak, or 3) have other known or suspected exposure to measles (&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;). Although no specific Food and Drug Administration–approved antiviral therapy for measles exists, rapid access to supportive care can help relieve symptoms and treat complications such as pneumonia and secondary bacterial and viral infections. Providers should also offer and encourage vaccination for eligible patients who lack presumptive evidence of immunity to measles (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health departments might benefit from using a CDC checklist**** to help guide their readiness activities such as preparing for laboratory testing and data reporting needs, conducting tabletop exercises, and facilitating early engagement with communities with low vaccination coverage and their trusted messengers before measles and other vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks occur. To identify communities at risk, public health departments should consider using both MMR vaccination coverage data from immunization information systems and kindergarten entry and vaccination exemption data from kindergarten entry records. Standard measles control interventions, including vaccination, isolation, quarantine, and postexposure prophylaxis (i.e., administration of MMR vaccine within 72 hours of exposure or immunoglobulin within 6 days of exposure for certain persons) (&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;), might be challenging to implement in certain communities. Therefore, public health departments should consider partnering with trusted community messengers (e.g., clinicians and religious leaders) on culturally competent community engagement, education, vaccination efforts, and potentially acceptable community infection control approaches. Coordination with health care facilities, early childhood education facilities and schools, and other congregate settings that surround or serve these communities to prepare for measles cases regarding appropriate infection prevention and control, testing, public health follow-up, and early childhood education or school exclusion policies is crucial to limit transmission. Increasing national and local MMR vaccination coverage is essential to preventing measles cases and outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

I first suggested getting her one when she turned 4, but Lanna was vehemently opposed to the idea because she was convinced that our daughter would injure herself. Tillie is an active child with no disabilities that would impair her ability to ride a bike. Each year I have brought this up with my wife, but there’s always a reason she vetoes it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmhwt00263575fgl08xyz@published"&gt;When I suggested getting Tillie a bike last Christmas, Lanna refused, claiming Tillie would “take off somewhere and get run over or kidnapped.” Tillie is growing increasingly upset over not having a bike of her own and being able to ride with her friends (who have been riding since before kindergarten) and has had numerous fights with her mother over this. When I asked Lanna what age she would be comfortable with allowing our daughter to have a bike, her reply was “maybe 13 or 14.” I think this is completely unreasonable, but she refuses to budge. I am concerned that Tillie will not only miss out on a central part of childhood, but also that her relationship with her mother will be damaged. What can I do to get my wife to see how out of line her position is?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmi3g002a3575u0ljyuhc@published"&gt;I have never known a kid who learned to ride a bicycle without at least a few scrapes and falls. And I suppose I am a bit sympathetic, since I am a giant baby who can’t stand the sight of blood. Your wife’s fear that Tillie might injure herself—like many of the worries and anxieties we have for our kids—is not necessarily unreasonable, in and of itself. But that doesn’t mean that Lanna can reasonably base all parenting decisions on that fear, or Tillie would never get to do or experience anything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmi5k002b35754vlj7e8x@published"&gt;When talking with Lanna, I wouldn’t focus on the fact that you think she’s wrong or being ridiculous or harming her relationship with Tillie. I would instead try to talk in positive terms about what you both want for Tillie. Presumably, you want her to be brave, confident, and independent enough to try new things. You want to shield her from unnecessary danger without limiting her opportunities to learn and explore. You want to raise her in a supportive environment and let her know that you believe in her. You want her to be able to figure out hard things and learn how to solve problems (and know that she can!), develop resilience, and ultimately grow up to trust in herself and her ability. You don’t want her to always worry that she won’t be able to do something, or refrain from trying because she thinks she might fail.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmiag002c3575vtcjdefl@published"&gt;I’m guessing that if Lanna is this worried about a very typical kid thing like riding a bike, it’s probably not the only way her anxiety over Tillie manifests. If she does have rather excessive anxiety as a parent and it’s interfering with the opportunities Tillie has to learn and have fun, then I think it’s important for Lanna to try to recognize what’s going on, acknowledge the impact on Tillie, and perhaps seek whatever support may be necessary to help her manage that anxiety. Again, it’s so natural to be worried about our kids; to not want to see them threatened or hurt—that’s always going to be the case! But we shouldn’t let our understandable worries and anxieties interfere with their daily lives, make them question their own abilities, or prevent them from doing the normal, fun things they really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmigh002f3575daishwhq@published"&gt;I am a cis woman in my early 30s who has known for a while that I am not interested in having biological children (and I’m not that interested in having non-biological children, either). I have a partner, and he is in agreement with me on this. The issue is my parents. They want me to have kids, and while they are kind of trying to be respectful about my decision, it’s clear they think that I’m too young to have decided, that I might change my mind, or that I’m just saying it to be dramatic. Compounding this is the fact that I’ve had some pretty serious medical issues that would make having a kid difficult, if not traumatic; when I’ve brought this up as a point in favor of not reproducing, I have been met with dismissal over my legitimate fears (pain and potentially life-threatening complications) to the tune of “but you’d have a baby at the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmiii002g3575lbwjrol8@published"&gt;I worry that I wouldn’t have their support if I had to pursue medical interventions for my health issues that would prevent me from having kids, but when I have brought this up as a possibility, they have also dismissed it. For the record, I like kids, and my younger sister has always wanted kids and will probably have them in the next few years, so I am not depriving my parents of grandchildren. I often find myself arguing with them in my head, trying to get them to support my decision. How do I handle these frustrating feelings I have toward my (very lovely!) parents when it feels like they don’t respect this major life decision I have made?&lt;/p&gt;

I understand why you feel frustrated, disappointed, and kind of judged. You asked what to do about those feelings, and I think it’s important to acknowledge them. It’s okay to be upset or annoyed; to wish that your parents understood and accepted where you’re coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

Ultimately, you don’t need your parents’ approval or even their acceptance in this, and I hope they can eventually grasp the fact that your reproductive decisions have nothing to do with them. It’s up to you and only you to make the choices you feel are best for your health and wellbeing. If you’re sure about what’s right for you, that’s what matters most—try to let that be all the affirmation you need.&lt;/p&gt;

Alicia has never really bonded with her sister, and when I asked her about what she wanted to do for her birthday party, she said she wants to have one without her sister being there.&lt;br&gt;When I tried to explain to her how sad that would be for Mariana and asked her to imagine how she would feel if Mariana wanted to leave her out, she said she wouldn’t care. She has been very persistent in her desire not to have Mariana at her party, so much so that she has even told us we could make it her “present.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmj5b002o35757oh6kmrr@published"&gt;Now my husband is actually starting to think that she shouldn’t have to include Mariana if she doesn’t want to “because it’s her birthday,” and has suggested we leave her at home with a sitter. Mariana is old enough to understand being excluded and I won’t agree to something so hurtful. This is becoming so much of an issue I am considering not having a party for Alicia at all. How can I resolve this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmjen002r35758bpae36o@published"&gt;If it weren’t for the way Alicia seems so determined to leave her little sister out, I wouldn’t make a huge deal out of the party itself. I think it’s pretty common for families to hold a family birthday celebration as well as a separate party for a kid’s friends? Plus, a 3-year age gap means there won’t always be a natural overlap when it comes to friend groups or interests. My kids have had birthday friend-parties their sibling didn’t attend, not because they flat-out weren’t welcome but because they just might not have been super interested in or ready for whatever the party activity happened to be. My older child is 17, so for years now she’s often had some sort of birthday hangout with her friends and no one else; that doesn’t mean she doesn’t love her little sister or want her around.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmjhj002s3575o7vr8y0v@published"&gt;What you’re talking about sounds like something else, though, since you say that Alicia has never really bonded with Mariana. I understand why you might want to tell Alicia that if she has a party, Mariana has to at least have the option of tagging along, partly to establish the basic expectation of kindness and inclusion in your family. If that’s the decision, you and your husband can in turn make sure that Mariana is entertained and not disrupting Alicia’s fun with her friends (perhaps inviting one friend of Mariana’s to keep her company, if you think that would help?).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmjk0002t3575lglxyj6a@published"&gt;Whatever you decide to do about this one particular party, the real issue, one you’ll continue to deal with, is the fact that Alicia doesn’t seem to enjoy being with her little sister. I understand why you’d find that upsetting or sad. But it won’t necessarily be like this forever. Sibling relationships change all the time. Separate from the birthday party conversation, try to talk with Alicia about her feelings about her little sister, do your best to listen and understand what those feelings are based on. You need to know what she’s thinking and feeling—and why—if you want to help her think about her sister differently and express her feelings in less hurtful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. vowing to reexamine the childhood vaccination schedule, measles and other previously eliminated infectious diseases could become more common. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833361"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; published today by epidemiologists at Stanford University attempts to quantify those impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Using a computer model, the authors found that with current state-level vaccination rates, measles could reestablish itself and become consistently present in the United States in the next two decades. Their model predicted this outcome in 83 percent of simulations. If current vaccination rates stay the same, the model estimated that the US could see more than 850,000 cases, 170,000 hospitalizations, and 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. The results appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I don’t see this as speculative. It is a modeling exercise, but it’s based on good numbers,” says Jeffrey Griffiths, professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “The big point is that measles is very likely to become endemic quickly if we continue in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000 after decades of successful vaccination campaigns. Elimination means there has been no chain of disease transmission inside a country lasting longer than 12 months. The current measles outbreak in Texas, however, could put that status at risk. With more than 600 cases, 64 hospitalizations, and two deaths, it’s the largest outbreak the state has seen since 1992, when 990 cases were linked to a single outbreak. Nationally, the US has seen &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;800 cases of measles so far in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the most since 2019. Last year, there were 285 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We’re really at a point where we should be trying to increase vaccination as much as possible,” says Mathew Kiang, assistant professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University and one of the authors of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Childhood vaccination in the US has been on a downward trend. Data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from state and local vaccination programs found that from the 2019–2020 school year to the 2022–2023 school year, coverage among kindergartners with state-required vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;declined from 95 percent to approximately 93 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Those vaccines included MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), polio, and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the current study, Kiang and his colleagues modeled each state separately, taking into account their vaccination rates, which ranged from 88 percent to 96 percent for measles, 78 percent to 91 percent for diphtheria, and 90 percent to 97 percent for the polio vaccine. Other variables included demographics of the population, vaccine efficacy, risk of disease importation, typical duration of the infection, the time between exposure and being able to spread the disease, and the contagiousness of the disease, also known as the basic reproduction number. Measles is highly contagious, with one person on average being able to infect 12 to 18 people. The researchers used 12 as the basic reproduction number in their study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:55:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPZWxEVExubzVqYVVjWlJDd3pUQm9aSXhQbzNqVGJIeGNqVTdWTWkxZkxENllGamxZTnRfYkJETU1iZ3VVWVlVc0tkLVl1NW82dFA5T1FYY0NHdnpjSE03UGZLeWN5QUd5dWJSSmR0QUZONFpSdGVMQVVIY0tXNzFKQTBYZkRjYnFrTGNYSnQyaDZEN2pLWmZnODZIY0tYZHZ3aXNtT2VWVTA3ekU</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，帮助您排便的最佳乳制品- EatingWell | The Best Dairy Product to Help You Poop, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPNERFWExiVHBTOGw4VGRKMWhodjlJd0dNWWFEeHp1b3cwcTFzV005YXNaV2I5aEN0Ni1VaHR1X3pwc2kwaTYxYVVKUlZOZ3UyOXk3YzRxcm85YnRRNWVjSEs4dzdMUzA2dmttT3V2ZHk5TWdXVHM4UmVXcFR6RGwzYg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike cream on milk, dairy products might not rise to the top of your mind when you consider which foods speed up your digestion. If anything, dairy has a reputation for backing you up, not helping you go to the bathroom. Many people have long believed that the proteins in cow’s milk slow down bowel movements—a concept some research has suggested may be true.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

In fact, some are strongly linked with helping you poop. The best example? &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7664397/what-is-kefir/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kefir&lt;/a&gt;. This fermented dairy drink (usually found in the dairy case alongside yogurt and milk) has a unique mix of probiotics that may help calm inflammation, diversify the microbiome and even improve lactose digestion. Taken together, these effects can promote healthier, more regular BMs.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By now, you’ve probably heard that a healthy gut microbiome (the trillions of bacteria that inhabit your intestines) is key to consistent, comfortable bowel movements. One of the best ways to maintain a thriving microbiome is to “feed” it foods high in probiotics. Kefir certainly fits the bill. “Kefir contains over 30 probiotic strains—way more than most supplements,” says&lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Alyssa Simpson, RDN, CGN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;, a digestive health dietitian in Phoenix.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Giving your gut these dozens of beneficial bacterial strains may help diversify the microbiome, creating a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthier gut&lt;/a&gt; and improving digestion, says &lt;a href="https://winnersdrinkmilk.com/about-adai/meet-our-staff/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Hanna Kelley, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;, director of health and wellness for the American Dairy Association of Indiana. Research seems to agree, with studies finding a rich diversity of gut microbes helpful for increasing stool frequency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Soften Stool and Promote Gut Movement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The friendly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16530/can-probiotics-really-help-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; in kefir may also help prevent constipation by making your stool easier to pass. “The probiotics in kefir … soften stools and regulate gut muscles so they move more effectively,” says Kelley. “This makes bowel movements more consistent and comfortable.” While research is limited, one older study found that people who drank kefir daily for four weeks experienced improved bowel satisfaction scores and had accelerated colonic transit (the time it takes for poop to move through the colon).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Help Reduce Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chronic inflammation doesn’t just increase the risk of chronic diseases, it can also take a toll on digestive health and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944613/inflammation-might-be-the-reason-you-cant-poop-heres-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;contribute to constipation&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, kefir may help quell an inflamed digestive tract, leading to more frequent bowel movements. “Kefir may reduce gut inflammation, improving gut barrier function—changes that are known to support motility,” says Simpson. She points to a study in which peptides, bioactive compounds and probiotic strains in kefir positively affected inflammation and intestinal permeability, which is important for nutrient absorption and preventing harmful substances from entering the bloodstream.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Diarrhea is often the chief symptom of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lactose intolerance&lt;/a&gt;, but in about 30% of cases, it manifests with constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If your intolerance causes you to get backed up, you might want to keep kefir on hand. “Studies have shown kefir may improve lactose digestion for those who are lactose-intolerant but are still looking for dairy’s nutrition and health benefits,” says Kelley.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And since kefir is low in lactose to begin with, it can be a helpful dairy product for people who’d like to reap nutrients like protein and calcium without creating unpleasant GI symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can use kefir in many of the same ways as yogurt—but since it’s drinkable, you can start by consuming it as a beverage. Keep in mind, kefir has a strong taste that can take some getting used to. If you find its flavor too potent for solo drinking, you might prefer to use it in recipes. “Add it to smoothies, homemade dressings or even overnight oats to give your gut variety,” Kelley suggests.

A few additional strategies to prevent constipation include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat Enough (but Not Too Much) Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber adds bulk and softness to stool, making it essential for regular BMs. Just note that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; such a thing as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043390/too-much-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;overdoing it&lt;/a&gt;. “Fiber can help, but more isn’t always better—focus on the types your gut tolerates, introduce it slowly and listen to how your body responds,” says Simpson. Ideally, aim for 25 grams of fiber per day for women and 38 grams for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay On Top of Hydration:&lt;/strong&gt; According to Simpson, dehydration is a common culprit behind &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911394/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-constipation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;. To hydrate adequately, aim for about 11.5 cups of fluid per day for women and 15.5 cups for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Plenty of Activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Research shows that regular exercise can be a helpful treatment for constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether it’s taking your dog for a walk, mowing the lawn or taking a cardio dance class, finding ways to stay active throughout the day can go a long way in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;keeping you regular&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to helping you poop, not all dairy products are created equal. Among the many dairy products, kefir has the best track record for getting bowels moving. This fermented beverage provides gut-healthy probiotics to support optimal digestive health. Enjoy kefir as a stand-alone drink or add it to sweet or savory recipes for a tangy, gut-healthy boost.&lt;br&gt;

                        Illinois' first confirmed case of measles this year was reported Wednesday in southern Illinois.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Illinois Department of Public Health via the Southern 7 Health Department said that the case was confirmed by lab testing on Wednesday. An unidentified adult in "far southern Illinois" went to a clinic seeking treatment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The clinic is checking the immune status of other patients at that location who might have been exposed. Officials are working to locate any other locations where the individual could have exposed others.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
IDPH said that there is a very small risk of community transmission. Most people are vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella as a child, limiting the risk. Healthcare providers said that after an exposure, symptoms could take between seven and 21 days to reveal themselves. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile, health officials with the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services announced a second confirmed case of measles in the state this year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The case occurred in March in a child, who is not a U.S. resident, was traveling through the commonwealth when they sought treatment. Officials said the child was diagnosed at a health care facility in Kentucky, which is why the case will be counted as a Kentucky incident.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kentucky’s first confirmed measles case of 2025 occurred in an adult resident in February who had recently traveled internationally.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Missouri, Louisiana and Virginia also reported their first cases in the past week. The nation's hotspot continues to be west Texas, with over 600 cases. &lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of health researchers at the National Institute of Gastroenterology, in Italy, has found an association between regularly eating poultry and early death due to digestive system cancers. In their study &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1370" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nutrients&lt;/i&gt;, the group analyzed health-related data for 4,869 adults living in Italy over a 20-year period.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Prior research has suggested that eating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/poultry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; (mainly chicken) is healthier than eating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/red+meat/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; as a protein source because it poses less risk of contributing to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and some gastrointestinal cancers. But now, this latest research suggests eating chicken on a regular basis could be linked to certain types of gastrointestinal cancers and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;early death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data for this study was collected during interviews and by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+staff/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical staff&lt;/a&gt; conducting health examinations. Each of the people studied also filled out questionnaires regarding their eating habits. Their health status was evaluated using medical records and regional databases that allowed the team to include deaths in the study as well. One of the factors they looked at included how often subjects ate meat or poultry; another was the rate of development of gastrointestinal cancers and resulting deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a higher incidence of gastrointestinal cancer development and also early deaths related to those cancer cases among people who ate more than 300 grams of poultry per week. The risk of dying at that level, they found, was 27% higher compared to people who ate just 100 grams of poultry per week or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team acknowledges that more research is required to understand their findings. They were not able to determine, for example, if the increased rate of death from eating poultry was due directly to consuming the poultry or if it was related to how it was cooked, such as whether it was fried or breaded, or if certain seasonings were added. Also, while the study adjusted for some health and lifestyle factors, one potentially serious limitation was physical activity, such as amount and types of exercise, was not measured.&lt;/p&gt;

            Concerned that the nation’s health leadership is casting unfounded doubt on the safety of well-studied vaccines and may take action to curb their use, a group of public health experts is working to put pieces in place to respond.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00023b6ohbnie1dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The initiative, the Vaccine Integrity Project, will be funded by a foundation backed by Walmart heiress Christy Walton and has a steering committee helmed by former US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg and former National Academy of Medicine President Dr. Harvey Fineberg, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, who is leading the initiative and who serves as director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The effort will consider what’s needed to safeguard vaccine policy and use in the US, including whether there’s a need for a new independent body to evaluate vaccine safety and effectiveness, Osterholm said ahead of Thursday’s announcement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00043b6oozra7zcg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There have been conversations happening for months now across the public health community about, ‘what will we do if US government vaccine information becomes corrupted or the system that helps to ensure their safety and efficacy are compromised?’ “ he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The initiative is being formed in response to actions by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html"&gt;mixed messages&lt;/a&gt; about the measles vaccine amid a deadly outbreak, accused advisers to federal health agencies of conflicts of interest and pledged to start a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes/index.html"&gt;major autism study&lt;/a&gt; that experts fear will falsely tie the condition to vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a statement Thursday, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon called the project “a self-appointed echo chamber masquerading as oversight.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vkmbss0004356od39eadaz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Led by establishment leaders, it’s less about integrity and more about salvaging the credibility of a public health bureaucracy that failed millions during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said. He added that Kennedy and NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya “will continue to prioritize open scientific debate and Gold Standard of Science to inform decision making.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00063b6ompvxyycb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Vaccine Integrity Project’s first move will be to hold a series of information-gathering sessions, pulling together experts from local public health departments, medical associations, academia, public policy, industry and others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00073b6o8q85dqg5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The initial goal is to determine “what is important to have going forward if, in fact, there should be compromise by the federal government in terms of our vaccine enterprise,” Osterholm said. “We can’t say at this point that that’s happened, but we don’t want to wait until the moment it might happen, and we have enough signals that that is.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00083b6otw7eef2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He pointed to Kennedy’s vaccine comments, as well as moves like some Minnesota state legislators’ introduction of &lt;a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF3219&amp;amp;type=bill&amp;amp;version=0&amp;amp;session_year=2025&amp;amp;session_number=0" target="_blank"&gt;a bill&lt;/a&gt; this week “to declare that mRNA vaccine technology is a weapon of mass destruction and that it should be immediately taken off the market and anyone using it would be liable for criminal activity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z00093b6oo96hiqb5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Who’s going to respond to that?” Osterholm asked. “Is anybody at the federal government level going to respond to activities like that? That’s a question I think we are left, at this point, unanswered.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vkh0650002356o1w0msd68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hamburg and Fineberg wrote in an opinion piece about the project in the health publication &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/vaccine-integrity-project-acip-cdc-fda-rfk-jr-trump-political-interference/?utm_campaign=rss" target="_blank"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that “the stakes are too high for us to sit back and watch. We cannot allow vaccine-preventable conditions, such as measles and whooping cough, to become regularly occurring outbreaks here in the US again, causing needless suffering and death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9vkn6xw0007356ogb5r42ni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They added that, “given [Kennedy’s] history as the &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" target="_blank"&gt;leader &lt;/a&gt;of an anti-vaccine organization, it is only prudent to anticipate ways the secretary could in the future exert his authority to reduce vaccine accessibility and discourage lifesaving immunizations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z000a3b6ozv8y7nba@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “initial feedback phase,” as Osterholm called it, will start this month and last until early August.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9v7ud4z000b3b6ozwek6ud5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t know what’s this is going to look like at the end, but we’ll only find out by listening to all of these groups,” Osterholm said. “At the end of that process, hopefully we can all look at it and come to a similar conclusion, that this is what’s necessary or not necessary to protect the vaccine enterprise.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;’s interest in reexamining the childhood vaccine schedule could substantially reduce immunization coverage, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QWJTISTL65E6RDG4YVE3TKUSU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This is a warning of what our future could look like,” said Mujeeb Basit, a professor and expert on modeling and disease spread at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.

Montana last week reported its first measles cases in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YRT7YUMZZGMRAZDUCQAGRJOKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The majority of the infections have been reported in a West Texas outbreak that has led to the deaths of two children.

More than half the adults surveyed expressed uncertainty about whether to believe false assertions, such as that the measles vaccine is more dangerous than the disease — claims that Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" target="_blank"&gt;amplified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P6KCD4F7INF7XCTB4RYS2HDPIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the decade before a measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, an estimated 3 million to 4 million people in the U.S. were infected each year, 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 suffered swelling of the brain, or encephalitis, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2UYIN6WCNBTJBEB2T7SM2HFRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But in 2000 the U.S. was finally able to declare measles “eliminated,” a term that means no continuous spread for more than a year. Cases and outbreaks still occur because of international travel, typically with an under-immunized U.S. traveler returning from a country where measles is endemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NFMUQLCK5FAXLEGRM2WA5LWWXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For the new research, scientists used state vaccination, birth and death rates to find their results. They estimated current vaccination coverage for measles at 87.7 percent to 95.6 percent. To prevent measles outbreaks, 95 percent of a community must &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/24/measles-vaccine-booster-outbreak-states/" target="_blank"&gt;receive two doses &lt;/a&gt;of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSBU6TKCPVC7HOAF3MFC5ZHOFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Based on what scientists know about the epidemiology of measles, one of the most contagious diseases on Earth, they forecast how it would spread from one community to another and how quickly it could spread regularly at increased rates throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X4MBV7OM3ZF43FB6Y73WVTXXTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study did not take into account the difference in vaccination rates within a state, the authors said. Nor did it account for changes in immunization rates when infections increased because of an outbreak, which occurred during the covid pandemic, Basit said. But even the most conservative estimates underscore the severe consequences if measles reestablishes itself in the U.S., the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ESTN53RNNBKBLPV57PFPJWSVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles outbreaks are surging globally, with Romania last year reporting the largest number of cases among 53 countries in Europe and Central Asia, according to the World Health Organization. Romania, with a population of about 19 million, had more than 30,000 cases in 2024, followed by Kazakhstan with about 28,000 cases. Romania’s recent measles surge is linked to declining vaccination rates, vaccine hesitancy, and disruptions in the health system during the pandemic, health experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KPCROIYM2NGITD7Q5QSHLOVDCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the U.S., public health and infectious-disease experts have been talking for months about ways to combat false claims and misinformation about vaccines.

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have produced the most detailed image to date of a bacteriophage, or phage—a kind of virus that kills bacteria—that has allowed them to see for the first time the structural makeup of the part of the virus that directly attaches to its target Mycobacterium cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work could enable new therapies that use bioengineered phages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now you’ve got like a spec sheet for going in and designing phages so that they’ll bind to different kinds of cells,” says Graham Hatfull, a professor of biotechnology at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s important because of what a bacteriophage, or phage for short, does after it binds to a bacterial cell: it pierces a hole in the cell membrane and injects its own DNA, turning the bacteria into a phage factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With many bacteria growing increasingly resistant to the antibiotics we use to kill them, phages are in some cases the only option to fight off bacterial infections. They are, however, picky assassins: A particular kind of phage will typically attack just one strain of bacteria. The ability to &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/bacteriophages-engineered-phages-1681432-2/"&gt;engineer a phage&lt;/a&gt; to seek out and destroy a specific bacteria could be a medical game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.027"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phages have been evolving for billions of years. Despite all the variation this long history has given rise to, they almost all share similar components: a capsid, a tail tube, and a tail tip. Some parts are easier to image than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phage capsid sits like a head atop the narrow tail tube. Researchers have for some time been able to capture high-resolution imagery a phage’s capsid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, it’s gigantic and easy to find,” says Krista Freeman, a research associate in Hatfull’s lab. It’s also composed of 60 symmetrical parts that can be averaged together to boost the signal. Imaging a phage using cryo-electron microscopy, one of the two imaging techniques used in this work, entails stitching together many images from different angles. Because of the part’s symmetry, relatively few images are needed to assemble enough information to piece together an entire capsid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the phage’s body is smaller and less symmetric by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you have to be more careful,” Freeman says. “You have to find more particles, and do more hunting, and do more manual manipulations. It’s much less automated than getting the big structure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phages are made up of bundles of tangled, intertwined proteins that loop around and through the structure. They are less like a globe, with its information painted on the surface, and more like a sculpture of a flower—constructed out of Slinkies. In practice, this means piecing together a complete image takes tens of thousands of images of phages, all oriented in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this massive amount of data and a massive amount of computing power, Freeman was able to recreate the tail tube and, perhaps most tantalizingly, the tip of the tail, which binds to the bacteria. Currently, researchers do not know why a particular phage &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/bacteriophages-bacteria-2075422-2/"&gt;attacks&lt;/a&gt; a particular strain of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tip of the tail, that’s the part that’s recognizing the bacteria cell,” Hatfull says. “We’re especially interested in it for this reason.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their high-definition images have allowed them to see structures that had previously only been resolved to a fuzzy grayscale that indicated the density of electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now you can show every molecular component in this thing,” Freeman says. “And it’s just breathtaking.” The new images also reveal structural information that researchers can explore to better understand the point of contact between a phage and its bacterial target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was astonishing to find out how complex the tail tip structure is,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images are made dynamic thanks to work done by Raphael Park and his colleagues at Scripps Research, who used another kind of imaging, cryo-electron tomography, which images phages bound to the bacterial cell, highlighting the entire phage and where it attaches to the bacterial cell surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some images, the phage’s DNA is plainly visible inside the capsid; in others, it has made its way through the cell wall of the bacteria. Between these two steps, “there are some subtle differences,” in the structure of the phage, Hatfull says. These may point to the mechanism by which the DNA is triggered to leave the capsid or how it is transported through the tail tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are new insights,” Hatfull says. “There are a lot of questions remaining.” But Hatfull, Freeman, and researchers across the world can now start thinking seriously about beginning to engineer phages to recognize different bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before, we wouldn’t have stood a chance. And now, doing this is going to become completely routine.”&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings suggest that the window of opportunity for treating allergies could extend into adulthood, raising the prospect of new treatments for those severely affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Constant fear of life-threatening reactions place a huge burden on people with peanut allergy,” said Stephen Till, the professor who led the research at King’s College London. “The only way to manage a peanut allergy is strict avoidance and treatment of allergic reactions, including with adrenaline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Although peanut immunotherapy is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/may/08/nhs-trial-uses-daily-doses-of-food-allergens-to-tackle-severe-reactions" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;known to be effective in children&lt;/a&gt;, this trial provides preliminary evidence that adults can also be desensitised and that this improves quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Grown Up Peanut Immunotherapy (GUPI) trial recruited 21 adults aged between 18 and 40 with a clinical diagnosis of peanut allergy. The participants were initially given a dose of 0.8mg peanut flour mixed in with food, then 1.5mg 30 minutes later followed by 3mg a further 30 minutes later. Those who were able to safely tolerate these very low doses – equivalent to less than 1% of a peanut – in a clinical setting were continued on a daily dose at home for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Participants returned every two weeks to increase their dose under supervision until they reached a 1g dose, the equivalent of four peanuts. The participants maintained a daily dose for three months, after which 67% of them were able to consume at least 1.4g of peanut protein – the equivalent of five peanuts – without reacting. The findings are &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/all.16493" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the journal Allergy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Living with peanut allergy is a huge burden due to the need for constant vigilance and the risk of accidental exposures,” said Hannah Hunter, lead author and a specialist allergy dietitian at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust. “Many participants who completed the trial told us that the treatment had been life-changing and they were no longer living in fear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some patients took longer than others to desensitise – time on the trial ranged from eight to 14 months before the pandemic, although Covid-related delays meant the process took 23 months for some participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After the trial, the participants were able to continue their daily peanut consumption to remain desensitised. They were still considered allergic, however, and were advised not to consume more than their daily dose and to still carry an adrenaline EpiPen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Chris, 28, was diagnosed with a peanut allergy as a baby and said that, before participating in the trial, the possibility of accidental exposure to peanuts was a source of anxiety. “Now, I have four peanuts every day with my breakfast to maintain my immunity,” he said. “Before, a tiny mistake could have life-threatening impacts but now I don’t have the fear that I might collapse and die from eating a takeaway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A larger multi-centre trial would be required before the treatment could be introduced more widely, but the findings suggest the approach could be as effective for adults with severe allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Adam Fox, chair of the national allergy study group at King’s College London, said: “Conventional wisdom has been that oral immunotherapy for food is really just for children and there is clear evidence that the younger it is started, the safer and better the outcome. However, that doesn’t mean that the benefits would not still be worthwhile for adults, and this study shows that for many, oral immunotherapy for peanut, at least, can still make a real difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 15:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPRHR0VnJfNXBqTXlnVHVSV3ItSWFxbEUtVkx3eHRNYlR3Z2xrSGZkOFBVLWMwa0pxM19zaGJCQ1UxR2FnMlN4WFZXOGZPZ3FlSHZValB5Um80enBzLVBoX0hZb18zNi1TNmpsTUMtMzhDaFZPUm1HNmNwczhENWdYZ3YzTHZNSmhRTG5VNGpGbWZWNDVzVm5CS3JWQnNidEVpVmh6dWtJZEI5aGVkUWVWcDZrNTJJUk0</guid></item><item><title>他们感染了流感，却从未回家--《纽约时报》 | They Caught the Flu, and Never Came Home - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5PNTlHblk3bGJLMUwyNy03NE9OdXI1YXd5YzhkZE1faGpIN2tRSXVNSEVmb2lQR2RvYmFXYXdrc1J3MnNWQ05hWWFJVllhbmdONW5TNDAtMjZsNG9MWGxzaGRkTmF3MzlLYXkwR2E2SE41cU9oRFRpYTdMQXk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Lauren Caggiano had felt sick for days by the time she tested positive for the flu in an emergency room on a February afternoon.

              &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had your mind blank out while in the middle of something, you’re far from alone. In research published this week, scientists are making the case that mind blanking is a genuine brain phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Belgium, France, and Australia conducted the study, a review of the existing data on mind blanking. They argue that blanking out should be seen and studied as its own state of consciousness, similar to but separate from things like having your mind wander.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors are all experts in consciousness research, and they were inspired to collaborate following a related &lt;a href="https://theassc.org/assc-25/"&gt;annual conference&lt;/a&gt; about three years ago. According to Athena Demertzi, director of the Physiology of Cognition lab at the University of Liège, the topic of mind-blanking isn’t exactly new to some scientists, particularly those studying meditation. But interest in it has also been steadily gathering steam among researchers studying cognition and sleep in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cognitive scientists have begun to recognize that individuals may also experience moments of blankness during wakefulness in their everyday life,” she told Gizmodo in an email. “Meanwhile, in the field of sleep and dreaming research, special categories of dreams, such as so-called ‘white dreams,’ where individuals recall having dreamt but cannot retrieve any content, have drawn increasing attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Demertzi and her colleagues reviewed data from around 80 research papers relevant to mind blanking, which included studies of theirs where they measured people’s brain activity during reported moments of the volunteers having nothing on their mind. And they came to a simple conclusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mind blanking is real, it’s not just a matter of forgetting or a failure to report. At times during the day, our stream of thoughts can simply stop, leaving us with the experience of thinking about nothing,” she said. “In our review, we show that mind blanking is not merely a subjective impression or an illusion. It corresponds to a distinct brain state, one that differs from those associated with the experience of specific mental content.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, mind blanking is linked to its own unique patterns of brain activity. In studies where people were asked to explicitly clear their mind of any thoughts, for instance, brain scans revealed reduced activity in certain regions like the supplementary motor cortex and hippocampus. Data from electroencephalograms (EEG) also indicate that parts of the brain might enter a sleep-like state when we blank out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings, &lt;a href="https://info.cell.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3j3g04/VWTSBN5dMkWyW21PsDn3CCPPjW5SJqyG5vvQybKqQ-3qgyTW7Y8-PT6lZ3nbW2NNdc_60hM20W2b4LGj6Mns1TW3dmd2n98QVkDW7wR_g97wlt9JW7sl7jq9cdNSSN5dgs6b7_bThW1cYQ3L2ntVH0W9dmtl513PBZ5W2rXS_23k8XgVW5H0Krd3PGzMrW63M29y1ZZz97W35SRVN2-HR2xW54QqV95kmkvQVvfrCZ13tLBSW4Zjxtc1jvkLKW9lx5cy6s_-C7W3-sztB6HZXjSW3M6Hw56wF8l8W7TjCxw49RNV9N2LWNbWPhL1vN2TQ9mlmX0KHW7_RQVF6XJs0nW56GSCG1NP__zVvKZF544ZhHdW9krdTd8QSRltW8JvwWx4Cn5T3f4w_K4M04"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, also suggest that people experience mind blanking between 5% and 20% of the time on average. And certain people seem more prone to blanking out than others, such as those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). That said, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to help answer plenty more open questions about the nature of mind blanking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For instance, we don’t yet know how long mind blanking episodes typically last, or whether there are different types. Could some instances be voluntary? Might mind blanking occur during high-performance states, such as flow?” Demertzi noted. “A deeper understanding of its neural mechanisms is also needed. Is mind blanking the result of a failure to generate mental content, or is it a failure of access (where content exists but doesn’t reach conscious awareness)?”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors ultimately hope their work can inspire others in the field to start paying more attention to blanking out. Meanwhile, I just want scientists to one day unravel where exactly in the brain all my intrusive thoughts about my cat come from.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/public-ignorance-apathy-toward-avian-flu-could-threaten-containment" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Not NEARLY enough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can confirm some of this study from my own experiences on Instagram.  People think it is just an agricultural problem and would go away if we banned factory farming.  A lot of people think it is just in America. Or just started a couple of years ago. Many deny that it is at all serious.  And of course there is the oppositional defiant cohort that immediately say it's a hoax, a conspiracy, cooked up by Democrats, made up to sell vaccines, "you lied to us about Covid and we will never trust you again", on and on OMG. I don’t have the skills to detect if any of these are bots, but I fear the attitude is real in a significant number of actual people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/poll-finds-false-measles-claims-gaining-attention-amid-us-outbreaks" target="_blank" title=""&gt;False measles claims are getting a lot of attention.&lt;/a&gt;. Really, social media is a battlefield.  And our alleged HHS secretary is making matters much much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more news you really didn't want to hear, covid viruses remain infective in cadavers of infected mice for up to seven days, depending on temperature of storage. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/mouse-study-suggests-prolonged-post-mortem-sars-cov-2-infectivity" target="_blank"&gt;Compared to only hours or two days for other viruses tested.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vietnam reports a case of H5N1 &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/vietnam-reports-h5n1-avian-flu-case-encephalitis" target="_blank"&gt;manifesting as encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;.  Thus expanding the range of known tissues affected.  But given the neurological symptoms seen in birds and animals, really, this is not surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) today reported four more H5N1 avian flu detections in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt;, three from Idaho and one from California, raising the national total since March 2024 to 1,025 detections from 17 states. Idaho has now reported 65 detections, making it the second most affected state behind California, which has reported 765. The Idaho Department of Agriculture says 25 herds are currently&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agri.idaho.gov/animals/animal-disease/hpai-in-cattle/" target="_blank"&gt;quarantined&lt;/a&gt;, with 16 in Gooding County, 7 in Jerome County, and 2 in Twin Falls County. In poultry&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;developments&lt;/a&gt;, APHIS over the past few days has reported one more H5N1 detection, which involves a live bird market in New York’s Queens County.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring bird migrations are going to spike infections again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Cambridge–based DioSynVax and Singapore's ACM Biolabs have signed a deal to jointly develop a next-generation universal avian flu vaccine with the potential for mucosal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mRNA vaccine targets all major clades of the H5 avian flu subtype and is scalable for rapid, global distribution, according to&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/22/3065588/0/en/Cambridge-s-DIOSynVax-and-Singapore-s-ACM-Biolabs-to-Advance-Pandemic-Ready-Universal-Bird-Flu-Vaccine-with-International-Support.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;from DioSynVax. Delivery via a nasal spray could help increase uptake of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be a game changer. Don't expect our government to get on board with it, but research will go ahead anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Testing of more than 36,000 deer has detected 243 cases of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://mdc.mo.gov/newsroom/mdc-reports-243-new-cases-cwd-found-during-past-year" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;chronic wasting disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(CWD) in 35 Missouri counties—including 7 previously unaffected areas, the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) announced yesterday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long Covid is far more prevalent &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/studies-across-14-nations-show-25-30-rate-long-covid" target="_blank"&gt;than commonly thought.&lt;/a&gt; While many eventually recover, a very significant portion are affected long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/analysis-suggests-covid-19-diminishes-sperm-quality" target="_blank"&gt;diminishes sperm quality&lt;/a&gt;.  Bad news for all those conservative pro-natalists who also hate public health measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/chikungunya/chikungunya-outbreak-spreads-reunion-island" target="_blank"&gt;Chikungunya outbreak spreads on Reunion Island&lt;/a&gt; The last nine months have seen 35,000 cases. This is an insect-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five people and 27 animals &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/tularemia/five-people-27-animals-tested-positive-tularemia-minnesota-last-year" target="_blank"&gt;Were diagnosed with tularemia&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota last year.  While usually tick-borne, this disease can also be contracted by inhalation or handling diseased animals. Some of the patients reported mowing over small dead animals.  Maybe we should mask when mowing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caused by the bacterium&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Francisella tularensis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, tularemia typically affects 200 to 300 people each year in the United States, most often in the central part of the country.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

CIDRAP director Michael Osterholm said it’s intended to safeguard vaccine information, research or access in case the federal government doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our first, second and third choice is to have our federal government do its job,” Osterholm said. “But if that doesn’t happen, there has to be alternative voices out here that are based on the science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cited Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s track record of vaccine skepticism and &lt;a title="" class="apm-link default" data-testid="relativeLink" href="/story/2025/04/16/rfk-jr-mixed-message-about-measles-outbreaks-draws-criticism-from-health-officials"&gt;mixed messaging about the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; amid an outbreak, and a &lt;a class="apm-link null" data-testid="relativeLink" href="/story/2025/04/15/npr-cdc-acip-vaccines-meeting-rfk"&gt;postponed-and-rescheduled meeting&lt;/a&gt; of a federal vaccine advisory group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vaccine Integrity Project is starting with an eight-person steering committee. It’s meeting with a range of vaccine experts, including state health officials, vaccine manufacturers and academics. That group is co-chaired by former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg and health policy researcher Dr. Harvey Fineberg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information-gathering phase will last until early August. Osterholm said speed is important, as federal vaccine policy could change quickly — but he wants to take time to plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do not want to get ahead of our headlights,” Osterholm said. “We’re committed to hearing from all of those who have an important role in the vaccine enterprise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent from that group are current members of federal health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will surely hear messaging from those who work with them, but there’s no one from CDC or FDA that’s involved with the steering committee, or the activities we have right now,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said the project could take a lot of paths, depending on what the steering committee learns. It might establish its own vaccine evaluations, clinical guidelines and research recommendations. It could also review federal decisions and messaging around vaccines and publish its own information, if members see gaps in federal communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project is starting with a $240,000 grant from Alumbra, a foundation established by billionaire Christy Walton. Osterholm said the project will seek additional funding depending on its next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm said it’s an approach he wouldn’t have imagined taking until the Trump administration took office. But he said experts want reassurance vaccine information will stay stable — reassurance they’re not getting from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to know what is going to happen the next day in public health,” Osterholm said. “We have to be open to whatever could come down the pike, and it’s going to be challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MPR News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOZ2FQTS1SWUNTTUxBUVctWjVjNmc4VURRUHBtMXRVaHNkdU1hVlp2OVByTjlRcWh6eXpxWTA5MUFFZ3A4dUhQU21PTlVUdHFBQ05LNzY2eUg4dlZSQ3B3bmExV2xGTHp6X1lPQkdqSG9hdXNTNE00ejFtQ25WVXVuTU95emYxWnFSRXVUMHR4MVI2ZXBkaW8yUUxiUThGTHJ3cnBHQnktOHdnR00</guid></item><item><title>挥之不去的细菌碎片可能导致治疗后莱姆病症状-神经科学新闻 | Lingering Bacterial Debris May Drive Post-Treatment Lyme Symptoms - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE16ZVBQMlVvcW1yMzhZS0lHTW4wUHJISE1kVEhEcWR0WnVHcFVzR0FDdWFubUMzX3NIWV9wdVNpRl9nMzRqdnRGNWhVV1dCcTFobUxQMzNZMlBWd1UyckJsMDA5ai1DYVNnVFZPa0dKeV8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research suggests that lingering cell wall fragments from the Lyme disease bacterium, &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, may be responsible for persistent symptoms long after antibiotic treatment. These fragments, made of a unique form of peptidoglycan, appear to accumulate in the liver and joints, triggering inflammation and immune responses even after the infection is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism resembles theories behind long COVID, where the immune system reacts to residual viral components. The findings could pave the way for targeted treatments and diagnostic tools that focus on inflammation rather than active infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Debris:&lt;/strong&gt; Lyme bacteria’s unique peptidoglycan can linger for months post-treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; These remnants may drive ongoing symptoms like joint pain and fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Targets:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers are exploring monoclonal antibodies to neutralize the leftover molecules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms that persist long after Lyme disease is treated are not uncommon — a 2022 study found that 14% of patients who were diagnosed and treated early with antibiotic therapy would still develop Post Treatment Lyme Disease (PTLD). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet doctors puzzle over the condition’s causes and how to help their patients through symptoms ranging from severe fatigue and cognitive challenges to body pain and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Northwestern University scientists believe they know what causes the treated infection to mimic chronic illness: the body may be responding to remnants of the &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; (the bacteria that causes Lyme) cell wall, which breaks down during treatment yet lingers in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matches one theory behind the underlying causes of long COVID-19 in that persisting viral molecules may encourage a strong, albeit unnecessary, immune response, said bacteriologist Brandon L. Jutras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lyme and long COVID-19 are clearly vastly different diseases, but it’s possible that they share a more general mechanism of inappropriate inflammation caused by remnants of a previous infection,” said Jutras, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The maladaptive response is a product of an infection, but perhaps not necessarily an active one in all cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peptidoglycan is a structural feature of virtually all bacterial cells and a common target of antibiotics, including penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, to be published April 23 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, tracked the biodistribution of peptidoglycan from different bacteria, in real time, and found that all cell wall material is rapidly shed, but Lyme disease’s peptidoglycan persists for weeks to months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme arthritis is one of the more common long-term impacts of exposure to Lyme. If a patient has a swollen knee, for instance, it is full of synovial fluid, a natural lubricant found in joints. Jutras said his team looked at the fluid in humans and found that pieces of the peptidoglycan were omnipresent weeks to months after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the context of Lyme arthritis, if you give patients anti-inflammatory, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, they get better,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of these very same patients do not get better after oral and IV antibiotics, which implies there is something unique about how patients respond at a genetic level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jutras, who joined Northwestern faculty last summer, is an associate professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a member of the Center for Human Immunobiology at Northwestern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has been studying Lyme disease for more than 15 years, beginning in graduate school, and was previously an associate professor at Virginia Tech University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peptidoglycan is kind of like a structural skeleton in virtually all bacteria, acting as a big protective bag for the bacterium,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Penicillin and amoxicillin and dozens of other drugs target peptidoglycan synthesis because it’s a molecule that is specific to bacteria, it has similar structural features across the kingdom, and it’s essential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme’s peptidoglycan, however, is structurally unique, and this difference may be behind its persistence in humans. Instead of looking the same as with other bacteria, the Lyme peptidoglycan is fundamentally distinct, which is facilitated in part by sucking up sugars from its tick vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon bacterial cell death — by antibiotics or the immune system — surviving molecules tend to relocate to the liver, which can’t process the modified peptidoglycan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this modification, it seems likely that the peptidoglycan would clear right away, as in other infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unusual chemical properties of Borrelia peptidoglycan promote persistence, but it’s the individual patient response to the molecule that likely impacts the overall clinical outcome,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some patients will have a more robust or stronger immune response, which could result in a worse disease outcome, while the immune system of others may largely ignore the molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, in essence, it’s not about whether the molecule is there or not, it’s more about how an individual responds to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jutras hopes the groundbreaking findings will lead to development of more accurate tests, possibly for PTLD patients, and refined treatment options when antibiotics have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively stymie PTLD, instead of neutralizing an infection that may no longer exist, efforts are underway to neutralize the inflammatory molecule, including weaponizing monoclonal antibodies to target peptidoglycan for destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R21AI159800, R01AI173256, R01AI178711), the Steven &amp;amp; Alexandra Cohen Foundation, the Department of Defense (TB220039), the Global Lyme Alliance and the Bay Area Lyme Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology and Lyme disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b2722272a65392e322524272f380b2524393f233c2e383f2e3925652e2f3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Win Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Win Reynolds – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr2955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The peptidoglycan of &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; can persist in discrete tissues and cause systemic responses consistent with chronic illness&lt;/a&gt;” by Brandon L.

One possible scenario involves the persistence of lingering antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have previously reported that patients with postinfectious Lyme arthritis often harbor the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall of &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, the Lyme disease agent, in the synovial fluid of their inflamed joints after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not yet known how &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG persists, in what form, or if it may play a role in other postinfectious complications after Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a murine model, we developed a real-time in vivo system to track &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG as a function of cell wall chemistry and validated our findings using both molecular and cellular approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike typical bacterial PG, the unique chemical properties of polymeric &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG drive murine liver accumulation, where the cell wall material persists for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kupffer cells and hepatocytes phagocytose and retain &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG and, although liver occupancy coincides with minimal pathology, both organ-specific and secreted protein profiles produced under these conditions bear some similarities to reported proteins enriched in patients with chronic illness after acute infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, transcriptomic profiling indicated that &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG affects energy metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how a pathogenic molecule can persist after agent clearance, potentially contributing to illness after infection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:59:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE16ZVBQMlVvcW1yMzhZS0lHTW4wUHJISE1kVEhEcWR0WnVHcFVzR0FDdWFubUMzX3NIWV9wdVNpRl9nMzRqdnRGNWhVV1dCcTFobUxQMzNZMlBWd1UyckJsMDA5ai1DYVNnVFZPa0dKeV8</guid></item><item><title>它曾经在美国被消灭，现在，我们可能处于流行病的边缘。-石板 | It Was Once Eliminated From the U.S. Now, We Could Be on the Verge of an Epidemic. - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxObWhSSDUzSGU2am1ET3V3cFJKbVBlN1NoRVFYdmFrRXJONTlvR1EtMWxwcHJoQWNtVXBqeDZJUlNOVmtEaV9lWl84OUJzRmU2OGFMMlZOb1RyenVFbzE5X2wyOTY1eWYtUlpCckhPY241aHY3Q29CVkpUbE1rRVljMGt3SWxVUzdmR1RN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9uazbjf0012unm4pp2fgf3p@published"&gt;As of this week, there are at least &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/us-measles-total-climbs-800-cases-10-outbreaks"&gt;800 cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the U.S. across 25 states. There are 10 outbreaks—defined as three or more related cases—ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;New Mexico to New York&lt;/a&gt;. The largest outbreak, with 597 cases, started in Texas back in January. That’s where we had the first death of an unvaccinated child, in February. Another in April. Three in total. Before this year, there had been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/measles-third-death-new-normal/"&gt;three deaths&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the years since the U.S. eliminated the disease (meaning that the disease was no longer continuously spreading) in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb4001j3b75czf1c06t@published"&gt;It’s concerning. The numbers are high, especially considering we’re less than halfway through the year. It’s very possible that &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/third-measles-death"&gt;cases are being underreported&lt;/a&gt;. And they keep rising, with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00786-w"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it will slow anytime soon. Which leads us to the million-dollar question: How bad could measles get this year?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001k3b75whtg35o0@published"&gt;While it’s impossible to say for certain, experts say that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/measles-epidemic-texas.html"&gt;we’re standing on a precipice&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not out of the question that measles could rip through the entire country like wildfire. If each case is a spark, “the brush is burning right now,” says epidemiologist Michael Mina, who studies how infections and vaccines affect human health. Whether the burning brush will ignite the whole forest just depends on how long our strained firewalls can hold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001l3b752lp8jc5q@published"&gt;Measles could continue breaking out in these bubbles (bad, but relatively confined to certain geographic areas). Or, if those bubbles grow large enough, they could converge and turn into a countrywide epidemic (very, very bad). To imagine &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; bad it could get, we can look to Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/measles-epidemic-texas.html"&gt;Mina recently argued in a New York Times op-ed&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the continent saw more than 80,000 cases, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and over 70 deaths, Mina says, including in countries that had achieved—and subsequently lost—elimination status. That’s possible here, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="176" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001m3b75xna6519c@published"&gt;If it feels like this is happening suddenly, it’s not. The U.S. has been moving toward this moment for decades, says Mina, long &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health secretary&lt;/a&gt;. There are a mix of factors. For one, public health is often a victim of its own success: Once a disease has been wiped out for long enough, people forget how bad it was. In the days before the measles vaccine (aka the MMR vaccine), almost every kid got measles, says &lt;a href="https://shea-online.org/dr-david-weber-named-incoming-president-of-the-society-for-healthcare-epidemiology-of-america/"&gt;David Weber&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. Every year 3 million to 4 million people were infected; nearly 50,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;were hospitalized&lt;/a&gt;; hundreds died. The vaccine changed that. Those who survived the disease decades ago might protest, &lt;em&gt;Hey, I had the measles and just stayed home for a week, no biggie!&lt;/em&gt; People forget how many people died, says Weber. Not to mention, there are new parents today who never had to deal with the measles at all. For many, the idea of their kid getting the measles feels totally theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001n3b7545v6mxq4@published"&gt;The consequence of improved public health is that it becomes harder to convince people to go out of their way to vaccinate. Vaccination has always been hard to argue for; sticking a child with a needle full of some substance “goes against a parent’s natural evolutionary instincts,” says Mina. He doesn’t fault parents who worry about vaccination. Instead, he says, it’s the onus of public health officials to make sure parents are “exceedingly comfortable” to push back against those (totally reasonable!) instincts and make an informed decision to protect their child. That requires making sure parents have the information they need to evaluate the risks and benefits of a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb6001o3b75krhct2ix@published"&gt;Vaccine messaging by public health officials has left much to be desired, says Mina. Instead of acknowledging and addressing parents’ worries, they’ve taken a more paternalistic approach—i.e., “Just get the vaccine, it’ll be fine!” Then, early on in the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assured people that you couldn’t get COVID-19 after getting vaccinated, when you &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;in fact still get COVID-19, albeit a much milder version. People felt like they’d been lied to, recalls &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/about-us"&gt;Jess Steier&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the public health data science consulting firm (and &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/podcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;) Unbiased Science. “They burned the bridge of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb6001p3b75pq7l21nn@published"&gt;Add all that to the fact that the MMR vaccine has been erroneously linked to autism (studies continue to show &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-on-vaccines-and-autism"&gt;no association between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;). The seed was planted way back in 1998 thanks to a paper in the Lancet—a paper that was later found to be riddled with faulty data and has since been retracted. But that didn’t matter. It had already set off a movement, fanned by RFK Jr. and other &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/opinion/rfk-jr-is-a-vaccine-cynic.html"&gt;vaccine cynics&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, measles vaccination rates had been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;dropping for many years&lt;/a&gt; before the pandemic came along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001q3b75o8hbhq61@published"&gt;And we really need people to get the vaccine. Measles is incredibly contagious, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00786-w"&gt;far more so than COVID or flu&lt;/a&gt;. A single person with measles can walk through, say, a grocery store and continue to infect people for up to two hours after they’ve left the space, says Weber. Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of unvaccinated people exposed to measles will become infected.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001r3b75xnq2o75a@published"&gt;While measles’ mortality rate is relatively low compared with other diseases—about 0.2 percent of people infected with measles in the U.S. will die—the hospitalization rate is incredibly high: 20 percent, for people who haven’t been vaccinated. “This is not a benign disease,” says Weber. “How many infectious diseases do we have that 10 to 20 percent of the people end up in the hospital?” (It’s certainly not that high for flu, COVID, or other respiratory illnesses.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001s3b75jp4hxip7@published"&gt;All that being said, here’s the very &lt;em&gt;worst-&lt;/em&gt;case scenario for what could happen next with measles, according to Steier’s calculations. Given measles’ mortality rate of 0.2 percent, if the &lt;em&gt;entire &lt;/em&gt;unvaccinated U.S. population (23.5 million people) were exposed to measles, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIEM3qQuFTC/?img_index=3"&gt;nearly 50,000&lt;/a&gt; people could die. (This would likely occur over several years.) Given that 90 percent of exposed unvaccinated people become infected, and then 20 percent of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; number face hospitalization, millions could end up in the hospital, and some with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857"&gt;potentially lifelong complications&lt;/a&gt;, including neurological damage, intellectual disabilities, and hearing loss. They also face the risk of something called &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;, where the immune system “forgets” its immunity to other infectious diseases for a period of weeks to years. Even if they survive the measles, they could suffer or die from something else &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;they got the measles. None of these calculations include the 22 million immunocompromised Americans who face heightened risk even if they were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001t3b75nyt9nq44@published"&gt;It’s unclear what a nationwide outbreak would mean for the vaccinated population, says Steier. The MMR vaccine is &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-outbreak-vaccine-booster-titers.html"&gt;incredibly effective&lt;/a&gt;—roughly 97 percent of people are protected with two shots—but it’s not been tested in an environment where there are thousands of cases. “We could see more breakthrough cases of measles, potentially,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001u3b75iv1ypjlv@published"&gt;It might also change how we live our lives. Like COVID days, we could see travel advisories or requirements to carry proof of immunity (which could cause procedural challenges, considering how many people are immune due to prior infection and thus have no vaccination records to prove their immunity, says Weber). This, of course, will depend on how the federal government responds.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001v3b75hz2r3mw5@published"&gt;Again, those are worst-case scenarios. How exactly measles will play out isn’t certain. But the way forward is clear, experts say: The only thing that can end the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine, full stop. That’s our firewall. In the current outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;96 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; who have been infected are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. In the case of a measles infection, which can take days to develop symptoms, even a vaccination right before an individual gets exposed and infected can still make a difference in protecting them. That means “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/essential-programme-on-immunization/implementation/catch-up-vaccination"&gt;catch-up&lt;/a&gt;” vaccination campaigns can be “very, very powerful” if an unvaccinated community gets hit hard with measles, says Mina. In other words, there are things that can be done late in the game, even if we cross into wildfire territory.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001w3b75cnk8nlfq@published"&gt;Alas, we continue to see mixed messaging about vaccines by the Department of Health and Human Services. In the past, kids dying of measles might have led to swift action by the CDC, such as widespread catch-up vaccination campaigns (some CDC employees &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-measles-cases-missed-texas-us-rfkjr-rcna201426"&gt;have been deployed&lt;/a&gt; to Texas, though resources are low after federal funding cuts last month). But even after the first child’s death in February, RFK Jr. continued to question the MMR vaccine and tout therapies, like vitamin A, that &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-rfk-jr-vitamin-a-research-vaccination-nutrition-debunk.html"&gt;are not preventive measures&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t until early April that he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury"&gt;finally endorsed the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. And yet “the only way that we can prevent measles is MMR,” says Steier. “It’s bananas that we’re talking about anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001x3b753sezczft@published"&gt;The good news is that, regardless of lagging federal efforts, individuals can opt to protect themselves &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-outbreak-vaccine-booster-titers.html"&gt;with a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that is incredibly effective. If you’re in an outbreak area or planning to travel, make sure you and your children are vaccinated, says Weber. Infants can receive an early vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-vaccine-can-young-children-get-early-dose-mmr-shot-rcna198038"&gt;at 6 months&lt;/a&gt; (this would not be considered to be one of the standard doses, so they’d later still need the full two-shot regimen). As the threat has grown more imminent, “we are seeing an increased awareness amongst millions of people,” notes Mina. Hopefully many of them will update their risk-benefit analysis and get vaccinated, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001y3b7581wzrae7@published"&gt;In the meantime, experts are keeping an eye out for red flags that we’re going the wrong way. If outbreak bubbles continue to grow—or worse, converge—we move closer toward a national epidemic, Mina says. Steier worries about a study that RFK Jr. has ordered to investigate the link between autism and vaccines, which will be headed by &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/dc-warns-major-measles-exposure-hhs-names-geier-study-autism-and-vaccines"&gt;David Geier&lt;/a&gt;, a man who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;has been disciplined for practicing medicine without a license&lt;/a&gt;, has no advanced science degree, and has suggested for decades that vaccines cause autism. If the study claims to find a link (again, the existence of such a link has already been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;investigated thoroughly and disproven&lt;/a&gt;), Steier anticipates that vaccination rates could plunge—the opposite of what needs to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001z3b75p1dbjwoo@published"&gt;Until vaccination rates improve, we’ll teeter on the edge with this disease. It’s not clear what will happen with measles next—but we’re not in a good &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;spot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis, based on nearly two million people, showed that the more components of metabolic syndrome a person had, the greater their dementia risk, with women and those in their 40s being most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study does not prove causation, it highlights the importance of managing cardiovascular and metabolic health during midlife. Preventive lifestyle changes could play a key role in reducing early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s and Vascular Dementia:&lt;/strong&gt; Metabolic syndrome was linked to both major dementia subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70% Risk Increase:&lt;/strong&gt; People with all five components of metabolic syndrome had a 70% higher risk of young-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex and Age Disparity:&lt;/strong&gt; Women and individuals in their 40s faced the highest increased risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a larger waistline, high blood pressure and other risk factors that make up metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia, according to a study published on April 23, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young-onset dementia is diagnosed before the age of 65. The study does not prove that metabolic syndrome causes young-onset dementia, it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic syndrome is defined as having excess belly fat plus two or more of the following risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood sugar, higher than normal triglycerides, which are a type of fat found in the blood, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or “good” cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most dementia is diagnosed in older age, young-onset dementia occurs while a person is still working and perhaps raising a family,” said study author Minwoo Lee, MD, PhD, of Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in Anyang, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our study found having metabolic syndrome in middle age is a risk factor for young-onset dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers reviewed national health insurance data in South Korea to identify nearly two million people between the ages of 40 and 60 who had a health check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The check-up included measurements of waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Of all participants, 25% had metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over an average follow-up period of eight years, 8,921 people, or 0.45% of all participants, developed dementia. For those with metabolic syndrome, the incidence rate was 0.86 cases per 1,000 person-years, compared to 0.49 cases for those without metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person-years represent both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, education and health factors such as level of physical activity, depression and stroke, researchers found metabolic syndrome was associated with a 24% higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific types of dementia, it was associated with a 12% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 21% increased risk of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found female participants with metabolic syndrome had a 34% increased risk of dementia compared to male participants who had a 15% increased risk. People in their 40s had a greater risk than people in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found each component of metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of dementia, which was cumulative. People with all five components had a 70% increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and reducing stress, may help reduce the risk of young-onset dementia,” said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research that follows people over longer periods of time and uses brain scans to look for biomarkers of dementia is needed to confirm and expand upon our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that researchers did not review genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Korean National Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this metabolism and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b6bbb7b6aab9bc98b9b9b6f6bbb7b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:56:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5YNk4wS3poV0c4d0tTQl9UZXZRQ1A2Y2k5cXViVjJhaHlNRHJfakFVZUh6X0FNLXRVMlNXOXFoWDBGTUEwUTlCbG11enBJOGx0RkZocUFtR1NUdXBCVXhpNUMtWFlPUVdLRjNaLVJLZUI</guid></item><item><title>太多的嗡嗡声？日常咖啡因的隐藏风险- SciTechDaily | Too Much Buzz?
