For instance, instead of burning calories, brown fat could help &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2216435119" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;to improve metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; – the body’s ability to process and use energy from food effectively. People who have poor metabolic health are unable to clear glucose from their blood quickly, raising their risk of type 2 diabetes. Brown fat could act simply by taking up glucose from the bloodstream, or by secreting hormones that act on other tissues to regulate insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"In terms of whole-body energy expenditure, it [brown fat] probably does not play as large of a role in humans as it does in mice," says Cohen. "So my personal feeling, based on the data, is that brown fat activation is not going to be a good means to treat obesity or to lose significant amounts of weight." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"However, the data is much stronger to suggest that activating brown fat might lower glucose levels and improve metabolic health. So, I think if there is going to be a therapeutic side to this, it's much more likely going to be in treating the complications of obesity and ageing than in treating obesity per se."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 faEbjU"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 ejktow"&gt;The shock of cold-water immersion causes the body to think it's in danger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But how can we activate brown fat, and harness the superpowers it may – or may not – contain? One way is to expose yourself to cold, as uncomfortable as it may be. Think ice baths, cold water swimming, or cryotherapy chambers – a specialised device that exposes the body to extremely low temperatures for one to three minutes to promote healing and wellness. The shock of cold-water immersion causes the body to think it's in danger, activating the fight-or-flight response. This releases the neurotransmitter noradrenalin, which binds to and "activates" brown fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOajZuN2h4MjBvaUFJZ25lNmNKU2steGpQS2M0Qk50OGZaVEdta0duTEJwWWJ1a056X2FFbGZ1My1MMURHNVN1UWtSQnAzWGYtNzM0bWdYR3R3QUk3M0ZlTlRwSUVaRkVwUUN6aXF4ZDljSV9vQk9Ta1NZRkl5akFKVXlrMHVLUDJoQTNzSlBQanluRGlKWC1SbUs5NUs2c3FYbHpVVTYyS0MtS2dlUTdmYW5NRTVDQQ</guid></item><item><title>学校的疫苗接种率引起了家长、医疗专业人员的关注- TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://triblive.com/local/valley-news-dispatch/vaccination-rates-in-schools-cause-concern-for-parents-medical-professionals/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storyContent"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucas James relies on others to be vaccinated because, for now, he can’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-editorial"&gt;A leukemia patient and stem cell transplant recipient, Lucas, 16, of Hempfield receives intravenous antibody treatments to help him rebuild his immune system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-editorial"&gt;“(Doctors) said he may never be able to be vaccinated again if his body doesn’t stop needing these transfusions,” said his mother, Megan James.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-editorial"&gt;Lucas is among the growing number of school-age children who, for one reason or another, are not being vaccinated against preventable diseases. Some, like Lucas, may be unvaccinated for medical reasons. Others might be because of religious beliefs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-editorial"&gt;The trend is causing concern among medical professionals — and affecting the population’s herd immunity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pennsylvania, students in kindergarten are required to have four doses of the vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; four doses of the polio vaccine; two doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR); three doses of hepatitis B; and two doses of the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students also can provide evidence of immunity, such as proof they’ve already had and recovered from a disease such as chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the vaccinations, students must apply for an exemption. Increasingly, more parents or guardians are doing just that. Students in Pennsylvania also can be declared exempt from vaccines for religious or philosophical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 1,800 students in Allegheny County submitted medical, religious or philosophical vaccination exemptions in 2024, compared with about 1,300 in 2020, a 38% increase, according to figures from the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Westmoreland County saw an even bigger jump — about 130% — with 926 students filing for exemptions in 2024, compared with just under 400 in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous reasons a child is unable to be vaccinated, including that they have weakened immune systems, are on chemotherapy or had an allergic reaction to a vaccine, said Dr. Joseph Aracri, system chair of pediatrics with Allegheny Health Network Pediatric Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone like Lucas relies on herd immunity to remain illness-free. Herd immunity is when a disease has little chance of spreading within a population because people are resistant to it, either from having the disease and recovering or, more commonly, because they have been vaccinated against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a nonissue for many diseases, herd immunity is coming back into question for some diseases, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data shows school-age children in several Western Pennsylvania counties below herd immunity levels for some diseases, including measles, mumps and rubella. Allegheny, Westmoreland, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana and Beaver counties report vaccination rates for kindergarten-age children for the MMR vaccine are below the 95% threshold for herd immunity, according to 2024 data from the &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/health/programs/immunizations/rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can be concerning for someone like Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’d be very vulnerable if he were exposed to someone with a virus,” his mother said. “It would be very likely that he would catch something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things like the measles are really scary for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sophomore at Hempfield Area Senior High School, Lucas was diagnosed with leukemia in January 2022. After two years of treatments, doctors thought the cancer had gone into remission, but it returned in January 2024, just days after he had finished a course of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June 2024, Lucas underwent a blood-making bone marrow stem cell transplant. The procedure left his immune system vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Lucas attends school in-person, he wears a mask to protect himself. Megan James said that if Hempfield’s vaccination rates drop, Lucas would need to be pulled out of school again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating,” James said. “He’s been through enough. We shouldn’t have to isolate him because of misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither federal nor state health agencies track how many students are fully up to schedule for all vaccines; they instead track the student population by individual vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas’ doctors are keeping an eye on outbreaks and will notify her if it becomes dangerous, James said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things that most kids can fight off, his body wouldn’t be able to fight back,” she said. “It’s scary times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Growing hesitancy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy has become a growing trend thanks, in part, to the covid-19 pandemic and skepticism surrounding the covid vaccine, Aracri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can easily fall victim to misinformation about vaccines on social media, said Barbara Nightingale, deputy director for clinical services with the Allegheny County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are not surprised by the decline (in vaccination rates), since vaccine hesitancy has been growing across the U.S. and globally for the past decade,” Nightingale said. “Because vaccine misinformation feeds off fear, it can spread easily, particularly as more residents receive health information from social media.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recommends residents speak with their health care provider if they have any concerns about the effects or safety of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aracri said this is the second time in his career he has seen a trending decrease in vaccination rates. The first time was in the late 1990s when a paper by an English anti-vaccine activist and former surgeon falsely claimed a link between the MMR vaccine and bowel disease and autism, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Aracri is seeing what he calls hesitancy from parents rather than resistance in regard to vaccinating their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that this time around what we’re seeing is just more questions and more of an understanding,” Aracri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The covid pandemic was a major culprit and particularly damaging from a vaccine acceptance standpoint, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(People were) being forced to get a covid shot, and the covid shot was supposed to bring an end to the pandemic,” Aracri said. “And we found out that, while it really didn’t — it protected those of our most vulnerable — but it didn’t necessarily prevent the spread or end the covid pandemic anytime sooner. So whenever you give a child a shot and they still end up getting covid, that makes you doubt the other things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, combined with political unrest, has created uncertainty, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People have access to all kinds of unedited information that’s out there,” Aracri said. “Our job is to be able to, first, be aware of all misinformation, disinformation or whatever you want to call it, and be able to have that conversation and discuss with the patient the benefits of being vaccinated as opposed to the risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem: No vaccine is 100% effective for 100% of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different vaccines have different levels of effectiveness, Aracri said. The MMR vaccine is about 98% effective, he said, while other vaccines such as the flu shot — a seasonal vaccine — can be anywhere from 40% to 75% effective each year because the flu virus constantly mutates. He emphasized the importance for providers to counsel patients and parents when they have questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;In-school concerns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darcy Lutz has been a nurse at Shaler Area High School for the past six years. She said her job involves two main responsibilities regarding student vaccinations: making sure the school, parents and students are in compliance with Pennsylvania school health laws and providing accurate information about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutz called the dropping vaccination rates concerning. Although, she said, the district’s percentages haven’t dropped from last school year, education about vaccines is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not here to fight with people about their strongly held beliefs,” Lutz said. “If people have questions, we’re always here to talk and educate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaler Area has a 97% MMR vaccination rate, but because the disease is so contagious, an outbreak could occur if that were to fall as little as 2%, Lutz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most vulnerable populations really rely on herd immunity,” she said. “When we see those rates dip, it really is dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her nine years as a school nurse, Lutz said, she has encountered various reasons children go unvaccinated. The biggest factor is access to health care, she said. Some families have no insurance or don’t have reliable transportation to get to a doctor. There’s also a rising immigrant and refugee population in the district, and some of those families are still working to catch up with the required vaccine schedule, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district has brought Allegheny County’s mobile health clinic to its schools to give families direct access to health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also cited two other reasons for parents deciding not to vaccinate their children: misinformation and feeling as though their freedoms are being threatened when they’re told it’s required by law to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="neFMT neFMT_body-subhead"&gt;Disease resurgence &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aracri pointed to a recent outbreak of the measles in Texas as an example of how a disease can reemerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said a large population was unvaccinated, falling below herd immunity levels, and it caused an outbreak. It grew to be the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. in more than 30 years, with about 760 confirmed cases in Texas by August. The outbreak resulted in 99 hospitalizations and the deaths of two unvaccinated school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nightingale said residents should know that many people are vaccinated against diseases that once were common and caused serious illness or death. For example, the polio vaccine, developed by Jonas Salk at the University of Pittsburgh and widely distributed during the 1950s, has brought down cases of polio worldwide by more than 99%, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All vaccines play an important role in saving lives, reducing disease and creating a healthy community,” Nightingale said. “This role is increasingly important when school-age children are involved, as their immune system is not completely developed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nightingale said that if rates continue to drop, communities are at a higher risk of a resurgence of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is especially important for residents to remember that, like any medical intervention, vaccines carry some risks,” she said, “but for most people the risk of the disease is far greater.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikx2l81009a2cp74hfz6hf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A senior Food and Drug Administration official on Friday said the agency will change its vaccine approval process, alleging that Covid-19 vaccination resulted in the deaths of 10 children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikx2n2200003b6noldw3bmg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an internal memo obtained by CNN, Dr. Vinay Prasad — the FDA’s chief medical and scientific officer and the director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research — claimed, “Healthy young children who faced tremendously low risk of death were coerced, at the behest of the Biden administration, via school and work mandates, to receive a vaccine that could result in death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikxo0j4000g3b6nutfjg8xc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prasad did not provide details about the deaths or how the FDA came to that conclusion, but pointed to “an initial analysis” that examined 96 deaths and linked 10 to the Covid-19 vaccination. He also claimed that Covid-19 “was never highly lethal for children” and that the effects of it “are comparable” to respiratory viruses for which there aren’t annual vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiky5zie000q3b6n97g5x3qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I have no doubt that many vaccines have saved millions of lives globally, and many have benefits that far exceed risks, but vaccines are like any other medical product,” Prasad said. “The right drug given to the right patient at the right time is great, but the same drug can be inappropriately given, causing harm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikynt8500173b6ngyun33t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prasad said as a result of the FDA analysis, the agency will adopt a new approval process for vaccines that will require more evidence of their safety and value before they can be marketed. Among the changes would be stricter requirements for authorization of vaccines used for pregnant women and trials for pneumonia vaccines that will need to prove the shots reduce disease, instead of showing that the vaccine produces enough antibodies to fight the illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmil6rl9o00073b6n0kw2yyh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency will also “revise the annual flu vaccine framework,” Prasad said, and “will re-appraise safety and be honest in vaccine labels.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmil6rl9o00083b6nvor6u3gc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although Prasad’s memo didn’t provide details about how the process would change, it could require larger studies that take longer to complete, slowing the process significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmil6rl9o000a3b6na54yg9ud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the memo, Prasad said he’s open to discussion about the changes but said such debates should be internal to the FDA. “Some staff may not agree with these core principles and operating principles,” he wrote before urging those staffers to submit their resignation letters.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikzf4lp001f3b6nhxj5ptfg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN has reached out to the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the agency, for comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikxfu6m00073b6nlf5epcj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Friday’s memo is in line with arguments long made by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has repeatedly raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines and previously founded the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmikxmx4h000d3b6n7fvskklw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the HHS secretary, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/05/health/hhs-slashes-funding-for-mrna-vaccine-development"&gt;slashed funding&lt;/a&gt; for mRNA vaccine development, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;removed all members&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine advisory committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/kennedy-cdc-vaccine-guidance"&gt;directed the CDC&lt;/a&gt; to change its website to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/20/health/cdc-website-autism-vaccines"&gt;include false claims&lt;/a&gt; that link autism and vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, handpicked by Kennedy, is set to meet next week to discuss the childhood vaccine schedule and the timing of the hepatitis B vaccine, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt; of the meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmil6o3v300003b6nmow3ot93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For more than 30 years, the first in the series of hepatitis B shots has been recommended for infants shortly after birth — a strategy that nearly eradicated the potentially fatal disease among children in the US. Although there is no new evidence about the vaccine’s safety or effectiveness, the new advisory panel has been considering whether to delay the first shots by months or years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The scars you carried as a child can quietly resurface years later, often without you even realising it. For many adults, the impact of painful childhood experiences is evident in their everyday lives, showing up in unexpected ways. In a video shared on Instagram, Dr Judith Joseph, a board-certified psychiatrist trained at Columbia University, New York Presbyterian Hospital, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, explains how childhood trauma can manifest in adulthood. Here are six signs of childhood trauma affecting your adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding childhood trauma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood trauma is much more serious than you imagine. It may have a long-term impact on your mental wellness. As children, developing brains adapt to survive in threatening environments. Though these survival mechanisms can be protective in early stages, they can persist into adulthood and create challenges in everyday situations. Dr Joseph also noted that the trauma response goes beyond the commonly discussed fight-or-flight reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Is Slapping Your Child Normal? | Abhijit Iyer Mitra on Parenting Myths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fight and flight are not the only symptoms related to PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). Other trauma reactions include Fawn and Freeze. There are over 20 symptoms of PTSD, and if you don’t display the most common ones, a diagnosis may be overlooked,” the psychiatrist said. The main categories of PTSD are intrusion symptoms, avoidance behaviours, changes in cognition and mood, and physical reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every traumatic event necessarily leads to PTSD. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, about one half of all US adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lives, but &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;most do not develop PTSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by researchers at the University of Georgia, published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Development and Psychopathology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, found that adverse experiences and environments in childhood may cause &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/development-and-psychopathology/article/childhood-exposure-to-danger-increases-black-youths-alcohol-consumption-accelerated-aging-and-cardiac-risk-as-young-adults-a-test-of-the-incubation-hypothesis/3ADBB433F09D44CCCB469D9ABF4A4FCE" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a chain reaction of mental and physical health problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; later in life. “Things that happen to you in childhood, from how you’re raised as a child to the environment that you’re in, can lead to long-standing issues,” said Sierra Carter, co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6 ways childhood trauma shows up in adult life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s take a look at how childhood trauma manifests in adulthood.

It can affect your everyday life and even your relationships. A 2025 study by Penn State researchers found that people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms often have &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39673913/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;trouble communicating and resolving relationship difficulties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; with their romantic partners.

			&lt;p&gt;Most of us think of orange juice as a simple breakfast habit, something you pour without much thought. Yet scientists are discovering that this everyday drink may be doing far more in the body than quenching thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has shown that regular orange juice consumption can influence the activity of thousands of genes inside our immune cells. Many of these genes help control blood pressure, calm inflammation, and manage the way the body processes sugar, all of which play an important role in long-term &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/heart-health-60216"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mnfr.70299"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt; followed adults who drank 500ml of pure pasteurised orange juice every day for two months. After 60 days, many genes associated with inflammation and higher blood pressure had become less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cortisol-cocktails-are-the-latest-stress-busting-trend-heres-the-science"&gt;'Cortisol Cocktails' Are The Latest Stress-Busting Trend. Here's The Science.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included NAMPT, IL6, IL1B and NLRP3, which usually switch on when the body is under stress. Another gene known as SGK1, which affects the kidneys' ability to hold onto sodium (salt), also became less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such changes match &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319862089_Health_Benefits_of_Orange_Juice_and_Citrus_Flavonoids_Applications_in_Functional_Foods"&gt;previous findings&lt;/a&gt; that daily orange juice drinking can reduce blood pressure in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is noteworthy because it offers a possible explanation for why orange juice has been linked to better heart health &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2020.1865263"&gt;in several trials&lt;/a&gt;. The new work shows that the drink does not simply raise blood sugar. Instead, it appears to trigger small shifts in the body's regulatory systems that reduce inflammation and help blood vessels relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural compounds in oranges, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7284956/"&gt;particularly hesperidin&lt;/a&gt;, a citrus flavonoid known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, seem to influence processes related to high blood pressure, cholesterol balance and the way the body handles sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183296" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/orange_juice_642.jpg" alt="oranges and orange juice" class="wp-image-183296 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/orange_juice_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/orange_juice_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183296" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Compounds in oranges affect pathways linked with high blood pressure. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADaqPcktq0/"&gt;La_Cruz/Getty Images Pro/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response also varies by body size. People carrying more weight tended to show greater changes in genes involved in fat metabolism, while leaner volunteers showed stronger effects on inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34060162/"&gt;systematic review of controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; involving 639 participants from 15 studies found that regular orange juice consumption lowered insulin resistance and blood cholesterol levels. Insulin resistance is a key feature of pre- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="183269" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and high cholesterol is an established risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36383179/"&gt;Another analysis&lt;/a&gt; focusing on overweight and obese adults found small reductions in systolic blood pressure and increases in &lt;a href="https://labtestsonline.org.uk/tests/hdl-cholesterol-test"&gt;high-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt; (HDL), often called the good cholesterol, after several weeks of daily orange juice consumption. Although these changes are modest, even slight improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol can make a meaningful difference when maintained over many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More clues come from studies that examine metabolites, the tiny molecules produced as the body processes food. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36383179/"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt; found that orange juice influences pathways related to energy use, communication between cells and inflammation. It may also affect the gut microbiome, which is increasingly understood to play a role in heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37469434/"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; showed that drinking blood orange juice for a month increased the number of gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These compounds help maintain healthy blood pressure and reduce inflammation. Volunteers also showed improved blood sugar control and lower levels of inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a cluster of risk factors that includes high blood pressure, raised blood sugar and excess body fat, may see particular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study, daily orange juice consumption improved the function of the lining of blood vessels, known as endothelial function, in &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/orange-juice-combined-to-a-healthyeating-pattern-improved-endothelial-function-and-reduced-global-risk-of-chd-in-metabolic-syndrome-patients/D712014D8B24A2CC37CB9A99059F41D2"&gt;68 obese participants&lt;/a&gt;. Endothelial function describes how well blood vessels relax and widen, and better function is associated with a lower risk of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all studies report the same outcomes. A &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/orange-juice-combined-to-a-healthyeating-pattern-improved-endothelial-function-and-reduced-global-risk-of-chd-in-metabolic-syndrome-patients/D712014D8B24A2CC37CB9A99059F41D2"&gt;broader analysis&lt;/a&gt; of blood fat concentrations found that although levels of &lt;a href="https://labtestsonline.org.uk/tests/ldl-cholesterol-test"&gt;low density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt; (LDL), often called the bad cholesterol, often fall, other lipid measurements, such as triglycerides and HDL, may not change much. Even so, people who regularly drink orange juice may still benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-511X-12-119"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; of 129 workers in an orange juice factory in Brazil reported lower blood concentrations of &lt;a href="https://labtestsonline.org.uk/tests/apo-b"&gt;apolipoprotein B&lt;/a&gt;, or apo-B, a marker that reflects the number of cholesterol-carrying particles linked to heart attack risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the evidence challenges the idea that drinking citrus fruit juice is simply consuming sugar in a glass. Whole fruit remains the better choice because of its fibre, but a modest daily glass of pure orange juice appears to have effects that build up over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include easing inflammation, supporting healthier blood flow and improving several blood markers linked to long-term heart health. It is a reminder that everyday foods can have more influence on the body than we might expect.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270492/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Chemically, however, it’s anything but simple. Right where air meets liquid, water molecules and dissolved ions arrange themselves in ways that control how gases react, how droplets age in the atmosphere, and how electric charges move in devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, chemists used a fairly tidy story to describe this boundary. Some ions were said to crowd toward the top of the liquid, while others were said to stay buried below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting separation of charge created a smooth electric field that lined up nearby water molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent work from the &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/154064/polymer-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt; for Polymer Research in Germany takes a much closer look at that story and finds that the real surface of salty water is more structured and less tidy than that textbook picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-water-molecules-and-surfaces"&gt;Water molecules and surfaces&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the standard explanation, large, easily distorted ions, such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/iodide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;iodide&lt;/a&gt;, were treated as surface lovers. They were expected to collect in the top layer of water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller, less flexible ions such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fluoride&lt;/a&gt; were thought to avoid that boundary and stay deeper in the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If positive and negative ions separated even slightly near the surface, they would form an electric double layer – a thin charged region that nudged the &lt;a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/exploringourfluidearth/chemical/properties-water/hydrogen-bonds-make-water-sticky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;O-H bonds&lt;/a&gt; in water molecules to point more in one direction than in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scheme was applied to many common dissolved substances: sodium halides, hydroxide, sulfate, perchlorate, and similar ions found in seawater and in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-cycles-through-plants-with-unexpected-speed/"&gt;atmospheric droplets&lt;/a&gt;. The details varied from ion to ion, but the overall picture rested on that same double-layer idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laser-view-of-water-air-boundary"&gt;Laser view of water-air boundary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test how accurate that view was, researchers turned to a surface-specific laser technique called heterodyne-detected vibrational sum-frequency generation, often shortened to HD-VSFG. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two laser beams of different colors hit the water-air boundary at the same time. Only molecules that sit at this boundary can generate a new beam whose color equals the sum of the two incoming colors, so the measured signal comes almost entirely from that surface region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That signal carries information about how O-H bonds vibrate and, through its sign, about whether those bonds tend to point toward the air or toward the deeper liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They first examined pure water. The spectrum at the boundary showed a sharp feature from O-H groups that were not hydrogen bonded and that stuck out from surface molecules, along with a broad band from hydrogen-bonded O-H groups underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp feature indicated so-called free O-H groups pointing outward, while many of the hydrogen-bonded groups leaned back toward the bulk liquid below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-ions-enter"&gt;When ions enter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissolving strong acids such as hydrochloric acid or salts with strongly surface-active anions such as perchlorate changed this pattern in a clear way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sharp free O-H peak weakened markedly, showing that these ions moved directly into the outermost layer and capped those exposed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-captured-on-video-forming-out-of-thin-air-for-the-first-time/"&gt;O-H groups&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under those conditions, ions occupied the very top of the liquid, and the behavior lined up with the traditional electric double layer picture, with charges gathered at the interface and water molecules responding to their combined field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More familiar salts behaved differently. Solutions containing sodium chloride, sodium fluoride, sodium bromide, sodium iodide, sodium hydroxide, cesium fluoride, and several sulfate salts left the sharp free O-H feature largely intact, even at high concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These measurements showed that even at high concentrations, the outermost &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pfas-forever-chemicals-in-tap-water-linked-to-33-percent-increase-in-cancer-rates/"&gt;layer of water&lt;/a&gt; stayed mostly free of ions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the broad band from hydrogen-bonded O-H groups changed strongly, with its shape and strength depending on which ions were present and how concentrated the solution was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ions therefore reorganized water near the boundary from just below the surface, rather than filling that top layer themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work demonstrates that the surface of simple electrolyte solutions has a different ion distribution than previously thought and that the ion-enriched subsurface determines how the interface is organized: at the very top there are a few layers of pure water, then an ion-rich layer, then finally the bulk salt solution,” explained co-first author Dr Yair Litman, from the Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-water-molecule-layers"&gt;Water molecule layers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within this layered region, water molecules responded mainly to nearby ions rather than to one smooth electric field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a positively charged ion such as sodium, water molecules oriented so that their oxygen atoms faced the ion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a negatively charged ion such as hydroxide or a halide, water molecules flipped the other way, with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-catalyst-precatalyst-improves-clean-hydrogen-production-to-99-9-efficiency/"&gt;hydrogen atoms&lt;/a&gt; pointing toward the ion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With many ions in the subsurface zone, this produced patches in which water molecules preferred one orientation and other patches where they preferred the opposite orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mixture of water molecules pointing in different directions produced a complicated pattern in the HD-VSFG signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of the signal looked as if water were polarized one way, while other parts looked as if the water were polarized the other way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple model with one broad &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sunlights-hidden-power-supercharges-water-evaporation/"&gt;electric field&lt;/a&gt; pushing water mostly in a single direction could not explain that dual behavior, but the stratified arrangement with ion-poor and ion-rich layers could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-thin-layer-matters"&gt;Why this thin layer matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salty water surfaces play a key role in atmospheric chemistry. Tiny sea-salt droplets host reactions that influence climate and air quality, and many of those reactions occur at or near the boundary between air and liquid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because ions concentrate in a subsurface zone instead of right at the top of the droplet, the way gases enter droplets, how acids and bases behave there, and how pollutants transform can all differ from what older models predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar ideas may apply to electrolytes near electrodes in batteries and to solutions near biological membranes in living cells, where charge distributions at boundaries affect how energy and signals move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results show a reversal of current textbook models, suggesting that, instead of imagining heavy ions clustering directly at the surface, we should picture a thin, layered interface that gently reshapes the hydrogen-bonding patterns of water just below the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01416-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:58:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQTEh2ZWhCcEJOOFdURVozV1lNUjNOclNoeTljQThiNUJ0OUk5dzliaGZiWGtxRURlc0VONGw3SFJTano2MG8xcVllbjcxZzFyQjdCQWp1ZTU3YS1nZXJqLThnaTFSdUNwYjhLTUtILXBwN0s4VWNsUWs4eG93WWw1RUdOckdLS2JBWlhab1pZdzdWVTN0UjQ2eDA4Vm9rdF96ZU9YMWlCd0U</guid></item><item><title>麻疹病例激增是“火灾警报” ，警告其他疾病可能是下一个- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/surging-measles-cases-fire-alarm-103000240.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A nurse administers a dose of the measles vaccine to a man during a vaccination campaign in response to a measles outbreak, in Mexico City on Nov. 12. (Raquel Cunha / Reuters)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surging number of measles cases around the world is a stark warning sign that outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases could be next, the World Health Organization warned Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s crucial to understand why measles matters,” said Dr. Kate O’Brien, director of the WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. “Its high transmissibility means that even small drops in vaccine coverage can trigger outbreaks, like a fire alarm going off when smoke is detected first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, measles is often the first disease to pop up when vaccination rates overall drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we see measles cases, it signals that gaps are almost certainly likely for other vaccine-preventable diseases like diphtheria or whooping cough or polio, even though they may not be setting off the fire alarm just yet," O'Brien said at a media briefing Monday, ahead of the release of the WHO's Progress Toward Measles Elimination report, published Friday in its &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/journals/weekly-epidemiological-record" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Weekly Epidemiological Record;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Weekly Epidemiological Record&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, whooping cough cases are also rising in the United States and are on track to be the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most in a decade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;most in a decade&lt;/a&gt;. More than 20,000 whooping cough cases have been reported so far in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, there were an estimated 11 million measles infections worldwide, according to the report, nearly 800,000 more than were recorded in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, 59 countries reported large measles outbreaks. In 2025, the United States joined the list of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elimination status threatened&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing outbreaks threaten the so-called measles elimination statuses of some countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elimination means a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. (Only one virus — smallpox — has been eradicated, or wiped out permanently, worldwide.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 81 countries had reached elimination status in 2024, according to the WHO. Canada eliminated measles in 1998. Two years later, the United States did the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elimination status means a country has the capacity to stop an outbreak when measles cases arrive from abroad, O'Brien said. If vaccination rates are high enough, the virus won't have enough unvaccinated people to infect, halting an outbreak in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccination rates in the United States are falling: An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBC News investigation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NBC News investigation&lt;/a&gt; revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key determining factor for a country to lose its measles elimination status is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/canada-loses-measles-elimination-status-will-us-rcna242630" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Canada met that threshold;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Canada met that threshold&lt;/a&gt; this month. The United States could be next if scientists can trace current cases to a Texas outbreak that began in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the samples analyzed from those early cases were identified as a genotype of measles called D8, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; published in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The D8 genotype was recently detected in a South Carolina outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results from specimens sent from South Carolina to CDC labs "are the same type, D8, that is seen in other settings in the United States," Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health, said at a news briefing Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional genetic sequencing is needed to make a definitive link between the Texas outbreak and the one in South Carolina, as well as outbreaks in Utah and Arizona. A South Carolina Department of Public Health spokesman said the agency "expects those results in the next few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell said that as of Tuesday, 58 cases had been reported in South Carolina, mostly in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna240592" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;outbreak along the border of Arizona and Utah&lt;/a&gt; continues to grow. The &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Arizona Department of Health Services;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Arizona Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; reported 153 cases this week, nearly all in Mohave County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases in Utah have reached 102, according to the &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:state Department of Health and Human Services;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;state Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. While the bulk of those cases are linked to the cluster at the Utah-Arizona border, case numbers are also rising near Salt Lake City. &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51410730/measles-confirmed-in-8-students-at-wasatch-high-utahs-total-eclipses-100-infections" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBC affiliate KSL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NBC affiliate KSL&lt;/a&gt; reported that eight students at a high school in Wasatch County had been diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Wednesday, the CDC had reported 1,798 confirmed measles cases in 42 states in 2025.

But a few stubborn kilos just wouldn't budge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She had tried everything, she says. Going on a stricter diet; being more consistent with her high-intensity workouts six days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But "nothing worked" for the Brazilian lawyer who weighed 76kg (11st 13lb) and is 1.69m tall (5ft 6in).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Then, friends let her in on a secret - they'd been using weight-loss injections and were thrilled with the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So despite being a long-standing fitness fanatic, Gabriela, 40, decided to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She bought her first Ozempic jabs in February 2024 from a pharmacy in Rio de Janeiro – with no prescription - and began taking them without medical oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The results were almost immediate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It was surreal," recalls Gabriela, which is not her real name. "I'd go to a Japanese buffet, eat six pieces of sushi and feel like I'd had a whole rack of ribs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The transformation was noticeable, but it didn't last. When she stopped taking the injections, slowly but surely, the weight crept back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That's when Gabriela's new routine began. She would stop taking the jabs when she was satisfied with the way she looked. But when the reflection in the mirror wasn't quite what she wanted, the process would begin again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She's been going through this cycle for a year now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When I look in the mirror and like what I see, everything in life feels easier," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors warn that people like Gabriela, who have no medical need for weight-loss jabs and are taking them intermittently and without clinical supervision, are gambling with their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the UK, the National Health Service generally won't prescribe weight-loss jabs - which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger and make you feel full for longer - unless your body mass index (BMI) is above 35 or 40, depending on the drug. The threshold is lower for some ethnic groups and people with certain weight-related health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Gabriela's BMI was 26.6 when she started taking the jabs.

some without medical need - we may begin to see rare side effects more regularly," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Common side effects of the drugs include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But rarer and more serious ones include acute gallstone disease, pancreatitis and serious allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Gabriela says her only issue so far has been mild stomach pain, which she blames on a combination of not eating and drinking alcohol while using the jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I was going through a wild phase," she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Another drawback of the jabs is that they can cause people to lose muscle as well as fat, and this is likely to be particularly true for those who are slimmer, says Halpern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Slim individuals on restrictive diets tend to lose muscle more than fat," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If they regain weight later, their body composition worsens," he adds, noting that this "yo-yo cycle" of losing and regaining "raises the long-term risk of weight gain," especially when cycling on and off the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The patient leaflets for Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro recommend once‑weekly injections on a fixed schedule under medical supervision, indicating the drugs are intended for regular, continuous use rather than occasional or sporadic dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They are meant to be injected into the upper arm, thigh, or stomach, with doses gradually increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Emotional toll&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are also psychological dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Halpern says he sees patients who imagine that if they lose weight they'll feel loved, happy and accepted, but these expectations are rarely realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When people stop taking jabs and the weight returns, they often feel like failures, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Another challenge is that our bodies tend to resist long-term weight loss, explains Dr Cork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"When you lose weight, your body doesn't just say, 'Great, job done.' Hunger hormones ramp up, your metabolism slows, and your body tries to restore what it sees as your natural point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He points out that as soon as patients stop taking the jabs, which suppress hunger signals, the body resumes its fight to regain the weight it has lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is why they are intended for long-term use in patients who need them, he says, stressing that obesity is a chronic disease. In the UK, NHS guidelines currently limit the use of weight-loss drugs to a maximum of two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;No plans to stop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In early 2025, Britain's General Pharmaceutical Council tightened restrictions on how online pharmacies can sell and prescribe the jabs in response to growing concerns about misuse, safety and supply shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Brazil also tightened the rules this year around the prescribing of the drugs for similar reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Despite the risks, Gabriela and Andrew say they have no plans to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I think I've become addicted to it," admits Gabriela, while Andrew sees the drug as a long-term commitment to his appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He sees it as a "relatively informed risk" he's taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If I happen to cycle on and off this for the rest of my life, that would probably be OK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:04:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9TYmhCWWMwSHZLcjlqVkstNk52RWpsZEpXQkQ5MV9tTFdQcmRCUERhNjdaQXBMQWtSY3MxOWtNejlZWDhXZnp2TnkyS2dHQV9EYVFYM3dLc2lld9IBX0FVX3lxTE1BRjZSOTd4WXkwbHR1a2Z0YjIwbnlXb0k3LWRINUw1Z1lKY3FZelpwQTJXbC1PS2dWcjE1MWZTemxsLVBzd04yNXpvNlBOaHRPRmV4WWpKc3dZRWs5ZVYw</guid></item><item><title>这项90秒的测试有望使数百万人免受结肠镜检查的影响-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/the-90-second-test-promising-to-spare-millions-from-colonoscopy-b6sdwh7kp</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 90-second test for bowel cancer could spare more than half a million people a year from invasive colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Experts believe the test, which can rapidly rule out the disease in 80 per cent of patients with worrying symptoms, could make a significant dent in NHS waiting lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The Oricol test, made by the Cambridge-based company Origin Sciences, uses a “triomic” approach that assesses three factors: genetic mutations, the epigenetic chemical tags that switch genes on and off, and the bacteria associated with early cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study of 800 patients tested in Shropshire, to be published in the Nature Communications science journal this week, confirmed that this approach accurately separates healthy patients from those with cancer. It also picks up polyps, a sign that&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; cancer could be on the way. Scientists describe the test as a “biological tape recorder”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Given by a nurse at a community diagnostics centre, it cannot definitively diagnose bowel cancer. Instead those who receive a positive result must have a colonoscopy in hospital. But the study results confirm it is an accurate way of giving the majority of patients the all-clear, meaning they never require the more invasive test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If a larger study, due to be published next year, confirms the test is an accurate way of ruling out bowel cancer it could be quickly introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;NHS officials are watching the technology with interest. Almost 44,000 people a year in Britain are &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/bowel-cancer-symptoms-diet-age-888hh9kz2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;diagnosed with bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;, also known as colorectal cancer, and it kills 17,500 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About 750,000 people in Britain each year are referred for a colonoscopy after displaying the warning signs, which include blood in the stool. A colonoscopy, in which a long flexible tube with a camera is used to examine the inside of the large intestine, is the gold standard for diagnosing bowel cancer. But it is invasive and expensive, costing the NHS between £800 and £1,200 per patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jon Lacy-Colson, a colorectal surgeon at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, which has been using the Oricol test, said: “A colonoscopy requires bowel prep, it requires taking two days off work and then 45 minutes having this invasive test. For every 100 patients who have a colonoscopy after reporting symptoms, four of them have got cancer. Sixteen of them have got a significant polyp. The remaining 80 don’t have anything serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He said the Oricol test meant those 80 per cent of patients without problems could be given the all-clear without enduring a colonoscopy. Nationally, that would mean reducing the number of colonoscopies conducted on the NHS by at least 600,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And it is far quicker. “Under the old system it took us 14 days just to see people for a colonoscopy,” Lacy-Colson said. “We’re seeing people for this test at day three.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oricol, which is expected to cost the NHS less than £300 per test, involves inserting a small syringe into the rectum. A balloon is briefly inserted, deflated then removed. It is then analysed in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Parminder Dhani, 65, from Telford, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in June after taking part in the Oricol trial. She was referred by her GP after experiencing stomach pain. Getting the new test was “very quick, very easy and quite comfortable”, she said. A colonoscopy confirmed she had bowel cancer and she was referred for surgery. The speed of the process was remarkable, she said. “It all happened really quickly — from the process to actually having it removed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.13"&gt;&lt;div id="1ff32aba-7ec1-42b6-abc8-91cec1cf012a"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__SecondaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-5 guQatV"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;COURTESY OF PARMINDER DHANI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lord Prior of Brampton, a former health minister and former chairman of NHS England, is convinced the test could have a significant impact. “It could be a big thing for the NHS,” said Prior, who chairs the Origin Science advisory committee. “It could make a massive difference both to patient outcomes and to the cost of diagnostics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bowel cancer is frequently picked up too late. Deborah James, the cancer blogger who became famous as “BowelBabe”, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/obituaries/article/dame-deborah-james-obituary-bq2rtbs8k" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;died in 2022&lt;/a&gt; aged 40, five and a half years after being diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer. She went to the GP several times with symptoms but waited so long for a colonoscopy that she paid to have one privately. Bowel cancer referrals in England have &lt;a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/dashboards/ers-open-data" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;risen from 360,000 to a peak of 419,000 a week&lt;/a&gt; since James died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Jo Williams, group chief executive of Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, where 2,000 patients have had the test, said: “This new test could revolutionise the entire colon cancer diagnostic pathway and have a huge impact on our patients. It will make it a more comfortable experience for patients, particularly for those who find tests and a healthcare setting a stressful experience. If successful, the test could lead to a reduction in the number of patients requiring a colonoscopy and cancer could be diagnosed at an earlier stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Hugo Lywood, chief executive of Origin Sciences, said in future the company’s device could be used to test for several cancers at once. It could also be used to vastly improve the bowel cancer screening programme, in which everyone aged 50 to 74 is offered an at home test every two years assessing blood in the stool. “The screening programme only picks up 10 per cent of all cases of colorectal cancer in the UK,” said Lywood. The remainder are picked up when symptoms arise, typically once the disease has advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lywood attributed this to the low sensitivity of the faecal screening test sent through the post, which is set low so &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;the NHS&lt;/a&gt; is not overwhelmed by demand for colonoscopies. If Oricol were used as an interim test, to confirm the faecal test findings but before colonoscopy, the sensitivity of the initial test could be raised. “We think we could shift that 10 per cent of cases found through screening to 60 per cent,” Lywood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;And because his test is good at picking up polyps or advanced adenomas, an early sign that cancer could be on the way, it could trigger early treatment. Lywood said: “In that case it becomes a cancer prevention tool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 30 Nov 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPOUJKa3QtcWxYeTFvdkUzbzllR1hLRS0xcXhxc0sydHFlREJzRFoyUjRiazBJRF9fX0N4MXllSzUteUFYWmw4Sjh4VEc3ekxWRVVoOEVUdmVsUzRIeVViQktkZV9CSVhLMUx0UWJaWnRlWVZFUU5kNkw1TUlFM3FwS2xMYjdNcUoyLVBmME1la1N1NEgwdXpGOWpIOC1rZXNfWG9FVFlVaHp0MEk4SEMzdkxvejh4Q0FNNzR2eA</guid></item><item><title>睡眠专家揭示梦中牙齿脱落背后的令人不安的含义-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/sleep-expert-reveals-disturbing-meanings-behind-teeth-falling-out-in-your-dreams/articleshow/125662600.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever jolted awake convinced your teeth were crumbling out of your mouth, you’re in good company. A recent survey of 2,000 people in the UK, commissioned by Netflix in connection with its animated film In Your Dreams, suggests that teeth-falling-out dreams sit alongside falling, being chased and unexpectedly turning up naked in public as some of the nation’s most frequently reported nocturnal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than dismissing them as random, one dream expert says they can act like a quiet guide to what’s really on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Simple Bedtime Practices From Sadhguru For Better Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“Dreams are like a friend” &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delphi Ellis, a qualified counsellor, mindfulness practitioner and author of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Answers In The Dark: Grief, Sleep and How Dreams Can Help You Heal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, was asked to interpret the patterns that emerged from the Netflix survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dreams are like a friend, they can softly nudge us in the direction of what we want, point us towards what might help us heal, or offer insight, even answers, into a problem that's occupying our mind. It's one reason we say, 'sleep on it'.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may or may not act on them, but Ellis says it’s at least worth paying attention. “Like a friend, we can choose to acknowledge or ignore them, it's up to us what we do with the content of our dreams, but it's always worth listening to what a dream has to say.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One dream in particular clearly struck a nerve in the survey: teeth falling out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What it could mean when your teeth fall out in a dream &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the familiar catalogue of unsettling dreams, one stands out as uniquely distressing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While being chased or falling can feel metaphorically frightening, dreaming about your teeth feels bodily, primal, almost horror-coded. Around 21 percent of respondents said they’ve dreamt of their teeth falling out, sometimes crumbling like chalk, sometimes dropping into their hands, sometimes suddenly vanishing from their mouth. It’s one of the most upsetting dream types precisely because it feels so physical and intimately connected to identity, appearance and even survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellis suggests it may be linked to how secure you feel about status, money or what you’re “worth” in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the West we generally exchange our teeth for money when we are little,” she explained. That early swap, tooth for coin, can leave a symbolic trace: teeth become quietly linked in our minds with value, reward and what we “deserve”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that light, a dream where they fall out might reflect anxiety about security or standing in life rather than dentistry itself. A promotion that didn’t happen, financial pressure, feeling like you’re losing your grip on a role or image you’ve worked hard for – any of those could show up in this sort of dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For others, Ellis says, the symbolism leans more towards loss than money. “In some cultures, dreaming of teeth as they literally are (as bone) may symbolize anxiety about losing someone significant.” That could be a fear about a relationship changing, a loved one becoming more distant, or a general dread of grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if your teeth are falling out in a dream, your brain may be playing out deeper worries about what you might be about to lose – whether that’s status, stability or someone close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Falling, running, flying: other common dream themes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Netflix-commissioned survey asked 2,000 UK adults about their most frequent dreams. Ellis emphasises that these aren’t definitive meanings, just recurring emotional patterns, but the data reveals how common these themes really are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling – 53% Unable to run – 42% Partner cheating – 22% Someone dying – 21% Teeth falling out – 21% Snogging a celebrity – 20% Exam you haven't revised for – 19% Flying – 18% Friends/family being mean – 16% Being late – 15% Finding money – 14% Unable to find the toilet – 12% Naked in public – 12% &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Falling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common dream of all in the survey was falling – reported by more than half of those asked. Ellis links this to uncertainty and change:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It happens if we're not sure where we're going or where we'll end up,” she said. “It's especially common after redundancy, retirement and other major life changes. The adventure awaits, but can be scary as we venture into the unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also draws a line between that lingering dream of falling and the sharp “jolt” some people feel just as they’re dropping off to sleep. That physical startle, she notes, “can (ironically) be caused by over tiredness or point to signs of stress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Being chased but unable to run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 42 percent of people said they’ve dreamt of trying to run, but feeling as if their legs won’t move. Ellis says this can mirror feeling behind or hemmed in in waking life: “The feeling of not being able to run can symbolise being ‘stuck’ in a situation, that progress is too slow, or the fear that whatever it is will ‘catch up’ with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Partners cheating and people dying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just over a fifth of respondents said they had dreamt of a partner cheating. Ellis is clear that this usually speaks more to fear than to fact. “Dreaming about infidelity often signals a fear that it could occur, rather than serving as a warning that it already has, particularly for those who have experienced betrayal in the past,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;People dying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dreams of people dying, reported by a similar proportion, are often about change rather than literal death. Ellis notes that for many parents, dreaming about a child dying is really about watching a particular phase of childhood “end” as they become more independent, and the relationship shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Flying&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 18 percent of people reported dreams of flying. Ellis says how it feels in the dream is crucial. “If the dream is positive and they’re loving it – ‘flying high’ may signify someone enjoying a period of success.” If the mood is anxious or out of control, it might be a sign you feel you should “keep your feet on the ground” for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Mean friends and families&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreams where family or friends are unkind can reflect a quiet worry about belonging. Sixteen percent of people surveyed say they’ve experienced this, and Ellis suggests it may be tied to a fear of exclusion or strained social ties. “If people are being mean, the dream may be a prompt to reconsider who we include in our circle,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Being late&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreams about being late, reported by 15 percent of respondents, tend to mirror real-life anxieties around time, performance or pressure. Ellis explains: “In today’s world, it’s natural to fear being late, so this may be a literal dream reflecting what we worry could happen.” But it can also signal the feeling of missing out, socially, professionally or personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Finding money &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding money in a dream, something 14 percent of people reported, may simply echo financial stress. Ellis notes: “If a person has money worries, it makes sense for them to have this dream; wealth is subjective though, so the money may also be a symbol for something else the dreamer feels might improve their life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Celebrity romance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="104"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dreaming of a romantic encounter with a celebrity, about one in five of us have, often reflects admiration or identification. “If we can relate to a particular celebrity’s struggle, or if we see someone… as a role model, or if we admire them – we may dream about them as if they are closer to us than they really are,” Ellis said. It’s less about desire and more about projection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unprepared exam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dreaded no-revision exam dream, still experienced by 19 percent of adults, may reflect feeling unprepared for something in waking life, a conversation, a decision, a responsibility. But Ellis adds it may reach back into feelings from adolescence: “Exams usually happen at school… harking back to past anxieties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unable to find the toilet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="116"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being unable to find the toilet appears in 12 percent of people’s dreams. Sometimes it really is just your physical body saying Wake up, you need the bathroom. But Ellis notes: “This dream can signify you are in a time of your life where you lack privacy and searching for more private time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="121"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Naked in public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="124"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, being naked in public, also reported by around 12 percent, can indicate vulnerability. Ellis said: “It may reflect the awareness of being ‘on show’ or in the spotlight for some reason… or that we’ve talked about something that left us feeling vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="127"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="128"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make sense of your dreams &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="129"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Netflix survey and Ellis’s interpretations offer a useful starting point, but dream meaning is not one-size-fits-all. Two people can have the same dream and take away something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="131"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical and cognitive hypnotherapist Sarah Bick, who works with the subconscious mind at Inna Therapies, suggests treating your dreams as personal messages rather than universal codes. She recommends writing your dream down in detail as soon as you wake, then noting what each element brings to mind &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;for you,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; without looking up generic meanings first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="136"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A symbol like “teeth” might, for one person, immediately call up childhood memories of the tooth fairy and money; for another, it could evoke a painful dental experience, or a parent who worked in healthcare. The same image will sit on top of very different histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="138"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bick advises connecting the dream back to what’s happening in your life now: current stresses, transitions, or unresolved feelings. From there, you can start to piece together a message that gives you that small “aha” moment, not a prediction of the future, but a reflection of where your mind is already working hard behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="141"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="142"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you be worried? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="143"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, you don’t need to panic about a disturbing dream, even if it’s vivid. Having your teeth fall out at night doesn’t mean they’re about to fall out during the day; dreaming of a partner cheating rarely means they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="145"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Ellis and Bick both frame dreams as another channel of information about how you’re coping. A string of anxiety dreams might be your cue to look at stress, sleep routines or unspoken worries.

When 9:30 p.m. hit, everything shut down with the force of a government mandate. The lights out, TV off, Nintendo put away, prayers said, and eyes glued shut, whether sleep was coming or not. As a lifelong night owl, it felt like torture lying there in the dark, tossing around like a rotisserie chicken, hoping sleep would magically happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, as a chronically exhausted adult who wishes I'd developed even one healthy sleep habit, I cannot help but laugh and relate when I see someone who takes bedtime more seriously than I ever did. And by someone, I mean a golden retriever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐶&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get "pawsitivity" delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bedtime Announcement That Took Over TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the viral video, this Golden Retriever has decided that the household is done for the night, whether the guests agree or not. The overlay text reads, "My Dog coming to remind our guests that it is 9pm and lights better be out because he has a strict bedtime routine." With the seriousness of a hotel manager enforcing quiet hours, he trots out carrying two essential items: his favorite blanket and a plush Patrick Star from &lt;em&gt;SpongeBob SquarePants&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As he marches up to the lingering guests, the audio choice is comedic perfection: the iconic scene from &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; where Dwight sings, "Learn your rules, you better learn your rules, if you don't, you'll be eaten in your sleep." The combination of his earnest little face, his bedtime gear, and Dwight Schrute threatening sleep-time consequences in the background? Pure PetTok gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And TikTok agrees. One person wrote, "Omg how sweet! Goldens are so funny," while another joked, "Mr. grumpy is not grumpy 😍." Someone else added, "He runs a strict program," and honestly, the evidence supports the fact that this dog is the CEO of Lights Out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/dog-emergency-text-mom-dad-154000376.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Dog's Emergency Text to Mom About Dad Has TikTok Losing It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Dog's Emergency Text to Mom About Dad Has TikTok Losing It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why TikTok Can't Get Enough of This Sleep Sergeant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of the charm is how deeply committed he is to the role. He doesn't bark, whine or pace. Instead, he politely presents his blanket, stares directly at the humans, and waits.

Half followed the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/news/health/mediterranean-diet-gum-disease-weight-loss-b2826640.html"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; for 16 weeks, while the other consumed a &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/food-and-drink/what-is-a-vegan-diet-food-person-lifestyle-health-benefits-beginners-guide-what-not-to-eat-a8122181.html"&gt;low-fat vegan diet&lt;/a&gt;, including grains, beans, and fresh produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 16 weeks, participants resumed their regular diets for four weeks before spending another 16 weeks following the opposite regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kpgaTc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/26/3/13/GettyImages-2220708372.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/26/3/13/GettyImages-2220708372.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/26/3/13/GettyImages-2220708372.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The Mediterranean diet has long been recommended by experts for overall health and weight loss" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-21514"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The Mediterranean diet has long been recommended by experts for overall health and weight loss&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Adam Berry/Getty Images for iHeartMedia)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that the low-fat vegan diet was more effective for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were measured using the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/health-and-families/plant-based-diet-vegan-tips-b2849086.html"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; diet index (PDI) to examine how eating plant-based foods was associated with weight loss. PDI measured overall intake of plant-based foods, while hPDI represented consumption of healthful plant foods, and uPDI gauged consumption of unhealthful plant foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthful foods included fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, oils, coffee, and tea. Unhealthful items included potatoes, sweets, fruit juice, sugar-sweetened beverages, and refined grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that participants’ PDI scores rose on the vegan diet but remained essentially unchanged on the Mediterranean diet, with higher scores indicating greater intake of plant-based foods. hPDI scores rose on both diets, while uPDI scores decreased on the Mediterranean diet but increased on the vegan diet, despite participants having lost more weight following the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/03/14/21/iStock-2150471415.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/03/14/21/iStock-2150471415.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/03/14/21/iStock-2150471415.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A new study showed that a low-fat vegan diet was more effective for weight loss than the Mediterranean diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-21515"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A new study showed that a low-fat vegan diet was more effective for weight loss than the Mediterranean diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in PDI scores likely came from avoiding animal products, researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Replacing animal products even with the ‘unhealthful’ plant-based foods on a vegan diet was associated with weight loss,” researchers &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1666807/full?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=23272552553&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAC_sJ7nsfb2KhFbNhSoM-ZLeeaYgV&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAraXJBhBJEiwAjz7MZQDgsj9ofxVj3NdfR6DZSVAHVuXaGC_NGq5ib4K77WXjyuDl9nkqWhoCAFUQAvD_BwE"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that replacing animal products with plant-based foods, and reducing the consumption of oil and nuts, may be successful strategies for weight loss.

Prasad noted that these deaths appeared tied to myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is a profound revelation,” Prasad wrote in the memo to staff members. “For the first time, the US FDA will acknowledge that Covid-19 vaccines have killed American children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He also wrote that new rules would impose tight restrictions on vaccines for pregnant women, marking another significant change in the agency’s approval framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I remain open to vigorous discussions and debate,” Prasad wrote, reportedly adding that staff who did not agree with the core principles of his new approach should submit their resignations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A PBS NewsHour correspondent first reported on the memo’s contents in &lt;a href="https://x.com/AliRogin/status/1994567973030535301?s=20" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; on X. The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/health/fda-children-deaths-covid-vaccines.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; noted that the document did not include identifying details such as the children’s ages, any existing health conditions, or how the causal relationship between vaccination and death was determined. The vaccine manufacturers involved were also not named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Paul Offit of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who reviewed the memo, told MedPage Today that it was a “dangerous and irresponsible thing to do”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“[Prasad] says he has evidence that this vaccine killed 10 children, but that’s not the way it works,” Offit said. “If you think you have an extraordinary claim, you should back it up with extraordinary evidence. He should have submitted it to an excellent journal where it can be reviewed by subject matter experts who can say, ‘Yes, this is clear evidence,’ then it can be published. That’s the way it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prasad’s predecessor, Dr Peter Marks, who led the FDA division throughout the pandemic, told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/health/fda-children-deaths-covid-vaccines.html?smid=bsky-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New York Times &lt;/a&gt;that he was taken aback by the “clearly political tone of the communication” and noted that the case reports of child deaths needed to be further investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I would not be surprised if the attributions turn out to be debatable, as these cases are often quite complex,” Marks told the Times after reading the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Current and former FDA staff, as well as outside public health specialists, said the new plan could dramatically slow the vaccine pipeline, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;amp;utm_source=bluesky&amp;amp;utm_medium=social" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. Requiring far larger studies before granting approvals, they said, could delay product launches and make companies more cautious about developing or expanding vaccines and may discourage innovation in vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Additionally, Prasad’s insistence on re-evaluating whether multiple vaccines should be given together could upend years of established federal guidance. The immunization schedule of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends giving multiple childhood vaccines at the same medical visit. It also encourages adults to receive several shots for respiratory viruses, including the flu, Covid and RSV, during a single appointment for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Kathryn Edwards, a vaccine expert and professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, told MedPage Today that the “determination of the cause of death in cases that are temporally related to vaccine administration is a very difficult task”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Saying definitively that a vaccine caused a death requires careful assessment, best done with an autopsy examination, and ruling out other causes of death,” she said. “That Covid vaccine might have caused a death related to myocarditis may indeed be the case. But [we] would need to see the details.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Edwards added that such details would “best be presented in a peer-reviewed manuscript where experts could review the details”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also need to remember that Covid disease caused deaths [in kids], many more than 10,” she said. “I spent the entire pandemic reviewing cases of adverse events, I would be delighted to review these cases and assess the evidence that they have to say that they are vaccine caused.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prasad’s new framework reflects several themes long advanced by Kennedy and members of the anti-vaccine movement, who have pressed for additional proof of vaccine safety and effectiveness. In August, the FDA placed &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/fda-new-covid-19-vaccines-restrictions" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on who can get Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The agency authorized Covid vaccines for people 65 and older, who are known to be more at risk from serious illnesses from Covid infections. Younger people, though, were only considered to be eligible if they had an underlying medical condition that makes them particularly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In September, Kennedy’s vaccine panel that advises the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/19/acip-vote-no-prescription-covid-vaccine" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;voted against&lt;/a&gt; recommending that people obtain a prescription for a Covid-19 vaccine, but added that coronavirus immunizations should be based on “individual-based decision making”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last week, it was reported that Ralph Abraham, a top Louisiana health official who stopped promoting mass vaccination policies and once described Covid-19 vaccines as “dangerous”, had been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/25/ralph-abraham-deputy-cdc-director" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; as the new deputy director of the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previous FDA leaders and independent scientists have emphasized that Covid-19 vaccines underwent extensive testing, including pediatric studies, and have been proven &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/16/vaccine-recommendations-anti-vax-data" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;safe and effective&lt;/a&gt;. They argue that the benefits of vaccination far exceed the risks, which remain rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3a8bb03e-e5c7-404a-bdb5-d203d6206650" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="GuideAtomWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Contact us about this story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;html&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Secure Messaging in the Guardian app&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A discovery by researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine in the US could lead to treatments that clear the troublesome &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta"&gt;aggregations of protein&lt;/a&gt; thought to play a key role in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using mice bred to have a condition similar to the neurodegenerative disorder, the team found &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;that elevated levels of a protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOX9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sox9&lt;/a&gt; triggered specialized brain cells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;to go into clean-up overdrive, 'vacuuming' up plaques with increased efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In behavioral and memory tests, the treated mice also performed better, suggesting that the intervention can help protect the brain and reverse cognitive decline – a process that typically occurs in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease as neurons are damaged and destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-keep-alzheimers-symptoms-at-bay"&gt;There's One Critical Thing You Can Do to Keep Alzheimer's Symptoms at Bay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the benefits of Sox9 &lt;span&gt;stemmed from increased expression of a receptor called MEGF10, exclusively expressed in the membranes of brain maintenance cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-cells-we-thought-were-just-fillers-might-actually-be-the-key-to-our-body-clocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;called astrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, which are deployed to remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Astrocytes perform diverse tasks that are essential for normal brain function, including facilitating brain communications and memory storage," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/brain-stars-hold-the-power-to-preserve-cognitive-function-in-model-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Dong-Joo Choi, previously at the Baylor College of Medicine and now at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As the brain ages, astrocytes show profound functional alterations.

The Sox9 protein has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.36129"&gt;previously been found&lt;/a&gt; elevated in Alzheimer's brains, which may indicate the brain's attempt to ramp up waste removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tried an opposite experiment, too, genetically engineering mice to remove Sox9. In these animals, the astrocytes showed signs of reduced health, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;memory recall worsened&lt;/a&gt;, and more amyloid-beta clumps stacked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An important point of our experimental design is that we worked with mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that had already developed cognitive impairment, such as memory deficits, and had amyloid plaques in the brain," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/brain-stars-hold-the-power-to-preserve-cognitive-function-in-model-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Choi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe these models are more relevant to what we see in many patients with Alzheimer's disease symptoms than other models in which these types of experiments are conducted before the plaques form."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now tackling the challenge of Alzheimer's disease from numerous different angles, including treatments that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/supplement-for-high-blood-pressure-clears-signs-of-alzheimers-in-mice"&gt;target amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all of these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;treatments work&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing the complexity of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;clear out amyloid-beta clumps&lt;/a&gt; or stop them from forming, but we're still not sure if these protein aggregations are causing Alzheimer's or just a result of the disease. All of these factors need to be weighed up by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, each new study gets us closer to understanding how this disease progresses – and how, eventually, it might be stopped. Although these latest tests were carried out in mice rather than humans, there's good reason to believe scientists may have discovered a crucial new route to tackling the manifestations of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most current treatments focus on neurons or try to prevent the formation of amyloid plaques," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/brain-stars-hold-the-power-to-preserve-cognitive-function-in-model-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Benjamin Deneen. "This study suggests that enhancing astrocytes' natural ability to clean up could be just as important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02115-w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration intends to get tougher on vaccine approvals, as top officials raised concerns about the risk of COVID vaccines for children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Speaking on Fox News Saturday morning, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/martin-makary" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FDA Commissioner Marty Makary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the agency would no longer "rubber-stamp new products that don't work," claiming it made a "mockery of science."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Makary's comments came the day after FDA's top vaccine regulator, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/vinay-prasad" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Vinay Prasad&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told his team the agency would change its annual flu vaccine framework, update vaccine labels to be "honest," and make other changes to how it reviews vaccines, according to contents of an internal email reviewed by NPR and &lt;a href="https://x.com/AliRogin/status/1994567973030535301?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported on first&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;em&gt;PBS News Hour&lt;/em&gt; correspondent and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/29/fda-vaccine-approval-child-covid-deaths/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;later by&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Prasad wrote that the FDA would also no longer authorize vaccines for pregnant women without stricter requirements. And for pneumonia vaccines, manufacturers will have to prove they reduce disease rather than show they generate antibodies. He also raised questions about giving multiple vaccines at the same time, which is standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The changes could make it much more difficult and expensive for vaccines to get approved, further limiting the availability of vaccines, which are considered among the safest and most effective tools for protecting people against infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While all vaccines carry some risks, most public health experts argue the current process for vetting vaccines before marketing has long assured that the benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks. Studies required after vaccines are approved and surveillance systems, including the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/report-problem-center-biologics-evaluation-research/vaccine-adverse-events" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (VAERS), also flag potential safety issues once vaccines are in use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;FDA says an analysis links COVID shots to some deaths&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Makary said on Fox News that 10 children had died from the COVID shot during the Biden administration, but did not offer specifics about how the FDA came to that conclusion. &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Millions of children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have received the vaccine.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the COVID analysis and changes to vaccine review standards.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to the FDA email from Prasad, he told the agency's biostatistics and pharmacovigilance team to analyze 96 reported deaths from 2021 to 2024, and they determined 10 children died "after and because of" the COVID vaccine. But Prasad said the true number was likely higher.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, who &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;directs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said in a text message that Prasad has not shared the evidence that these vaccines killed 10 children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Because he doesn't provide any evidence, he is asking us to trust him on an important issue," Office said. "All this will do is scare people unnecessarily. At the very least, he should provide all the evidence he has so that experts in the field can review it and decide whether he has enough data to prove his point."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jesse Goodman, &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-l-goodman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a professor at Georgetown University&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who held Prasad's job at FDA from 2003 until 2009, said in an email that the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine approval, has been "recognized globally as a gold standard regulator." Goodman defended "immunologic endpoints like antibody levels" for the accelerated approval of pneumonia and influenza vaccines. He said science supports their use and they are confirmed with studies after approval: "These approaches have helped provide children and adults with timely access to safe and effective vaccines, saving many lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/michael-osterholm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, reviewed the email from Prasad and challenged his statement that "COVID-19 was never highly lethal for children." Osterholm also questioned the FDA's latest analysis of adverse event reports attributing the 10 deaths to COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Prasad's email is filled with factual mistakes and misrepresents both the severity of COVID in children (1597 deaths in 2020-2022) and how the US responded to the first signals of possible vaccine-associated pediatric deaths in May 2021," Osterholm wrote in an email to NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While Prasad's email notes 10 such deaths, these cases have never been presented for review by the medical and public health communities or published in the medical literature," Osterholm continued. "Given the record of this Administration to misrepresent scientific data regarding vaccines, until these cases have been reviewed by an expert third party, like the National Academy of Science[s], we can not accept the fact they are vaccine-associated deaths."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Surveillance system collects vaccines reports&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA makes public data from the VAERS surveillance system co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccine-adverse-events/vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system-vaers-database-information" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;FDA cautions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, "it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause and effect relationship has been established." In his email, Prasad wrote that "with case reports, causality is typically assessed on a subjective scale. In this scale ranging from certain to unlikely -- certain, possible/likely, and probable are broadly considered as related to the product."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Makary said on Fox News that when the COVID shot was first rolled out, it was "amazing" for people at high risk of coming down with severe disease, but things have changed. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Back in 2020, we saw a reduction in the severity of illness and lives saved, but now recommending that a 6-year-old girl get another 70 million COVID shots – one each year for the rest of her life – is not based on science. And so we're not going to just rubber stamp approvals without seeing some scientific evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The claim is the latest move by Trump administration health officials questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and how the government has regulated them. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;restricted eligibility&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the updated COVID vaccines in August after announcing the agency planned to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/20/nx-s1-5405013/fda-covid-vaccine-limits" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;require more evidence &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;about the shots' safety and effectiveness going forward.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;CDC committee will meet to review vaccine policies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA email on vaccine policy comes just before the CDC convenes a crucial &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;two-day meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of that agency's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Dec. 4-5. The committee is in the process of conducting a major review of how children are inoculated against dangerous infectious diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts are concerned the committee will upend the childhood vaccination schedule. It could move to delay the timing of some inoculations, space out vaccinations and call for the reformulation of some vaccines. Taken together, the moves could result in fewer children getting protected and the resurgence of once-vanquished diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Asked about Makary and Prasad's claims that the COVID vaccine caused deaths among 10 children, Moderna, whose COVID vaccine is approved for children as young as 6 months old, pointed to a &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/statement-on-the-safety-of-spikevax" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement it made in September&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that multiple published, peer-reviewed studies from a variety of sources show its shot is safe and that it is "not aware of any deaths in the last year or pertinent new information from prior years."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moderna says it monitors its vaccine's safety along with regulators in more than 90 countries. "With more than one billion doses distributed globally, these systems — including in national health systems across Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. — have not reported any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pfizer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some chronic cannabis users, a case of the munchies is the least of their problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, ERs have seen a surge in regular tokers showing up with sudden, stomach-churning attacks that leave them doubled over in pain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The worst part? Many sufferers experience these episodes three or four times a year, often leaving both patients and providers scratching their heads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Chronic cannabis users are increasingly facing a temporarily debilitating health concern. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Seventyfour – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is CHS?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprit is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), a gut-wrenching disorder that triggers relentless nausea, abdominal pain and severe vomiting that can strike four or five times an hour, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21665-cannabis-hyperemesis-syndrome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms usually appear within 24 hours of cannabis use and can last for days. The episodes are so brutal that ER staff have coined a term for them: “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6690288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scromiting&lt;/a&gt;” — a chilling mashup of screaming and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tough to treat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its growing prevalence, many doctors are still unfamiliar with the syndrome, which was only recently defined, making it hard to distinguish from medical issues like food poisoning or the stomach flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A person often will have multiple [emergency department] visits until it is correctly recognized, costing thousands of dollars each time,” &lt;a href="https://adai.uw.edu/staff_members/bia-carlini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Beatriz Carlini&lt;/a&gt;, a research associate professor at the University of Washington (UW) School of Medicine who studies adverse health effects of cannabis use, said in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251126095029.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome patients often present with the combination of screaming and loud vomiting, which has led to the term “scromiting.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Monkey Business – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even after a diagnosis, CHS can be difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are currently no FDA-approved therapies, and standard anti-nausea medications often don’t work, according to &lt;a href="https://em.uw.edu/people/faculty/christopher-buresh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Chris Buresh&lt;/a&gt;, an emergency medicine specialist with UW Medicine and Seattle Children’s Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sometimes forces clinicians to try second- and third-line options, including &lt;a href="https://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(20)30666-1/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Haldol&lt;/a&gt;, a medication more commonly used for psychotic episodes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some patients find limited relief by rubbing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7718060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;capsaicin cream&lt;/a&gt; on their stomachs, which creates a warming sensation that can temporarily ease discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hot baths and showers also often help curb symptoms, with many patients driven to bathe for hours each day to soothe their pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s something that can clinch the diagnosis for me, when someone says they’re better with a hot shower,” Buresh said. “Patients describe going through all the hot water in their house.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Recovery challenges&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after symptoms subside, long-term recovery can be tricky. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the syndrome strikes intermittently, some cannabis users assume a recent episode was unrelated and continue using — only to become severely ill again, according to UW. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who accept the diagnosis and try to quit, addiction often makes abstinence a major challenge, prolonging the cycle of illness. Carlini said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stopping cannabis use is currently the only way to fully cure the condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From teens to long-time users&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists don’t know the exact cause of CHS, but the leading theory is that long-term overstimulation of receptors in the endocannabinoid system may disrupt the body’s natural control of nausea and vomiting, per the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;CHS can be tough to spot, often blending in with far more common gastrointestinal illnesses. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mdv Edwards – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why it affects some cannabis users but not others remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know if it’s related to the greater general availability of cannabis or the higher THC potency of some products or something else,” Buresh said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It seems like there’s a threshold when people can become vulnerable to this condition, and that threshold is different for everyone,” he added. “Even using in small amounts can make these people start throwing up.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://emed.smhs.gwu.edu/news/painful-syndrome-sending-cannabis-users-er-are-you-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at George Washington University surveyed 1,052 people with CHS in an effort to better understand risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that starting cannabis use earlier in life was linked to a higher likelihood of future ER visits for hyperemesis symptoms. Daily use and prolonged consumption were also common, with 44% reporting regular use for more than five years before the syndrome appeared. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But CHS isn’t just an adult problem. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836403" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that emergency department visits among adolescents in the US have jumped more than 10-fold from 2016 to 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Notably, while overall rates were higher in states with legal recreational cannabis, the fastest year-over-year increases in the number of adolescent CHS cases at hospitals occurred in states where casual cannabis use is still illegal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Gaining attention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 1, the World Health Organization formally recognized cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, adding an official diagnosis code to its manual. The CDC has also incorporated the new code into US diagnostic systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say the update offers several benefits, including giving researchers a clearer picture of how often CHS occurs. Having the code appear in a patient’s medical record also helps providers spot repeat episodes during future visits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A new code for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome will supply important hard evidence on cannabis-adverse events, which physicians tell us is a growing problem,” Carlini said. &lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

So why do canned foods still get such a bad rap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitian &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="http://www.lauraburaknutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Laura Burak, MS, RDN;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Laura Burak, MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of GetNaked Nutrition, blames it on marketing stigma in the wellness industry. "Canned foods get lumped in with ultra-processed foods simply because they're not raw or fresh, even though they're just heated and sealed," she says. But, ironically, the canning process actually helps preserve so many good-for-you nutrients in veggies, more so than their fresh counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's also interesting is that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4517017/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research has shown;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that people who consume more canned food tend to have healthier eating patterns overall. For this story, we spoke to two dietitians to help clear fact from fiction and explain why canned veggies deserve a place in your diet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nutritionally, how do canned vegetables compare to fresh ones?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, let's get clear on how canned veggies are made. Before canning, vegetables are cleaned and blanched (briefly cooked in hot water or steam); then, they're packed into cans with liquid and heated to high temperatures to kill bacteria and create a shelf-stable product, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/shelf-stable-food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;United States Department of Agriculture&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (USDA). Contrary to the stigma associated with canned foods, the canning process actually helps preserve the veggies' nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Canned veggies can be more nutritious than fresh because they are canned at peak freshness, so vitamins and minerals are locked in," Burak says. &lt;strong&gt;"The canning process can actually &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.eatright.org/food/planning/smart-shopping/are-canned-foods-nutritious-for-my-family" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:better preserve many nutrients;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;better preserve many nutrients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in veggies,&lt;/strong&gt; such as the fiber content; beta-carotene (the pigment found in orange foods like carrots which then converts into vitamin A); minerals including magnesium, iron, calcium, and potassium; and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, &lt;strong&gt;exposure to heat from the canning process can also help boost certain antioxidants.&lt;/strong&gt; "The process of canning tomatoes &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/2/3/352" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increases the availability of the antioxidant lycopene;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increases the availability of the antioxidant lycopene&lt;/a&gt;, which is linked to a lower risk for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8880080/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9741066/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;," says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.sheridietitian.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of Sheri The Plant Strong Dietitian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Because canned veggies are heated, they might lose out on some heat-sensitive, water-soluble nutrients&lt;/strong&gt;, such as vitamin C and some B vitamins. &lt;strong&gt;But fresh veggies often travel far distances from the farm to your table, so &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157517300418" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:they lose nutrients while in transit;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they lose nutrients while in transit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;—not to mention, during the time spent sitting in the supermarket and then in your refrigerator.&lt;/strong&gt; Plus, &lt;strong&gt;if you normally cook your veggies instead of eating them raw, you're losing out on those heat-sensitive nutrients anyway. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time you think canned veggies are inferior to fresh, remember this: "Fresh vegetables lose nutrients in transit time due to heat, light, air, and temperature shifts, so when you open a can of veggies, you can be confident that they're just as nutritious as when they were picked," Burak says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about sodium in canned vegetables?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians always recommend looking for canned vegetables with no added salt or reduced sodium. "&lt;strong&gt;A can of green beans with no added salt may contain as low as 20 mg of sodium per serving, whereas a can with added salt may have as much as 400 mg of sodium per serving,"&lt;/strong&gt; Gaw says. But if you can't find lower-sodium options at your grocery store, you can &lt;strong&gt;rinse the veggies well under cold running water to reduce the sodium content by about 40%,&lt;/strong&gt; Gaw says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll also want to look for cans that are BPA-free, or choose veggies stored in glass jars or aseptic boxes.

Here's how dietitians recommend adding them into your weekly meal plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix pure canned pumpkin into oatmeal, pancake mixes, or baked goods.&lt;/strong&gt; This is one of Burak's favorite ways to instantly boost these foods' nutritional content. That &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a62724763/cdc-most-nutritious-foods-pumpkin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pumpkin is packed with beta-carotene, fiber, and antioxidants,;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pumpkin is packed with beta-carotene, fiber, and antioxidants,&lt;/a&gt; which is amazing for your eye and skin health, gut health, and immunity, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use canned beans, corn, and tomatoes to make a variety of nutritious soups, stews, and chilis,&lt;/strong&gt; which are full of fiber, nutrients, and flavor. Whip up a big pot to last several days. Burak says it's one of the most delicious, convenient, and budget-conscious ways to upgrade your nutrition and add more veggies to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add drained and rinsed canned black, white, pinto, or garbanzo beans to soups, salads, stews, pasta, or grain bowls.&lt;/strong&gt; Gaw loves doing this for a protein and fiber boost. "Canned beans are one of the most convenient and affordable sources of plant protein," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporate canned or jarred artichokes in pasta, rice dishes, dips, or salad,&lt;/strong&gt; Gaw recommends. The jarred and canned versions can save you a lot of prepping fuss and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use canned corn (with no added salt or is rinsed well) as a side dish or an addition to a soup, stew, or salad&lt;/strong&gt; to balance a meal with energizing carbs and fiber, Gaw says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stocking canned veggies in your pantry can be one of the easiest ways to upgrade the nutrition content of your diet.&lt;/strong&gt; They're full of nutrients because they're packed at peak freshness. And canned veggies are versatile and quick to add to many recipes, so they might help you rely on takeout a little less. Plus, they're usually more accessible, affordable, and last longer than the fresh veggies rotting in your fridge every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 19:16:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQaUx6Q1dlX01heXRvNnRRelEyNFJrdGhZVXJrQTZOXzdTRUViUUlYZXctcFFLUVNvM3FXNVoxYnJ4U2dlMHh4UVJJUG1iNks0ZWVrSWREWmN0LXI1SjJaRm9mWmprazlLS1JLQXFOUWZOTTNwaWstT2VXQXRHR0dFWnEzb2ZEeUZ1TERsU1pHbG1SVVU</guid></item><item><title>FDA官员在没有提供数据的情况下，声称COVID-19疫苗与儿科死亡之间存在联系- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/food-drug-administration-covid-19-vaccines-pediatric-deaths/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Vinay Prasad, the director of the Food and Drug Administration's vaccine division, sent a memo to staff that linked children's deaths to the COVID-19 vaccine, but did not provide data to back the claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo said that a review "found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination," according to multiple sources familiar with the email. The memo was first reported by the New York Times.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad suggested that the deaths were related to myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle. Prasad did not share any data used in the review, including the children's ages, whether they had existing health conditions, or how the FDA determined there was a link between their death and the vaccine. The findings were not published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myocarditis has been linked to the COVID-19 vaccine, but &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2110475" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;studies have largely confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the risk of the condition is significantly higher after a coronavirus infection, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccines-myocarditis-heart-damage-infection-children/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;pediatric cardiologists told CBS News in 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The prognosis following myocarditis due to the vaccine is also better than from infection, &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/full/10.1016/j.jacc.2022.09.049" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.

Now, most people receive each dose of the vaccine about a year apart. If someone receives the primary series before age 5, the risk virtually disappears. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-covid-vaccine-mrna-heart-side-effects-warning-label/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;carry warnings about the risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of myocarditis or pericarditis, a condition where the membrane surrounding the heart becomes inflamed. The warnings were expanded in April 2025 to apply to males aged 16 to 25. The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines, developed during the first Trump administration, have become a target of the second. Top FDA officials selected by the administration under Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-aluminum-ingredients/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; overrode career staff to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA. A &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; official said in June that she was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-official-overseeing-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations-resigns/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;resigning from her role&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; overseeing updates to the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, following &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines-cdc-children-pregnant-women/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;an order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from Kennedy that forced an update to the agency's guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kids-flu-covid-shots-fall-2025-vaccine-guidance-shifts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Changing COVID-19 vaccination guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has caused confusion for many. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-acip-recap-measles-mmrv-covid-vaccines/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;voted in September&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to change recommendations for the shot. All members of the committee have been picked by Kennedy, himself a vaccine skeptic. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Several of the panel members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have criticized the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated CDC guidance recommends people make individual, informed decisions about COVID-19 vaccination, but did not specifically recommend the shots. The &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-shot-recommendations-american-academy-of-pediatrics-cdc/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; said it was "strongly recommending" shots for children between 6 months and 2 years old, while the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/ID-topics/infectious-disease/covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt; recommended the vaccine for everyone six months and older. State governments have also banded together, forming the &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/IMM-1481.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2025/announce-northeast-public-health-collaborative.page" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Northeast Public Health Collaborative&lt;/a&gt;, to issue recommendations that differ from the CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

In it, Prasad claims that agency staff determined that “no fewer than 10” of 96 child deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, between 2021 and 2024 were “related” to Covid vaccination. He said the true numbers could be higher, accusing the agency of ignoring the safety concerns for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f73a77" class="body-graf"&gt;The memo, sent Friday, did not include the children’s ages or medical histories, timelines or documentation for the deaths he references and does not identify the manufacturer of the vaccine. The FDA’s findings have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c40629" class="body-heading"&gt;Experts push back&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-707cd0" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts who reviewed the memo say it is misusing information from VAERS, an unverified reporting system that allows anyone, including doctors, patients and caregivers, to submit entries  about adverse events they believe are linked to vaccines. The system’s &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;own website&lt;/a&gt; warns that submissions can contain inaccurate, incomplete or biased information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-925f0d" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is sort of science by press release,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, calling the memo “irresponsible” and “dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a5066" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is a profound revelation,” Prasad wrote in the memo. “For the first time, the U.S. FDA will acknowledge that COVID-19 vaccines have killed American children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e946e8" class="body-graf"&gt;Prasad suggests that the child deaths were tied to myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, but doesn’t include evidence to support the claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c1d2b" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA directed all media inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services. An HHS spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-be31a9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s former vaccine chief who was ousted by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this year, said the agency is misusing the database and the claims are right out of what he calls the “anti-vaccine playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b49966" class="body-graf"&gt;The FDA uses the database to look for early “signals” — patterns that might suggest a possible safety issue, Marks told NBC News. It was one of the tools the agency used to identify a rare blood clotting condition linked to Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s Covid vaccine, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4551e" class="body-graf"&gt;The mRNA Covid vaccines, from Pfizer and Moderna, have also been linked to a small but increased risk of myocarditis in young men. Most cases &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/myocarditis-covid-vaccine-teens-study-rcna60118" target="_blank"&gt;have been found to be mild&lt;/a&gt; and resolve within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e18af0" class="body-graf"&gt;Marks said the FDA is not reviewing new safety reports but instead re-examining older ones and appears to be classifying some of them as vaccine-related. He added that Covid infection is also associated with myocarditis — and is often more severe than cases seen after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4519ab" class="body-graf"&gt;“This memo conveys a very troubling mixture of misrepresentation and lies,” Marks said. “The climate within the agency is incredibly toxic right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a55299" class="body-heading"&gt;Proposed changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c12e2" class="body-graf"&gt;The memo uses highly ideological language, repeatedly characterizing Covid vaccine requirements for schools and employers as “coercive,” calling past agency decisions “dishonest,” and arguing that vaccine regulation “may have harmed more children than we saved.” At one point, Prasad instructs staff who disagree with his conclusions to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fee3fd" class="body-graf"&gt;He outlined a series of proposed changes to how the FDA evaluates vaccines. He said the agency would revisit how annual flu shots are evaluated, calling the current process an “evidence-based catastrophe of low quality evidence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-21292b" class="body-graf"&gt;He also said pneumonia vaccine makers “will have to show their products reduce pneumonia (at least in the post-market setting), and not merely generate antibody titers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-293c74" class="body-graf"&gt;He also claimed the Biden administration dismissed early safety concerns, and criticized former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky for what he described as “dishonest and manipulative” public comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3cb084" class="body-graf"&gt;The memo comes ahead of a two-day CDC vaccine advisory committee meeting next week, when officials are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;scheduled to discuss the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; and the hepatitis B shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4ebbee" class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier this year, the FDA and CDC limited who is eligible to get a Covid vaccine this fall and winter, focusing on people 65 and older and those with medical conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd593d" class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist, has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085"&gt;downplayed the benefits of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and has singled out vaccines made with mRNA as particularly dangerous, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women-cdc-recommendation-rfk-jr-rcna207312"&gt;calling the mRNA Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt; “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f462f" class="body-graf"&gt;In September, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/04/health/video/the-lead-marty-makary-health-rfk-jr-hhs-congress-hearing-jake-tapper"&gt;FDA Commissioner Marty Makary told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that the agency was looking into the deaths of healthy children from the Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6146b4" class="body-graf"&gt;Extensive research has found that the Covid vaccines are safe for children and protect against severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a4053b" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9871947/" target="_blank"&gt;2023 analysis in JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; reviewed 17 studies covering more than 10 million children ages 5 to 11 who got Pfizer’s or Moderna’s Covid vaccines.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;The next new treatment for Alzheimer’s disease may be an already-existing drug, according to a team of researchers in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In a series of experiments, administering an oral dose of an amino acid called arginine, which is already prescribed to treat high blood pressure, was able to suppress the buildup of a protein associated with Alzheimer’s in mice, the scientists report in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019701862500155X?via%3Dihub" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our study demonstrates that arginine can suppress amyloid-beta aggregation both in vitro and in vivo,” study coauthor Yoshitaka Nagai, neuroscientist at Kindai University, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the work. “What makes this finding exciting is that arginine is already known to be clinically safe and inexpensive, making it a highly promising candidate for repositioning as a therapeutic option for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Scientists still don’t understand the underlying cause of Alzheimer’s disease, but amyloid-beta proteins figure somewhere in the question. Though they’re a part of normal brain function, they’re sticky and can clump together to form “plaques” in the brain. These plaques are considered a hallmark of Alzheimer’s, though not all patients with the disease are found to have them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;According to the researchers’ findings, the arginine can help flush these plaques and break them apart. They demonstrated this by feeding mice with amyloid-beta buildup in their brains drinking water and food infused with small doses of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Along with breaking up the buildup, they also found that the mice which were administered arginine showed improved behavior and cognitive performance, suggesting that the drug helped reverse some of the disease’s harmful effects. This was assessed by analyzing how the mice navigated an elevated Y-shaped maze, noting how far the mice traveled and how many times it entered the maze’s “open arms,” a test of a healthy mice’s natural instinct to avoid open spaces and enter enclosed ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Human clinical trials are needed to bear out the medical potential, but the researchers are optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to clinical trials for Alzheimer’s and potentially other related disorders,” Nagai said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Other recent studies have explored promising avenues for treating Alzheimer’s. A team of scientists in China said they were able to almost instantly reverse the disease’s progression &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/nanoparticle-treatment-reverses-alzheimers-mice"&gt;using nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt; injected in their brains that cleared the plaques and led to cognitive improvements. Another team in Japan &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/scientists-reverse-alzheimers-synapse-damage-mice"&gt;used synthetic peptides&lt;/a&gt; to reverse progression in early stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Still, amyloid-beta’s function in the brain in general remains a mystery, and so the jury’s still out on whether targeting them is a meaningful way of treating, let alone curing, the tragic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

His research focuses on how the brain’s neural circuits assemble themselves before sensory experience shapes them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists have known for years that brain activity in adults is not just random noise – it follows structured sequences when animals move, remember, or rest quietly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; in rodents showed that hippocampal cells can “preplay” paths an animal will walk, suggesting activity patterns exist before experiences arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those repeating chains are called neuronal firing sequences (&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/time-cells-in-the-brain-are-key-to-complex-learning/"&gt;NFS&lt;/a&gt;), which are ordered bursts of nerve cell spikes over very short periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are thought to be units the brain uses to send information from one place to another and to stitch events in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have argued over whether these sequences appear only after months of sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharf and his collaborators set out to test if any are present before a brain has had the chance to sense the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-growing-mini-brains"&gt;Growing mini brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle that question, the group turned to organoids that can mimic parts of the human cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41420-023-01523-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; described how these brain cultures capture early developmental stages and are used to study autism and Alzheimer disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32115-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;experiments&lt;/a&gt; from Sharf and colleagues showed that brain organoids form circuits where neurons connect, synchronize, and react to drugs that shift activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings suggested that these models are not just static tissue samples but active networks that can learn and change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1934590919303376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that cortical organoids gradually develop complex oscillatory waves that resemble patterns seen in preterm infant brain recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with the new work, these results strengthen the idea that organoid networks follow internally guided programs as they mature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments, the team grew organoids from human stem cells and placed slices of tissue onto &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-computer-interface-bci-reads-your-innermost-thoughts-and-translates-them-into-text/"&gt;microelectrode arrays&lt;/a&gt;, which are flat chips with many recording sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those arrays let the researchers separate signals from hundreds of neurons at once and follow how each cell fired over minutes of spontaneous activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-brain-circuit-sequences"&gt;Early brain circuit sequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they looked at these recordings, the scientists saw that bursts of activity swept through organoids in ordered steps, rather than as random flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each burst followed a specific schedule, with some neurons firing early and others firing late, forming sequences that match a built in wiring plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within those patterns, the analysis revealed a fraction of cells that fired on every burst in a fixed order, creating backbone for the sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other cells participated sometimes or at varying times, adding flexibility around that backbone so the network could explore combinations without losing its rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of these sequences resembled patterns measured in adult cortex, where spontaneous events outline the range of sensory responses a circuit can produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cells are clearly interacting with each other and forming circuits that self-assemble before we can experience anything from the outside world,” said Sharf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That isolation from outside input means the ordered firing reflects sequence rules encoded in the brain circuit network itself not carved by experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea fits with a view in developmental neuroscience that some circuits start with scaffolds which later get tuned by senses and by learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-lab-to-newborn-mice"&gt;From lab to newborn mice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if patterns arise in brain tissue, the researchers recorded from slices of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mice-capable-empathy/"&gt;somatosensory cortex&lt;/a&gt; in mice, which is tissue that processes touch signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice were at an age when most senses besides smell are still developing, so their cortices had received only limited outside input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those slices, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-decisions-are-shaped-by-optimistic-and-pessimistic-neurons/"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; fired in recurring bursts that unfolded in the same order, with a backbone of cells leading the wave and others joining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That parallel between organoids and living tissue strengthens the case that the underlying sequence rules are built into the way these circuits grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In flat cultures of cortical neurons, the cells produced bursts of activity but lacked the ordered sequences that appeared in organoids and slices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That contrast suggests that having a three-dimensional layout with diverse cell types is important for letting backbone sequences form and persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar timing motifs in lab grown human tissue and early mouse cortex argue that sequence-based organization is a general feature of mammalian brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It supports the idea that evolution has shaped the brain’s neural circuits so they can assemble maps of time, even before an individual encounters the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-of-preconfigured-brains"&gt;Implications of preconfigured brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these mini-brains develop from patient or healthy stem cells, researchers can compare how sequences unfold in organoids from people with different conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a disorder changes when backbone cells fire, or how cells join a sequence, those changes could expose assembly problems before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organoid-based models let scientists probe disorders, including microcephaly and epilepsy, giving access to stages of brain growth that cannot be studied directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding precise measurements of early-firing sequences to that toolkit could help explain why some conditions disturb perception, movement, or cognition from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These recording platforms can track how sequences change after a drug or gene edit, letting researchers search for treatments that restore normal timing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach could be especially valuable for disorders where current medicines blunt symptoms, but don’t correct the underlying wiring problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the organoid recordings, neonatal mouse slices, and flat culture comparisons point to a brain that starts life with preconfigured firing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding those rules could clarify how infants rapidly learn, and could open paths to treating disorders while the brain is still assembling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02111-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Melting potatoes are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High oven heat and flavorful broth create restaurant-quality results at home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple to make, melting potatoes elevate any weeknight meal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Buttery Yukon Golds, fluffy Idaho russets, picturesque red- and blue-skinned beauties … potatoes are not just pretty and delicious, they also pack a surprising nutritional punch, containing a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good amount of potassium&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin C, fiber, a small amount of protein and a handful of antioxidants, among other nutrients.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Originally domesticated in the Andes and brought to Europe in the 1500s, ‘taters are popular worldwide, showing up in meals from places as far flung as India, Finland and Peru. Plus, potatoes keep well, can be found in pretty much any food store and are fairly easy to grow in a home garden. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because potatoes are so beloved—the USDA estimates that Americans consume an average of 50 pounds per year—most home cooks have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/highly-rated-potato-side-dishes-11839320" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;wonderful potato dishes&lt;/a&gt; in their repertoires.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As a youngster, I learned to make tangy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248189/buttermilk-mashed-potatoes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;buttermilk mashed potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8077643/roasted-garlic-butter-potatoes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;roasted potatoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252910/classic-potato-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;classic potato salad&lt;/a&gt;, and all of them were hits. After all, when people are explaining that they’re selective eaters, they often describe themselves as loving “meat and potatoes.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-you-should-try-melting-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Why You Should Try Melting Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When I got older, I started incorporating more chef-y techniques into my cooking, and that’s when I discovered the glory of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/279036/melting-potatoes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;melting potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, or fondant potatoes. Roasted at high heat and then bathed in flavorful broth, the resulting potato pieces are crispy on the outside and beautifully tender in the middle. Adding herbs to the mix, and throwing in some smashed garlic, makes them even more delicious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best part is that melting potatoes are so easy to make. Once you have slices prepped, all you need to do is babysit them while they cook, flip them once and then pour in the broth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-make-melting-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How to Make Melting Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ll begin by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/do-you-really-need-to-preheat-your-oven-8744075" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preheating your oven to 500℉&lt;/a&gt;. It’s pretty common for home cooks to use 350℉ for the majority of their cooking tasks, and this is one way that restaurant chefs set themselves apart. In professional kitchens, cooks vary cooking temperatures widely to meet specific goals. In this case, we’re aiming to get a gorgeous browned exterior on our potato slices, and to cook them quickly, which leads us to use an amped-up oven temp. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the oven heats up, you’ll toss the potatoes with a mixture of olive oil, butter and seasonings, including fresh herbs, salt and pepper. Doing this in a bowl ensures that you can mix the slices around and get all of the sides nice and coated. Then, arrange the potato pieces in a single layer in a metal baking dish—glass isn’t safe to use at higher temperatures—and pop them into the oven.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now’s the time to work on other dinner projects, or simply hang out and do whatever else you want! You’ll cook the potatoes for 15 minutes, flip them with a spatula and then give them another 15 minutes. When you pull out the potatoes halfway through, look at how they’re cooking. If they look uneven, rotate the pan before putting it back into the oven. If they look like they’re getting too dark in spots, perhaps your oven is running a little hot? If that’s the case, you could knock the heat down to 475℉.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When 30 minutes is up, carefully pour the broth into the pan and add the smashed garlic. Pop the ‘taters back into the oven, and continue roasting until the potatoes are tender throughout when you stick a fork into them, and the majority of the broth is absorbed. These are nicest served while piping hot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-fun-variations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Fun Variations &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The truth is, when I make this dish, I skip peeling the potatoes. Not only does it save me some time but it also results in a more nutritious finished product. Plus, I like the way the skins taste when they’re crispy and bathed in herby broth. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you’re comfortable with the “high heat plus liquid” methodology, you can start playing around with different seasonings. Try adding sage, parsley and thyme to the herb mix, and consider using different fats that are safe for higher-heat cooking, including avocado oil, refined sunflower oil or safflower oil. Spices can burn at higher temperatures, so if I want to add smoked paprika or chili powder, I’ll add it toward the end of the cooking time or sprinkle it on just before serving. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another way to change up the flavor is to mix a zingy, acidic liquid in with the broth. A small splash of vinegar, wine or citrus juice will brighten up the end result remarkably, as in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/281569/lemon-rosemary-melting-potatoes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lemon-Rosemary Melting Potatoes&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sprinkling on a bit of cheese for the final few minutes of roasting, like we do when making &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/280315/garlic-parmesan-melting-potatoes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Garlic-Parmesan Melting Potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, is another excellent move. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/french-onion-melting-potatoes-11844097" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;French Onion Melting Potatoes&lt;/a&gt;, with rich beef broth and Gruyère cheese, are even more decadent. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Melting potatoes are so delicious that your other accompanying dishes can be fairly simple. While the potatoes are in the oven, I might whip up a stovetop seafood dish, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275030/seared-scallops-with-white-bean-ragu-charred-lemon/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Seared Scallops with White Bean Ragu &amp;amp; Charred Lemon&lt;/a&gt;, which sounds fancy but takes only 25 minutes, or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/279114/spice-seared-salmon-with-greek-style-green-beans/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Spice Seared Salmon with Greek-Style Green Beans&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By using high heat to roast the potatoes and then adding liquid for the last few minutes of cooking, you’ll end up with slices that are browned and crispy but nicely cooked all the way through. The broth, which will pick up all of the lovely herbs from the pan and become infused with the flavor of garlic, turns into a sauce as liquid is absorbed by the potatoes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, melting potatoes are a perfect fusion of home cooking simplicity and restaurant kitchen technique, which yields an extraordinarily delicious product quickly, with just a handful of common ingredients, and using only a single bowl and pan.&lt;br&gt;

After brief stimulation, participants learned faster from positive feedback and repeated rewarding choices more consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects mirrored key aspects of surgical deep brain stimulation but without implants or incisions. The findings suggest ultrasound could become a safer, personalized tool for reshaping faulty reward circuits in mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deep Brain Targeting:&lt;/strong&gt; Ultrasound successfully modulated the nucleus accumbens without surgery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Reward Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants showed increased sensitivity to positive outcomes after stimulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The technique may one day aid treatment for addiction, depression, and eating disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Plymouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nucleus accumbens is a tiny element of the human brain triggered when we experience something enjoyable, and used to help us learn behaviours that lead to rewards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has shown for the first time that its influence on human behaviour can be altered using transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying the technique for just over a minute at a time, researchers were able to influence how people learned the links between certain cues and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result was that they were more likely to repeat a choice that had previously paid off, their learning rates following positive outcomes increased and they were more likely to make positive choices more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, such outcomes have only been achieved through surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), which involves electrodes being directly attached to areas within a person’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, those involved in the current study say their findings could signal that TUS has the potential to be used as an equally beneficial – and non-invasive – alternative to help those impacted by neurological or psychiatric disorders including addictions, depression and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; and was led by researchers from the University of Plymouth. It also involved the University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, Brown University, and the VA Providence Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Elsa Fouragnan, Director of the Centre for Therapeutic Ultrasound and the Brain Research and Imaging Centre (BRIC) at the University of Plymouth, led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: “For decades, the nucleus accumbens has sat at the centre of theories of motivation and reinforcement learning. It is the hub where dopamine signals and limbic inputs converge to shape how strongly rewards pull our choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to pinpoint a clear link between a specific learning trait, tied to impulsivity, and a structure that until now could not be reached without surgery. The fact that we can now modulate this area non-invasively, and in a personalised manner, opens extraordinary possibilities for clinical translation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study forms part of ongoing and pioneering research taking place at the University of Plymouth into the benefits of TUS for conditions including anxiety and depression, addiction and other neurological or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this project, the researchers recruited 26 healthy participants who visited the BRIC facility four times – once to plan their TUS intervention, followed by three sessions where TUS was applied to different parts of their brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 10 minutes after the ultrasound intervention, participants were placed in the scanner to perform a series of tasks over the space of an hour while the research team monitored changes in their behaviour and brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants’ performance in the tasks was also cross-checked against that of patients with bilateral deep brain stimulation electrodes targeted to the nucleus accumbens as part of therapies for treatment-resistant anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that while DBS often normalises reward-seeking behaviour, TUS had an opposite and excitatory effect – however, both result in people’s learning and reward sensitivity being altered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Fouragnan added: “This study is the most significant I have had the privilege to lead so far. We uncovered a clear link between a specific cognitive process and a deep-brain structure that, until now, was beyond reach without surgery. It marks a turning point for neurotechnology, showing that a non-invasive ultrasound approach can influence behaviour and may one day help restore mental balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764438621046"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What part of the brain did scientists influence with ultrasound?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: A deep reward center called the nucleus accumbens that guides motivation and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764438622362"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What changed after stimulation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: People learned faster from positive outcomes and repeated rewarding choices more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1764438622189"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How is this different from past methods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Similar effects previously required invasive brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee8f828f80c099878282878f839dae9e829783819b9a86c08f8dc09b85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plymouth.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;University of Plymouth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alan Williams – University of Plymouth&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-65080-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Non-invasive ultrasonic neuromodulation of the human nucleus accumbens impacts reward sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;” by Elsa Fouragnan et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-invasive ultrasonic neuromodulation of the human nucleus accumbens impacts reward sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precisely neuromodulating deep brain regions could bring transformative advancements in both neuroscience and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We demonstrate that non-invasive transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) can selectively modulate deep brain activity and affect learning and decision making, comparable to deep brain stimulation (DBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested whether TUS could causally influence neural and behavioural responses by targeting the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) using a reinforcement learning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-six healthy adults completed a within-subject TUS–fMRI experiment with three conditions: TUS to the NAcc, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), or Sham. After TUS, participants performed a probabilistic learning task during fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TUS-NAcc altered BOLD responses to reward expectation in the NAcc and surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also affected reward-related behaviours, including win–stay strategy use, learning rate following rewards, learning curves, and repetition rates of rewarded choices. DBS-NAcc perturbed the same features, confirming target engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings establish TUS as a viable approach for non-invasive deep-brain neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 17:54:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE52RFFzYmo3aURFTE54VFk2MnMwcDU1TWhRaXd3bFFHOXZPSXdVWjVSZ20zTXdrVmZQS24xWjhEcGpZWkZXY2gwNzRJdi1PVkhzaHVVQS1pS3A4WDNobG5zZjdNcmJERU5XN0JUbjAyajB1Wlk</guid></item><item><title>这种疾病无法治愈，它突然再次迅速蔓延- MSN</title><link>https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/this-disease-has-no-cure-and-it-s-suddenly-spreading-fast-again/ar-AA1Ro5z5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Many people with severe bulimia end up with dental decay but luckily, somehow my teeth are OK and there’s no lasting damage to my body. I have issues with alcohol too and have been in and out of rehab for many years. My worst alcohol binge was after my father died – I just couldn’t cope with the agony of losing someone I loved so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a period of four days, I lost control and drank 17 bottles of wine. For some reason, maybe to shock myself into getting better, I even photographed all the bottles I drank. I was in self-destruct mode and ended up being hospitalised with liver poisoning. The nurses were so worried, explaining that I’d nearly killed myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve never attempted suicide and I wasn’t trying to die – I just feel emotions so deeply, I find it hard to manage them. I know I’ll never go back to that dark place again, as something has shifted within me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The agony of grief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my father died, I agreed that a filmmaker could follow me in the studio for a year. It ended up being very painful and triggering, but ultimately cathartic. The director, Shafin Basheer, was a lovely, gentle guy and we became good friends. The film, &lt;em&gt;Life with Emotions&lt;/em&gt;, was about my father having Parkinson’s, but it also followed me through my grief. It won awards and helped raise money for the charity Parkinson’s UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During filming, my bulimia got dramatically worse, but it also forced me to look at myself and face my demons. It has always been a kind of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/03/12/time-dispel-stigma-surrounds-addiction/"&gt;dysfunctional coping strategy for my emotions, as all addictions are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back now, I’m horrified that my bulimia made me 4st overweight. I look so unhappy and unhealthy in the film. I’m 6ft 4in and my natural weight is 16st 7lb, but I weighed nearly 20st.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching it at the launch recently made me cry. It was so emotional because I was intensely focused on making a sculpture of my father throughout the film. It was a powerful way of saying goodbye, but I also found it very hard to physically let go of the sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;

But before understanding how turmeric works, it helps to know what &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is your body’s way of protecting itself from harmful things like infections or injuries. “The immune system initiates an inflammatory response by gathering immune cells to the impacted area to heal it or fight off an infection,” says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/plantbased.and.intuitive/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shannon Costello, RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shannon Costello, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bright yellow spice—widely used in South Asian and Southeast Asian cooking, and in some Middle Eastern dishes—contains a compound called curcumin that’s been studied for its ability to help calm chronic inflammation in the body. So yes—one spice really can make a difference. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/amazon-black-friday-kitchen-deals-2025-11833046" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 66 Best Amazon Early Cyber Monday Kitchen Deals Start at Just $7—Save on Top Brands Like Le Creuset and Ninja;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 66 Best Amazon Early Cyber Monday Kitchen Deals Start at Just $7—Save on Top Brands Like Le Creuset and Ninja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Turmeric Can Help with Inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/turmeric-benefits-8785974" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:main active compound in turmeric;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;main active compound in turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, is responsible for the spice’s &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects&lt;/a&gt;. Although the mechanisms are complex, research suggests curcumin may help protect healthy cells during an inflammatory response, says Costello.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show a strong link between curcumin and reduced inflammation. Curcumin targets several inflammatory pathways and may be useful as part of a treatment approach for inflammatory conditions, such as arthritis and psoriasis. It may also help lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), which Costello explains is a blood protein that increases in response to inflammation. This is important to keep in mind, as high levels of CRP in the blood can be a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669105/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:marker of chronic inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;marker of chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food Sources vs Supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While turmeric adds curcumin to your diet, the amount found in food is typically much lower than the doses used in research on inflammatory conditions. That’s why supplements may offer stronger effects than turmeric alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, adding turmeric to your meals is one doable move you can make to potentially decrease the inflammatory load on your body. If you have a condition where inflammation affects symptoms or severity, then you may find that adding turmeric to your meals as part of &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-to-make-first-8770807" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:an overall anti-inflammatory eating plan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;an overall anti-inflammatory eating plan&lt;/a&gt; makes a difference for you. It’s important, though, to stick with any current treatment plan; turmeric is not a replacement for medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Add a Pinch of Pepper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cooking with turmeric it’s smart to include a small pinch of ground black pepper. Black pepper contains piperine, a natural compound that &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-ingredient-to-combine-with-turmeric-11694659" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:helps your body absorb curcumin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;helps your body absorb curcumin&lt;/a&gt;, the key active ingredient in turmeric. Without piperine, much of the curcumin passes through the body unused, so pairing the two can significantly boost its effectiveness. If taking a curcumin supplement, make sure it includes piperine (or black pepper) in the list of ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Enjoy Turmeric for Anti-Inflammatory Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is easy to work into your day, whether you’re cooking, drinking it or using it as a natural color booster. Its earthy, slightly bitter flavor pairs well with both sweet and savory foods, and a little goes a long way. You can stir ground turmeric into smoothies, oatmeal, yogurt bowls, soups, rice dishes, stir-fries, sauces and salad dressings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In drinks, try whisking turmeric into warm milk or non-dairy milk for a simple &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258547/turmeric-latte/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turmeric latte;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;turmeric latte&lt;/a&gt;, or add it to &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259696/soothing-ginger-lemon-tea/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hot water with lemon and ginger;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;hot water with lemon and ginger&lt;/a&gt; for a soothing tea-like beverage.

While the amount you get from food is lower than supplement doses, using turmeric regularly—especially with black pepper—may support the body’s natural inflammatory response. It’s not a cure or a replacement for medication, but it can be a flavorful and helpful addition to meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-spice-to-decrease-inflammation-11846872" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 15:46:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOdkcta0hsdXBzYmZWVFhBM2loZVpWYVRYalJUel9DeS04SmM3Wm5vRDhoeU1Wa2Y3RlJCZkpIU0Zmd0R4M2hoMW8yUUNvdXlsNF83SHBfU1JVaTY2dVRGUk4yNHFnUzNDdlNVbExmejJhVjhIQkdTZDRScWdZZXZkeWZnbXhPbkc3bWJzYlBUTQ</guid></item><item><title>古巴的健康危机-《哈瓦那时报》</title><link>https://havanatimes.org/diaries/safie-m-gonzalez/the-health-crisis-in-cuba/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="cm-entry-summary"&gt;

&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;a href="https://havanatimes.org/category/diaries/safie.m.gonzalez/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Safie M. Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HAVANA TIMES – In every corner of the island, daily life unfolds under an alert triggered by the buzz of the mosquito — no longer just a nuisance, but a constant reminder of a threat that has gained strength. The spread of Chikungunya, along with Dengue, Oropouche, and Zika, has exposed deep flaws in the country’s health infrastructure and in the State’s ability to respond, revealing a crisis that extends far beyond the presence of the mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.48_c1cdd40b-450x600.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-238873" srcset="https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.48_c1cdd40b-450x600.jpg 450w, https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.48_c1cdd40b-600x800.jpg 600w, https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.48_c1cdd40b.jpg 720w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Inflamación causada por el virus&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain With a Name: Arbovirosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya, a word in the Kimakonde language meaning “to bend over in pain,” is not a passing discomfort. Those infected describe a burning sensation that travels through bones and joints, immobilizing them. The Pan American Health Organization warns that many patients develop chronic joint pain that lasts months or even years. In a country with an aging population and deteriorated nutrition, the aftereffects become an almost unbearable burden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.48_1e7c7c14-517x600.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-238870" srcset="https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.48_1e7c7c14-517x600.jpg 517w, https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.48_1e7c7c14-689x800.jpg 689w, https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.48_1e7c7c14.jpg 720w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Fumigation is the main response to the epidemic.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Failure of Fumigation: Fuel That Evaporates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fumigation, presented as the government’s main tool, has become a meaningless exercise. The fuel assigned to it is very often diverted to the black market, leaving brigades that fumigate irregularly and with diluted products. It is a symbolic, not effective, defense — something that satisfies a statistic but protects no one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.47_e67f4aa6-600x338.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-238871" srcset="https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.47_e67f4aa6-600x338.jpg 600w, https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.08.47_e67f4aa6.jpg 736w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Medicines are in great shortage at the state pharmacies.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic Breeding Grounds: The Great Lie of Individual Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The official campaign insists: “Cover your tank, turn over your bucket…” But shifting the blame onto citizens is a strategy designed to hide state responsibility. The real massive breeding grounds are structural. First, micro-dumps — mountains of garbage that remain uncollected for weeks. Second, leaks from broken pipes create permanent pools of water that are perfect for mosquito reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A bucket can produce hundreds of larvae. A micro-dump, by contrast, millions. Yet the individual is still indirectly blamed under the pretext of raising awareness — a way to avoid acknowledging the real and most powerful cause of the generation and expansion of this health crisis, disguising the State’s inability to maintain basic services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of this is accompanied by uncertain diagnoses: in Cuba, the necessary tests to identify the type of arbovirus are not done due to a lack of reagents. Every diagnosis is clinical — an approximation that hides the true scope of the epidemic. In parallel, medicines are found only on the black market: steroids, IV fluids, painkillers, etc., have disappeared from state pharmacies. Their prices in the informal market are unaffordable for the vast majority. Another undeniable factor worsening the health situation is the accelerated loss of professionals, which has left technical and human gaps that the system can no longer fill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-medium is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.10.13_7c2e922e-600x450.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-238872" srcset="https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.10.13_7c2e922e-600x450.jpg 600w, https://havanatimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-28-at-13.10.13_7c2e922e.jpg 736w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-medium-font-size"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bureaucracy Above Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going to the doctor does not guarantee treatment; it only guarantees a work certificate. Bureaucracy demands paperwork even when no relief can be offered. People with high fevers stand in line to justify an absence from work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Official reports are scarce, incomplete, and late. Most sick people never appear in the statistics. People prefer to endure the illness at home, self-medicating. A parallel epidemic has emerged — one the State does not acknowledge, but which lives and hurts in every Cuban household.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The arbovirus crisis in Cuba reflects a deeper deterioration: structural failures, mismanagement, and the abandonment of basic functions. While the State urges people to cover tanks and turn over buckets, the population faces alone an epidemic that is, in reality, the visible consequence of disastrous state management.&lt;/p&gt;

No longer living strictly in African forests and biting only wild animals, these mosquitoes have evolved to prefer feeding on humans and now transmit viral diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya across tropical and subtropical regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to researcher Jacob Crawford, dengue transmission is now 50 to 100 times more common than it was just five decades ago, with 4 billion people at risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There are over 3,500 species of mosquitoes, but one species, Aedes aegypti, is responsible for almost all types of dengue," Crawford &lt;a href="https://www.georgetown.edu/news/how-did-dengue-mosquitoes-go-global/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; his alma mater, Georgetown University, in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Crawford and Georgetown professor Peter Armbruster recently led a genome sequencing project that analyzed over 1,200 mosquitoes from 74 locations worldwide. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads3732" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Science in September, trace how Aedes aegypti spread from Africa to the Americas and evolved to thrive in cities, breeding in transport containers and developing resistance to insecticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The global spread of Aedes aegypti is a key example of how rising temperatures and urbanization are fueling increased disease risks. As warmer, wetter conditions enable mosquitoes to survive in areas once less suitable for them, outbreaks of dengue and other diseases are appearing in more regions each year, presenting new threats in countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At the same time, we may lose some of our best tools in the fight against mosquito-borne infections. Increased outbreaks may lead to greater insecticide use, potentially raising the risk of resistance in these highly adaptable insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about mosquito-borne illnesses?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Crawford hopes the genomic data from his research will help researchers develop new tools to manage the spread of diseases like dengue," the university's release explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Crawford's research was completed through his work at &lt;a href="https://debug.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Debug;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Debug&lt;/a&gt;, a mosquito-control initiative at Google.

In the conclusion of their paper in Science, the co-authors noted that their dataset "will help understand and manage the spread of resistance and enable new tools to be developed in the fight to reduce the burden of dengue and other mosquito-borne viruses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are practical steps you can take to reduce the presence of mosquitoes in your yard and near your home: eliminating standing water, selecting native plants that deter mosquitoes, using screens and repellents, wearing pants and long-sleeve shirts when possible, and &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-your-voice/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supporting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;supporting&lt;/a&gt; public health initiatives that prioritize clean water access and disease surveillance are all actions that can help make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;��&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Get TCD's &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/newsletter/?utm_source=rec0CxYcKuAbCW1fY" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletters;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletters&lt;/a&gt; for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive &lt;a href="https://links.thecooldown.com/rewards-club" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rewards Club;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Rewards Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPaHZkWFVrVVhWV0dyNUxmbW9fUG9na2RTaU96M3hmaHlqZk00R1VNMzdJbWlEclZuS0dBVV94SldCcUhsTXd1dG9PZHVQTV9EZTdNMHo1ZHlQMU9LTWV4dy0wUzdFS2hwcjlvOFhSYWIwYm9qdmFrZy0tSDRvWk5ERkozOHd0OFExTlBBdXVTZVF5enlQTVJaTHpB</guid></item></channel></rss>
