In total, biopsies from more than 4,000 men will be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool, which analyses digitised biopsy images to produce a personalised risk score, has already &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/30/new-ai-test-can-predict-which-men-will-benefit-from-prostate-cancer-drug" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;been shown in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to identify which men with high-risk prostate cancer would be most likely to benefit from the drug abiraterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, trials in the US have suggested it could also be used for less aggressive forms of prostate cancer to predict which men are most likely to benefit from having hormone therapy in addition to radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition, studies have suggested the tool can help identify which patients can be monitored without the need for immediate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “If and when this gets implemented, you could use one tool irrespective of where you are on the aggressiveness scale, to make a very clinically and life-enhancingly important decision for each of those men.”. He added that the tool was already being widely used in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new study will first use prostate biopsy samples from men who have already been diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer, and have suitable follow-up data, to explore whether the predictive prowess of the tool is seen when applied to UK patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool will then be tested at three sites – North Bristol NHS trust, Oxford University hospitals NHS foundation trust, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde – as men undergo the normal pathway for prostate cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Biopsies will be analysed, the treatment choices will be made, and the man will start treatment. But at the same time, the NHS clinicians will be given a readout from this tool and asked: ‘If you had this, would you have recommended the same treatment or not?’” said Hobbs, adding that part of the trial would also explore to what extent the tool affected the time between diagnosis and treatment choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say the hope is that the tool will eventually help reduce under- and over-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A good outcome from this is that this tool is implemented in the NHS,” said Hobbs. However, for that to happen, he said, it had to be shown to be scientifically valid, cost-effective, and making a difference to treatment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Gerhardt Attard, from University College London, who was involved in the study around abiraterone use but is not part of the trial, said the research was important as approaches often worked well in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When you take that to the real NHS world, there are a number of challenges and differences that would inevitably arise and that’s what this study will address,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ashley Dalton, the minister for public health and prevention, also welcomed the trial. “This groundbreaking research could be a huge step forward, demonstrating the power of technology to potentially transform lives and improve cancer outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is exactly why we’re investing in a digital NHS. By harnessing AI and moving beyond outdated systems, we can transform cancer care – diagnosing earlier, treating more effectively, and improving patient experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNVWY3RlFVcm1ZTXBTSGpCMjlKcnprNnNSMl9xS0ZFblhZaXZuRmRQdnJGUXNXN2FoMHdaTDFSaVF1RUlsRHpOZ2ZoTGM1RVJzdTBHVVZVUF9fUldwQjlfYWt6aUhpaGtDb0hXQXBlVkJ4bkhvODU3MklQM0k2T2ZvNmdTS1NDbkFDOGhxVl84c0xiQ2dpNTN5QzJLUFhHbnRUcWhmTzZpamxkV19rNEZQTEtYSENVSkFmWkdVcUN2UlI</guid></item><item><title>为什么这项临床试验给一些年轻的癌症患者带来了希望-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2025/11/01/children-cancer-clinical-trial-solid-tumors/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWE7YLHN5FDZTERD72FTOVOQAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Years of caring for children with solid tumors and looking into the eyes of parents starved for hope have led Catherine Bollard to what she calls the most important moment of her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VSXFKHFQRBIVJKFKFQS7DT2RE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children’s National Hospital, where Bollard is senior vice president and chief research officer, is poised to start recruiting children with pediatric sarcomas and other solid tumors that have resisted chemotherapy and radiation for a clinical trial that will use an inventive new technique to combat one of the most persistent problems in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 17:00:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNOEFYb3RIRUZNbEx3Y0RHeGQ0eVJ6OWk5U3FkYkp0S2xibm16TWszazJWVUtUUUlMV2IwQ1Z5RllrODdiWjZmZVoxcTljSXVjZHZMeklUYXZDMVdEc3QtMENuYk9Cemh1ajlNWkx4UFpNMFNrNG5IM2Z4V1Rsd1RwbHNEUW4zcndWZk9LMGtjTUxkUXhTYmhGQVBB</guid></item><item><title>不仅仅是油炸食品！血管外科医生警告6种常见食物会增加心脏病发作的风险-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/not-just-fried-food-vascular-surgeon-warns-of-6-common-foods-that-raise-heart-attack-risk/articleshow/125032461.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to heart health, it is not always the obvious dangers that harm us; it is the everyday food items that we eat, without a second thought. The symptoms for heart-related problems are not dramatic as much; they are slow, silent, and gradually build up in our arteries that can lead to a life-changing event. Vascular surgeon, Dr. Sumit Kapadia, with 18 years of experience, cautions that even the foods that we find comforting might quietly be increasing the risk of heart attacks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shockingly, it's not just fried rare treats or greasy food-seemingly harmless staples and trendy packaged foods open the gateway to arterial damage. The danger lies in how these six food groups, cherished and widely consumed, quietly raise blood pressure, blood sugar, and inflammation until your arteries cry out for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Seven Daily Habits to Prevent Heart Attacks Revealed &amp;amp; Boost Heart Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Processed Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed items like seekh kebabs, sausages, salami, and mutton curries are full of saturated fat and sodium. With time, these foods harden the arteries and provoke inflammation, acting as a main reason for heart problems. High saturated fat levels gradually lead to a buildup of cholesterol in the arteries, while too much sodium increases blood pressure, both of which contribute to arterial hardening and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What starts as an occasional indulgence can, over the years, turn into a major risk factor if not balanced with healthier choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fried street food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samosas, pakoras, bhajiyas, puris, and French fries aren’t just tempting; they’re risky when cooked in reused oils, which produce dangerous trans fats. These fats do more than just clog your arteries; they accelerate plaque buildup and amplify the risk of heart attacks, even in the young and healthy. Reused oils produce trans fat, a harmful type that clogs the arteries and also triggers inflammation and plaque buildup inside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Refined carbs &amp;amp; maida-based food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our favourite food options, like white bread, naan, pav, biscuits, pastries, and bakery puff, are prepared with refined flour-also known as maida or refined flour. These quickly raise blood sugar levels and initiate body-wide inflammation, promoting the development of cholesterol-rich plaques in the heart arteries. Over time, these constant fluctuations can lead to insulin resistance and chronic inflammation throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweetened drinks &amp;amp; packaged juices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-loaded colas, energy drinks, canned fruit juices, and flavored lassis might sound refreshing, but they raise triglyceride levels and put additional pressure on your heart. Consuming these drinks daily has been related to the risk of sudden cardiac death as they interfere with heart rhythm and blood lipids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High salt in pickles, namkee, and other foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian meals are always full of pickles, 'papad', instant noodles, chips, and salty snacks, all loaded with sodium. High intake of salt retains water in your body and heightens blood pressure, inviting heart attacks and strokes. This is the risk which, for many, lies hidden in the taste of daily favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, instant noodles, frozen parathas, ready-to-eat curries, chips, and packaged sauces come packed with hidden fats, sugar, and preservatives. Each serving of ultra-processed food can increase your heart risk by an alarming 7 percent—proof that convenience at the cost of health is rarely worth it in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warning that can save lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice of Dr. Kapadia is the same, yet very powerful: avoid these six food groups and shut the entrance door to future heart attacks. Every meal we eat might be small, last a few minutes, but it requires us to make powerful choices that shape our heart's future. Let those choices be guided by awareness and balance. A little mindfulness goes a long way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choices you make at every meal quietly shape your cardiovascular fate, so let wisdom guide your plate. Even amidst cultural traditions and busy lifestyles, mindful eating can safeguard your heart and keep the silent dangers at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAJBVV95cUxNTE9TWEE4QnNib001cW5nRE5qY2hSeWo3SGM1SWtpcDYyM0VpRnpXZWd5RklsVDRGU2JfbzBSNlJVdnVJYVY3UWpqQlNDMVRDRjZqMGtsTC1ZN05ucXRxSlRIQ0VJRUp4VGxKbGNoYm5QZlN4TUNMejBJU01hTTV4TmpDUDhuQmFtdm14Qk9vY2NFMnh5eXRRMVdFenRTWFJwUmtlck1PSFp3dnhHOTYycGdUZ3BlT2lpTzNpNFR2bFlRR096Y1hiTUZpUEhqdmg4eHdvV0czempoT2hDclZZbnZ3T2VhaUF0YV9uMlZrdzNGZ2FmM0lwNDBTMm42b1Z5STJCM25FQzc</guid></item><item><title>我们与另一对已婚夫妇度过了一个狂野的夜晚。一个丈夫为错误的人参加了狂欢节。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/11/alcohol-husband-sex-drinking-group-wife-advice.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9ftt2001f3b787crws39m@published"&gt;Let’s say you’re in a couple play situation where there is lots of alcohol involved and one husband is feral for the other guy’s wife, to the exclusion of everything else. If his wife is upset by this, and there is almost zero chance the drinking will be less, it seems like continuing the play another time will just lead to more hurt. Is there a way through this? The husband is not interested in moving forward if his wife is hurt by his drunken behavior, but is it worth trying again if his intent is to be more conscious of how his wife is doing during play?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9ftze001h3b78c9cv14jp@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Tunnel Vision,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu2o001i3b78o1i8xdlh@published"&gt;I think the most prudent thing to do here is to consider what the emotional fallout will be if the same thing were to happen again. You’ve written your letter in a hypothetical voice without identifying yourself, which is uncommon for this column, but I have a hunch that if you’re in this configuration, you’re the wife. If that is true, envision what a scenario will be like if your husband follows the same pattern. Will it be upsetting, devastating, relationship-upending? Something else? What exactly would you be risking if the worst-case scenario were to play out?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu5j001j3b78b9mcmkky@published"&gt;One positive here is that the husband no longer can claim plausible deniability should he zero in on a single target and others’ feelings catch strays in the process. He knows what happened last time. If alcohol clouded his judgement, he should take it upon himself to drink less—if getting loaded in the presence of available alcohol (and nonmonogamous sex) is an inevitability, that may signal an issue with substances or a general discomfort with this kind of play. Both should be interrogated. I know people love to get drunk and screw, but if they &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; get drunk to screw, they might want to think about why and consider other means of social lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu91001k3b78jzdthyr0@published"&gt;Another positive here is that he actively does not want to upset his wife again, which suggests he’s learning. Now is the time for the wife to voice her boundaries and for him to accept them. If these are successfully adhered to, you will both have grown from a negative situation, perhaps rendering it all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fuc7001l3b783575zfk0@published"&gt;So, I say give him another chance unless you (I mean … the wife) are fairly sure that a repetition of the first time will cause irreparable damage. Obviously, he’s extremely into another woman there and part of the point of this kind of play is for people to have their fun. But it truly should not be to the exclusion of everything else, including consideration for one’s partner. If he truly cannot maintain that very meager standard, this kind of play should probably be taken off the table entirely. But you should also consider the fact that his interest for at least one other woman will likely endure whether you go forward and incorporate her into group sex or not. If the very fact of his attraction is bothersome or distracting, it may deserve a sober discussion and your own efforts to come to terms with it.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t enjoy anal, either. I love closeness and intimacy, including kissing and cuddling, and I am happy to give orally, but getting my dick sucked does nothing for me, nor does penetrating another guy and nor does bottoming. None of it is uncomfortable and I enjoy giving pleasure to others, but none of it is as satisfying as masturbation. Is there something wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9q76u002x3b78smjbc3oi@published"&gt;There’s a good chance there’s nothing “wrong” with you here. Maybe this is just how you are, and all the psychological searching you can muster (alone and/or with a therapist) won’t give you any answers. Maybe you just know what you like and what you don’t. Giving pleasure is a great thing, and there are guys who identify as cocksuckers who know this well. If masturbation is your primary vehicle for pleasure, maybe you’re a bator. Maybe you are somewhere on the asexuality spectrum (some deep thinking on the subject, by reading a book like Angela Chen’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Asexuality-Reveals-Identity-Meaning-ebook/dp/B07Y7H1WT9/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kUEjXggB_7ggqNfz6k5l9CeMsuUoEMrPtAf932EMoLkRyJt6T1oNSaxDjzaUcPCOq_oYAMscOBxFhdZleUV1LR82ic00Rf3f9R6vBc4xHiqVBPMyR7Bmf7ZiSoYVFfRLif6TptxOirtny5lNPHmXyg.R-bIgGONNmYTuYiVCC65wBJvxqdmM7QGNVgmJnemEHA&amp;amp;qid=1761851333&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or browsing/participating in the discussion at &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/"&gt;r/asexuality&lt;/a&gt; could be useful). Maybe none of these labels appeal to you. My sense is that you’re navigating your body’s responses to sex very well and still finding activities that are fun. If you can be at peace with where you are sexually, that’s more than can be said for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9q76u002y3b78bae8cffj@published"&gt;If, however, this is distressing and something you’d like to work on changing, definitely seek the services of a therapist (preferably a sex therapist, or even a sex coach) who can help you sort out whether these feelings might be a response to something that’s happened in your life or just a regular facet of your particular sexuality. There are no guarantees that you will be changed by the process—nor do I think you need to be—but the more you think about it and the more you attempt to work on it, the more likely such a change will occur. We can’t say for certain what’s going on from here, but if you’ve exhausted all potential reasons and this continues to bother you, you may want to look into whether what you’re experiencing is sexual anhedonia, a condition marked by an inability to feel sexual pleasure. It has many &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a43455963/sexual-anhedonia/"&gt;potential causes&lt;/a&gt;, physical (like low testosterone, neurological issues, or medication) and psychological (depression, performance anxiety), alike. A visit to a doctor, hopefully one with whom you are comfortable discussing sex, may be illuminating. Let them know what’s going on, as they may want to run tests.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s been begging to try this since early on in our relationship. I’ve always hesitated because it took me a while to open up to and get comfortable with being eaten out in the first place. With butt stuff, I’m especially nervous because of cleanliness issues even after a shower. What if it smells or he gets dirty or it’s gross! I don’t want to turn him off entirely! But I also admit I’m curious about it and think I could be into it. How do I get past my fears and give this a shot?&lt;/p&gt;

Things that may complicate this solution include stray hairs that poop can cling to (especially if you are less than thorough with your wash) and fecal incontinence. If you have no reason to suspect you experience the latter (and you’d know), you’re already ahead of the game. To keep things extra tidy, you can trim the hair around your hole (I personally trust the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CLWH333W/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_plhdr=t&amp;amp;aaxitk=28a358c8be016b730e11e90c73409006&amp;amp;hsa_cr_id=0&amp;amp;qid=1761506763&amp;amp;sr=1-1-9e67e56a-6f64-441f-a281-df67fc737124&amp;amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_dlcd_asin_0_title&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=VlfpI&amp;amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.9f2b2b9e-47e9-4764-a4dc-2be2f6fca36d:amzn1.sym.9f2b2b9e-47e9-4764-a4dc-2be2f6fca36d&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=9f2b2b9e-47e9-4764-a4dc-2be2f6fca36d&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=3HKJH7ES5X9X4QSPK0QM&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=JCM99&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=70b7d3bc-1c66-4571-9284-87e350b0597b"&gt;Philips Norelco OneBlade Intimate&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s never nicked me unlike virtually every other shaver I’ve used, even ones marketed for “intimate” areas). I think some would douche in a situation like this, though it’s probably overkill in your case. Still, if you fear there’s any poop lingering around your rectum that may present itself during play, washing out a few times with water (filter it if you’re using tap and the water in your area isn’t suited for drinking) with a small bulb (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Men-Detachable-Reusable-Capacity/dp/B0C6B2B35B/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.c8CU8QHctZ3sGts0WvMHmvu6QH0tc5liZAZiOcWJEsd2So5iHTlt6ZDVvMduKgaAYjDVxOWW9RS-YTDOHHVzg38iNlfH07YWYroNtbvx6Td4vy8vE5a4QqG_aLGvKwcohX_8ROAG3oW3F8vvqXiro1KtF9Vuofmy1HC-edQC8j5Mw3cNzdHKTAIWeIQgQ7nsZgtc6Bvj_-e12VFNmedQ8fUx8zKym5164SI1gNL_xzEACqHIa8bWe6RnSKvDeFHvXW9GaBmGSvACEn1r2l3rr2uk6Os_9MeH_hkRX_payKM.oMYVURE242HER0a2ad8fv2qPX0MAs70fvCf-b5A6GF4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=stay+ready+douche&amp;amp;qid=1761506961&amp;amp;sr=8-8"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) may help you feel hygienically secure.

A mishap is unlikely to turn him off entirely. Or if it does, then you’d be no worse off than you are now—at least you will have tried this thing that you’re both curious about. So try to put those concerns out of your mind if you’re going to go forward with this. Probably the most effective thing you can do is just go through with it—take necessary steps to clean yourself as much as possible and let him have at it. You may gain a lot of confidence and security when the ass eating goes off without a hitch. It’ll show you that you can do this and make next time even easier to get into. Of course, if you do feel discomfort, unclean or any kind of vague negativity, you have every right to stop the session, but I would follow my curiosity if I were &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s because I’m lucky enough to orgasm in that way. Occasionally, I’ll have an enjoyable orgasm that’s a little more restrained. But for the most part, I’m full-on Meg Ryan in the restaurant scene in &lt;em&gt;When Harry met Sally&lt;/em&gt;, except mine is real and not at all a performance. I realize this is the opposite of a problem. However, my question is: &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/loud-climax-sex-advice.html"&gt;Have most or even all of my partners assumed I’m probably faking it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Through in-depth interviews, researchers found that these experiences often begin in childhood, are felt as a deep, internal sensation, and can be integrated into a person’s sexual life. This work builds on more than a decade of research that challenges the common understanding of orgasm as a strictly sexual event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted by a team at The Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University, led by Debby Herbenick, a prominent sexuality researcher. The scientific rationale for these studies stems from a desire to understand the full spectrum of human orgasmic response. Before this work began, the phenomenon was mostly a subject of popular curiosity, often called a “coregasm” in magazines and online forums because of its frequent association with abdominal workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While orgasm is almost exclusively discussed in sexual contexts, historical medical literature and early sexuality research, like the Kinsey reports, had occasionally noted orgasms occurring during non-sexual activities. However, these observations were limited, and a scientific gap remained between the popular buzz and empirical evidence. By systematically investigating this phenomenon, the researchers hoped to gain a clearer picture of the physiological and psychological processes of orgasm, independent of sexual fantasy or direct genital stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of inquiry began with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681994.2011.647902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a foundational study&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. The researchers conducted an anonymous, internet-based survey of 530 women who had experienced either orgasm or sexual pleasure during exercise. The goal was to systematically describe a phenomenon that had, until then, been confined to popular media articles and scattered case reports. This initial study was exploratory, aiming to identify which exercises were most commonly associated with these experiences and what the experiences felt like for the women involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from that first survey established a baseline understanding. Among women who reported exercise-induced orgasms, the most common activities were abdominal exercises, climbing poles or ropes, and lifting weights. A large portion of these women reported feeling self-conscious about their experience, particularly when exercising in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also showed that sexual thoughts or fantasies were rarely associated with these orgasms, suggesting the experience was primarily physiological rather than psychological in origin. For women who experienced sexual pleasure without orgasm, biking or spinning was frequently identified, along with abdominal exercises and weight lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to understand the prevalence of this phenomenon in the general population, the research team conducted &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-01996-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; using data from the 2014 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior. This survey involved a nationally representative probability sample of over 2,000 U.S. adolescents and adults, allowing for a much broader and more generalizable analysis. This study was the first to provide population-level estimates for exercise-induced orgasm and included men in its analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 study revealed that approximately 9% of the survey respondents reported having experienced an orgasm during exercise at least once in their lifetime. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence between men and women. The researchers did find a gender difference in the age of first experience, with women reporting a mean age of about 23, while men reported a mean age of about 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The types of exercises associated with the first experience were consistent with the 2011 findings and included abdominal exercises, climbing, and weight lifting for both genders. The analysis also identified an association between having an exercise-induced orgasm and having an orgasm during sleep, but not with having an orgasm during a recent partnered sexual event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent study, published in 2025, moved from quantitative surveys to qualitative interviews to capture the rich, lived experiences of women. The research team conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 21 women, ranging in age from 19 to 68, who had a history of exercise-induced orgasms. The interviews took place in a setting equipped with exercise mats and a Roman chair, allowing participants to demonstrate, if they felt comfortable, the specific movements that led to their experiences. This method allowed for a detailed exploration of their personal histories, physical sensations, and emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding from these interviews was that the first experience with exercise-induced arousal or orgasm often occurred during childhood or early adolescence. Many women recalled feeling these sensations as young as five or six years old while climbing poles on a playground, doing gymnastics, or performing sit-ups in physical education class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, they were often confused by the sensations, with several participants describing the initial feeling as a sense that they needed to urinate. They lacked a framework for understanding what was happening to their bodies, but they recognized the feeling was pleasurable and, in some cases, sought to reproduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants often described an “aha” moment, which typically occurred later in adolescence or adulthood, when they gained more sexual knowledge from peers, media, or their own sexual experiences. It was at this point they connected their childhood sensations with the concept of arousal and orgasm. One woman recounted how making out with someone for the first time made her realize, “This is the same feeling, how strange.” This moment of recognition helped them make sense of a long-standing, and sometimes bewildering, bodily experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interviews provided detailed descriptions of how an exercise-induced orgasm feels physically. Many women characterized it as a deep, internal sensation, originating in the lower abdomen between the belly button and the pelvis. They often contrasted this with orgasms from direct clitoral stimulation, which they described as more external.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants noted a progression of sensations, starting with a warmth or tingling in their core that would build and radiate downward. The experience was often predictable, with women learning that orgasm would occur after a certain number of repetitions of an exercise, such as after 50 leg lifts or during the third set of pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional responses to these experiences were complex and often evolved over time. Embarrassment and shame were common, especially when the orgasms occurred in public spaces like a gym or during a group fitness class. Participants worried that others might notice their facial expressions or hear them make sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some developed strategies to mask the experience, like keeping a serious facial expression, or to avoid it altogether by choosing different exercises. These feelings were sometimes rooted in cultural or familial taboos around sexuality, which made experiencing an orgasm in a non-sexual, public setting feel inappropriate or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these negative feelings, many women came to accept and even enjoy their ability to have orgasms through exercise. Some viewed it as a motivator to work out, an “added perk at the end of the 100 reps.” Others described it as an empowering experience that gave them a sense of control over their own pleasure, independent of a partner. One woman explained that if she was not getting the attention she needed from her husband, exercise was another way to achieve the stress release of an orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant finding was how some women integrated their knowledge of exercise-induced orgasms into their sexual lives. After learning which muscle contractions produced pleasure during exercise, they were able to apply similar movements during partnered sex. One participant explained that she could tense her core muscles to achieve a stronger or faster orgasm, sometimes allowing her to climax at the same time as her partner. For some, exercise became a form of masturbation or foreplay, and for one woman, it was the only way she had been able to experience orgasm until recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies have some limitations. The initial survey used a convenience sample, which cannot be used to determine prevalence. The new qualitative study involved a small number of participants who were mostly young, white, and living in the United States, so their experiences may not reflect those of a more diverse population. Future research is needed to explore these experiences among men, gender-diverse individuals, people from different cultural backgrounds, and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major direction for future research is to understand the physiological mechanism behind exercise-induced orgasms. It is still not known precisely how muscle contractions during certain exercises trigger an orgasmic response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent studies could involve biomechanical analysis, neuro-imaging, or other physiological measures to investigate the roles of muscle tension, nerve pathways, and the sympathetic nervous system. A better understanding of the mechanism could have practical applications for physical therapists, personal trainers, and even military personnel who must pass rigorous fitness tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681994.2011.647902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exercise-induced orgasm and pleasure among women&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Debby Herbenick and J.

'But while the stress reduced eventually, the weight didn't.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pauline knew her blood pressure was putting her at higher risk of stroke, heart attack and dementia. But it wasn't until decades later, after watching an episode of a healthy-eating series presented by Dr Michael Mosley, The Mail on Sunday columnist who passed away last year, that Pauline found the key to losing the extra pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Seeing him explain his high-protein, low-carb diet made me think that I could follow it,' says Pauline. 'And, alongside more regular exercise, the weight fell off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three years in, Pauline, now 72, has lost 4st 8lb (30kg), does 140 squats a day, and has got her blood pressure in a normal range – all without medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It seems miraculous, but experts speaking to The Mail on Sunday say that anyone can – and should – fix their high blood pressure through simple lifestyle changes like Pauline's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure is the leading cause of heart attack and stroke in the UK – impacting nearly 14 million adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;High blood pressure is the leading cause of heart attack and stroke in the UK – impacting nearly 14 million adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Professor David Webb, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Edinburgh, says losing some weight is an effective way to lower your blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is rising among young people as well – with nearly 170,000 16-24-year-olds estimated to be living undiagnosed. Also known as hypertension, the condition occurs when the pressure of blood pushing against the heart walls is consistently too high, damaging the arteries and restricting blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People of African and Caribbean descent, as well as those with a family history of the condition, are more likely to develop hypertension. But being overweight, smoking, not doing enough exercise and eating a diet high in salt can all also contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, high blood pressure can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But surprisingly, experts say the best way to tackle high blood pressure is not medical treatment but lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last week, The Mail on Sunday's GP columnist Dr Ellie Cannon wrote that high blood pressure is the long-term health condition where she feels patients can make the most difference themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And she asked readers to write in about their own attempts to lower their blood pressure at home – and was flooded with messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 63-year-old man said that eating a daily dose of 85 per cent dark chocolate, as well as more fruit, reduced his blood pressure without him needing to take any medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 56-year-old woman wrote that swapping to decaffeinated coffee brought her blood pressure down to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 72-year-old woman said that buying a mini trampoline was her key to reducing her blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All I need to do is five minutes of exercise in the morning and five in the evening,' she explained. 'This can be either bouncing or jogging on the spot, but it has to be fairly energetic. I make sure I'm slightly out of breath before I finish. I was previously prescribed medication, but now I no longer need to take it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So here are the eight simple steps that experts say are scientifically proven to reverse your high blood pressure without drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;One teaspoon of salt a day... and no more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting out salt from your diet is the single most important thing you can do to lower your blood pressure, says Professor Francesco Cappuccio, a cardiology expert at the University of Warwick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Salt is made up of chloride and sodium – the latter of which we know impacts blood pressure,' he says. 'If you reduce your sodium intake, you reduce your blood pressure significantly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Too much sodium raises blood pressure by causing the body to retain excess water, which increases the blood's volume and puts pressure on artery walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most adults in the UK eat about 8g to 9g of salt a day – but the recommended limit is no more than 6g, or about one teaspoon in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Too much sodium raises blood pressure by causing the body to retain excess water, which increases the blood's volume and puts pressure on artery walls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reducing this amount can lower your blood pressure within just a few weeks, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say the best way to lower intake is to stick to home-cooked food. This is because processed, ready-made foods, such as bread, sauces, soups and ready meals are the main source of added salt in our diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while it's good to limit your intake of processed foods, you don't have to go cold turkey, says Professor David Webb, a clinical pharmacologist at the University of Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can retrain yourself by reducing the amount you add when cooking – though food might taste a little bland at first,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And don't add salt at the table, if you can avoid it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Shedding a few pounds makes a huge difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As was the case for Pauline, losing weight can be another key way to bring down blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being overweight or obese causes hypertension due to excess fat, forcing the heart to pump harder in order to supply blood to the body. That strains the heart and increases resistance in the blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Likewise, says Prof Webb, sleep apnoea – a disorder often triggered by obesity in which breathing stops and starts repeatedly while in bed – can raise blood pressure significantly at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that losing even 5 to 10 per cent of body weight can lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But waist size is key: for men, their waist circumference should measure less than 37in (94cm), while for women, waist size should not exceed 31.5in (80cm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Webb said: 'If you can lose even a little weight, this can help lower blood pressure.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Skip the lift and take the stairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as helping you lose weight, research suggests that regular aerobic exercise – physical activity that increases your heart and breathing rates – can have a direct effect on blood pressure. NHS guidelines advise patients with high blood pressure to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week – which includes anything from brisk walking to trampolining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But one of the most effective ways to get some cardio into your day could just be taking the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS guidelines advise patients with high blood pressure to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week - and taking the stairs can help achieve that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study from researchers in China found that climbing five flights of stairs a day reduced the risk of heart attack, stroke and blood clots by 20 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Climbing up stairs is brilliant for blood pressure,' says Prof Webb. 'The more breathless and sweaty you get, the better.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While aerobic exercise raises your blood pressure in the short term, it has long-term benefits for your heart. 'It controls the heart rate, keeps muscles healthy and is generally a very good thing to do for your health,' says Professor Cappuccio. 'And it's a good preventative strategy to delay the rise in blood pressure that happens naturally with age, even if you don't yet have hypertension.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Daily squats could be the answe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strength training is just as crucial as aerobic exercise in lowering hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could involve lifting weights or using resistance bands, or doing bodyweight exercises such as push-ups or wall-sits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while Pauline likes squats, others may prefer to plank – an abdominal exercise that involves holding a position similar to a push-up without bending the arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As well as helping to tone your glutes, regular squats can lower hypertension and thus lower blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For 80-something Tony Gregory, it was a 30-second plank every morning that brought down his blood pressure. 'I had read about over 100 clinical trials that involved about 100,000 participants that showed doing the plank was especially effective in helping to control blood pressure – and this certainly appears to be working for me!' he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Webb adds: 'It's not exactly clear why any of these exercises are so good for blood pressure, but we think it's likely because they improve cardiac efficiency and reduce resistance in blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They can change the way the heart and blood vessels work.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those looking to lower their blood pressure, Prof Webb advises weight training three times a week (even if only for 10-15 minutes) alongside aerobic exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Eat more bananas and lentils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating more bananas may also help lower blood pressure. The fruit is packed with potassium, a mineral which helps the body balance sodium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other great sources of potassium include kiwi fruit, potatoes, beans, lentils, leafy greens, yogurt, avocado and salmon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We don't eat enough potassium in our diets – particularly as there's hardly any of the nutrient in processed foods,' says Prof Cappuccio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts warn patients to be wary of over-supplementing the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adults aged 19 to 64 only need about 3,500mg of potassium a day – though the American Heart Foundation recommends up to 5,000mg a day for managing high blood pressure. Regularly exceeding this amount can damage the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Swap a glass of orange for... beet juice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A glass of bright red beet juice may seem an odd cure for hypertension. But recent studies show beets – or their juice – can help lower blood pressure due to their high content of inorganic nitrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When consumed, whether eating or drinking it, this nitrate is converted into nitric oxide, a compound shown to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research from scientists at the University of Exeter found that a glass of beetroot juice twice a day significantly lowered blood pressure in adults aged 67 to 79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Beet juice contains nitrates and antioxidants that can lower blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Derek Peel, 75, told us: 'I suffered on and off with high blood pressure until I discovered beetroot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I take a large glass of warm water with a squeeze of lemon juice and a teaspoon of beetroot powder mixed in every morning. Some days I might take a beetroot tablet as well – it really does work and I don't take any medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Webb says: 'There's definitely evidence that beetroot does lower blood pressure, but we need more research into it. It's certainly not an alternative to exercise or cutting down on salt, but might be something to take alongside.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Ditch booze - one pint could put you at risk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol has been proven to raise blood pressure – even in moderate amounts, says Prof Cappuccio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies have shown that the morning after binge drinking, there's an increase in stroke rates as the body's blood pressure is surging,' he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But even regular light to moderate drinking will have a sustained effect in terms of lifetime risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol raises blood pressure, in the short and long-term, by stimulating the nervous system, which raises heart rate and narrows blood vessels. Regularly drinking more than the recommended limits can also cause lasting high blood pressure by limiting the brain's ability to regulate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This sustained high pressure can strain the heart muscle and damage blood vessel walls, increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 study, spanning several decades and including 20,000 people, suggests that blood pressure increases in line with alcohol consumption, starting from as little as one glass of wine per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To limit damage, don't drink more than 14 units – not drinks – of alcohol a week, and spread this over several days, to give the body a chance to recover, NHS guidelines say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Try to get six to eight hours' sleep each night &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep is crucial to health – and blood pressure is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an environmental factor that has been neglected for many years, but lots of studies in recent years have shown the importance of good sleep for blood pressure,' says Prof Cappuccio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The chance of developing high blood pressure is two to three times higher for sleep-deprived people. Whereas if you sleep for longer, research shows that your blood pressure will go down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sleep also has a massive effect on weight gain, which in turn affects blood pressure. We should really all be making an effort to sleep for at least six to eight hours a night.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To do this, he says: 'Make sure your bedroom is a place to sleep – not live. Dim the lights, get rid of any screens, keep it at a cosy temperature and read a nice book.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;I ran back to health in memory of my mum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bradley Pike had never been particularly healthy. But after his mum died from a heart condition in 2023, the dad-of-three began to slip into even worse habits than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started drinking and smoking loads, as a way to deal with the grief,' the 31-year-old, pictured left, says. 'I felt ill all the time and was having dizzy spells a lot.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bradley went to his GP, who ran tests that revealed he was prediabetic and had worryingly high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bradley Pike lowered his blood pressure through running and lost 2.5st in the process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were reluctant to put me on drugs, because I'd need to be on them for life and I was so young,' he explains. 'But they told me I needed to change my lifestyle.' Luckily for Bradley, the route back to health dropped into his lap a few weeks later. He was offered a place in the London Marathon by the British Heart Foundation in memory of his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, training was incredibly difficult, due to his weight and blood pressure. But he stuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In three months, he lost 2.5st (15kg) and brought his blood pressure down to normal levels. He has since run two more marathons and completed a 62-mile (100km) ultramarathon across the Gower Peninsula. 'I look back at my life before and barely recognise myself,' he says. 'There's so much you can do to turn your health around. All you have to do is start.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 14:54:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQb1VTTGFQVFk4MkhBb0IxVEU5LU4zRUpNcXQzWVVEWEZCZFhOYWY2dTZoTE5CM21zZ3hSQnNRMDdiYTREMzhIcVpxckdONGV5b0FtNS0tN3F1VEl2NEdRcWpYYlBkb1VRUDJNMktFbDc3S3NDeDI5U0YyQ0hkVGktNXRKenpQMlRMb3E0WEozLWQ</guid></item><item><title>大量的年轻运动员正在服用肌酸。他们应该吗？ - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/a-huge-number-of-young-athletes-are-taking-creatine-should-they</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/creatine-10045"&gt;Creatine&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most widely used sports supplements across the world. It's taken by many in the hopes of boosting strength, enhancing athletic performance, and promoting muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it isn't only adults who are using this supplement. A growing number of teenagers and young adults report &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a68812063/should-teenagers-take-creatine/"&gt;taking creatine&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of reaping the supplement's benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that as many as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6611041/"&gt;72% of male athletes&lt;/a&gt; aged 17-18 report using creatine. Use is typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1550-2783-5-2"&gt;more common among athletes&lt;/a&gt;, especially young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pomegranates-could-limit-risks-from-controversial-sports-supplement"&gt;Pomegranates Could Limit Risks From Controversial Sports Supplement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While creatine is generally considered to be safe for young people to use, it's no shortcut to getting fit. It's better for young people looking to get strong or improve their athletic performance to focus on the fundamentals: exercising, eating properly, and prioritising sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104568"&gt;natural compound&lt;/a&gt; stored within muscle. Although a small amount is produced in the kidneys and liver, most (around 95%) is obtained from eating meat and seafood. Creatine plays an important role in providing energy during high-intensity activities, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;sprinting and lifting weights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179717" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179717" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642.jpg" alt="man with dumbells" class="wp-image-179717 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179717" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Creatine provides extra energy to muscles for high-intensity activities. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC9JJETQoI/"&gt;DorianGray/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several forms of creatine are commercially available, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17172748"&gt;creatine monohydrate&lt;/a&gt; is the most stable and extensively studied form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies show that creatine supplementation enhances performance in high-intensity exercises requiring strength and power, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17172748"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; and sprinting. Creatine supplementation may also lead to more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15092116"&gt;muscle growth&lt;/a&gt; when combined with resistance training, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061915"&gt;faster recovery&lt;/a&gt; from exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research also suggests that creatine's benefits extend beyond the gym. Studies indicate that creatine may improve aspects of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; – specifically memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2015.12.034"&gt;shows promise&lt;/a&gt; for older adults in preventing muscle loss and protecting against neurological disorders such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creatine's safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical diet that includes meat and seafood provides around &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104568"&gt;1–2 grams of creatine&lt;/a&gt; per day, which keeps the muscles around 60–80% full of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a daily creatine supplement eventually fills the muscles with creatine. There are two common ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quickest and most commonly studied method involves a one-week loading phase. This entails taking 0.3 grams of creatine per kilogram of body weight four times a day. For example, a 75kg person would take a total of 24g of creatine per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z/"&gt;alternative approach&lt;/a&gt;, which increases muscle creatine levels more gradually, is to take 3g of creatine per day for around 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both approaches will fill muscle creatine stores. The first (loading) approach tops up creatine stores faster, which means you'll see benefits to exercise performance faster. However, the second approach is less likely to cause temporary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;gastrointestinal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; (such as bloating and diarrhoea) which are more common when using the loading approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what approach you use, taking 3- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5g" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73071" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt; of creatine daily is necessary to maintain muscle creatine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;Numerous studies show&lt;/a&gt; that short and long-term creatine supplementation (up to 30g a day for five years) is safe and has no ill effects on health when taken at the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;recommended dosages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effect of creatine is weight gain as the supplement &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00157.2007"&gt;increases water retention&lt;/a&gt; in muscles. This extra water remains only as long as you're taking creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creatine and young people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although creatine is shown to be safe and effective for adults, only a few studies have investigated the effects among children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available studies show that creatine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2018.00115"&gt;appears to be safe&lt;/a&gt; for young people to use and can provide &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020664"&gt;performance benefits&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for athletes. Most studies have only looked at the safety of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0162-2"&gt;creatine dosage&lt;/a&gt; between 0.1g and 0.3g per kg of body mass per day. As such, it's important that any young people who choose to use creatine do not exceed this dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although creatine appears to be safe for children and adolescents to take, it is possible that, without proper nutrition education and supervision of dosing, they could be at risk of misusing creatine – potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt; such as stomach cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179721" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642.jpg" alt="man with stomach cramps" class="wp-image-179721 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179721" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stomach cramps can be an adverse effect of misusing creatine. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEpfy0r27A/"&gt;SHOTPRIME/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study that evaluated young athletes' understanding of how sports supplements &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-019-0294-7"&gt;should be used&lt;/a&gt; reported that only 11% of the athletes answered questions correctly about creatine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of age, it's important to recognise that supplements such as creatine are not a shortcut to improving fitness, building muscle, or losing body fat. Supplements provide much &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2025.1663860"&gt;smaller performance gains&lt;/a&gt; compared to what can be achieved through good training and nutrition alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sports supplements support training and recovery, significant progress comes from consistent exercise, a balanced diet, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00564"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a well-designed training programme and healthy eating plan, young people will experience rapid improvements in strength, power, and endurance without the need for supplements. Focusing too soon on taking supplements could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/her/18.1.98"&gt;distract young people&lt;/a&gt; from building good training habits and healthy eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why most sport nutritionists recommend using a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2021-0335"&gt;food-first approach&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on maximising diet quality before recommending supplements such as creatine.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267365/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/paul-hough-2282013"&gt;Paul Hough&lt;/a&gt;, Lecturer Sport &amp;amp; Exercise Physiology , &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-westminster-916"&gt;University of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

The link traces back to food handling practices in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to determine whether some UTIs occur due to factors other than hygiene or dehydration, as the bacteria that cause them are commonly associated with the gut and enter the urethra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research found that 18 per cent of UTIs were linked to E. coli strains that originated from animals used for meat production. 1 in 5 UTI-causing bacteria was identified on the basis of genetics as the bacteria found in meat. This means that some cases of UTI can also come from meat, not just the body's bacteria. The highest contamination levels, around 36 to 38 per cent, were found in meats like chicken and turkey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the study found that people residing in low-income areas had a 60 per cent higher chance of contracting a UTI from food-borne bacteria. The reasons suggest inadequate access to refrigeration, poor kitchen sanitation, or improper cooking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does it mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/02/original/chopping_1762089259420.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="If you are using a common chopping board to cut raw meat, make sure you wash it well before using it again.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;This means how you cook and handle the meat is very critical and should not be taken lightly. Here, the kitchen proved to be an unexpected source, as it's where all food handling takes place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If raw meat carrying E. coli is not handled safely and correct hygiene is not maintained, there is a chance of the bacteria spreading. For example, not washing food properly or failing to clean the cutting board and chopping vegetables on it. The bacteria then get transferred to other foods, significantly increasing the risk of contamination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your food handling practices, along with personal hygiene practices, are just as vital in preventing UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

As the evenings close in and the mornings grow murky, energy ebbs and a heavy sadness settles in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although seasonal affective disorder (Sad) was only formally recognised by psychiatrists in the 1980s, the link between the seasons, mood and vitality has long been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine – a Chinese text from roughly 300BC – described how the seasons affect all living things. It advised that in winter, one should “retire early and get up with the sunrise”, keeping “desires and mental activity quiet and subdued, as if keeping a happy secret”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Today, scientists are rediscovering how closely tuned our biology is to the seasons. According to Dr Cathy Wyse, a chancellor’s research fellow at the University of Edinburgh, the biggest advance over the past decade “has been the realisation that seasonal changes in human mood are probably endogenous – that they’re part of our physiology”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Large-scale resources such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/18/uk-biobank-is-safely-sharing-health-data-to-drive-medical-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; have transformed this area of research, allowing scientists to track seasonal patterns across hundreds of thousands of people over many years – something that was previously impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, where to draw the line between normal winter sluggishness and clinical depression is not straightforward. Sad is recognised as a subtype of major depression or bipolar disorder, defined by its predictable seasonal pattern: symptoms typically begin in autumn or winter and lift in spring. Alongside typical signs of depression, people often sleep longer, feel lethargic and want to eat more, particularly carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The triggers of these changes are still being investigated, but they are almost certainly linked to reduced daylight. Light is the key regulator of our internal body or circadian clock, influencing the timing of hormone release, alertness and mood. Without sufficient daylight – especially when combined with too much artificial light in the evenings – these rhythms can drift out of sync with the external world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4bd39955-f577-4324-88ab-06658bf4a4f5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Amish people in the US, who spend more time outdoors and less time exposed to artificial light at night, have some of the lowest Sad rates among Caucasian populations.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some people may be more sensitive to this shift than others. Wyse and her colleagues are studying seasonal effects in &lt;a href="https://www.heliosbd.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, where manic episodes often peak in spring and depression tends to be more common in the darker months. “We suspect that people with bipolar disorder may be very sensitive to light and seasonal cues, and that’s triggering their symptoms,” said Wyse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even among those without clinical depression, many people experience a milder seasonal dip in mood, known as subsyndromal Sad or “the winter blues”. In the UK, an estimated one in five people are affected, though only about 2% experience full Sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet, seasonal biology extends far beyond mood. Researchers have found fluctuations in the expression of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8000" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than 4,000 protein-coding genes&lt;/a&gt; in white blood cells and fat, along with changes in the cellular composition of blood itself across the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wyse and her colleagues recently analysed four years of UK Biobank sleep data from half a million people. “We found that in winter, people tended to sleep longer and had increased sleeplessness – their sleep wasn’t so good as in the summer,” said Wyse, who will present these findings at the British Sleep Society conference in Brighton next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However natural these seasonal changes may be, society still expects people to carry on as normal. Few of us can hibernate, however tempting that may sound. The most effective antidote to the winter slump is light. Bright light therapy remains the gold standard for treating Sad, though timing and dosage are critical (see below). For those unable to manage a daily session in front of a light box, natural sunlight is a powerful substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="aae49198-892e-44fa-813c-7151b7917e50" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Early morning light is especially powerful in resetting the circadian clock.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Rebecca Cole/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies of Amish communities in the US – who spend more time outdoors and less time exposed to bright artificial light at night – show some of the lowest Sad rates recorded among Caucasian populations. By contrast, the prevalence in New York is about 4.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Exposure to bright, natural light early in the day helps to synchronise the circadian clock and suppress lingering melatonin, a night-time hormone that may make a person feel groggy. Light also has a direct alerting effect: one study found that an hour of blue-enriched light boosted reaction times more than the equivalent of two cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But light isn’t the whole story. Cognitive behavioural therapy tailored for Sad can be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25859764/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;as effective as light therapy&lt;/a&gt;, helping people reframe their relationship with winter rather than just manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Winter will come regardless. By shifting how we think about it, we can reclaim some joy from the darker months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-beat-the-winter-blues" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;How to beat the winter blues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;footer class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek the morning sun: &lt;/strong&gt;Even on grey days, step outside as early as possible. Daylight resets your circadian clock, improves alertness and suppresses melatonin. Early morning light is especially powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a light box: &lt;/strong&gt;Brightness levels are measured in lux. A typical Sad lamp will emit light at about 10,000 lux – 20 to 40 times brighter than typical office lighting, and roughly equivalent to outdoor light on an overcast summer’s day. Sit in front of it for 20–30 minutes soon after waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your sleep habits: &lt;/strong&gt;Stick to regular sleep and wake times, avoid screens late at night and keep evening lighting warm and dim. This helps prevent your internal rhythms from drifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get outside – properly:&lt;/strong&gt; Even on a cloudy day in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;January, outdoor light is roughly 10 times brighter than indoors. Aim for at least an hour a day, ideally combining it with something enjoyable: a walk, a coffee in the park or a kick-about with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan winter pleasures: &lt;/strong&gt;Reframe thoughts such as “I hate winter” into “winter is harder, but I can plan around it”. Embrace cosy rituals, such as candles, hot chocolate or warm baths and schedule social or outdoor activities, such as cold-water dips or winter hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when to seek help: &lt;/strong&gt;If mood, sleep or motivation problems persist for weeks or interfere with daily life, speak to a GP or mental health professional. Sad is treatable.&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast, the more limited cognitive challenges found in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who do not have learning difficulties may be consequences of their inattention and hyperactivity. The research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251376776" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ADHD and those with specific learning difficulties often exhibit overlapping challenges with attention and certain thinking skills. This has led researchers to question the nature of this relationship: Are the difficulties with memory and processing simply a side effect of being inattentive or hyperactive? A team of researchers sought to disentangle these factors to better understand the underlying cognitive profiles of these distinct but frequently co-occurring conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there have been previous studies that examined the link between ADHD symptoms and learning or cognitive skills in groups of children with ADHD or learning difficulties, there has been no study that examined how ADHD symptoms influence cognitive skills that are key to learning in these neurodivergent groups,” said study author Yufei Cai, a PhD researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how ADHD attentional behaviors influence these cognitive skills that are essential for successful learning in these neurodivergent populations can offer suggestions for designing interventions that might improve cognitive or learning functioning in these neurodivergent groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers performed a detailed analysis of existing data from the Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory, a large cohort of children referred for concerns related to attention, memory, or learning. They selected data from 770 children, aged 5 to 18, and organized them into four distinct groups. These groups included children with a diagnosis of ADHD only, children with learning difficulties only, children with both ADHD and learning difficulties, and a comparison group of children with no known neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each child had completed a broad range of standardized tests. These assessments measured fundamental cognitive skills such as verbal and visuospatial short-term memory, working memory (the ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily), processing speed, and sustained attention. Higher-level executive functions, like the ability to flexibly shift between different tasks or rules, were also evaluated. Alongside these direct assessments, parents provided ratings of their child’s daily behaviors related to inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is the first to date that has (1) a relatively large neurodivergent sample size, (2) a comprehensive battery of cognitive and learning measures, and (3) the inclusion of a co-occurring condition group of those with both ADHD and learning difficulties to examine the extent to which elevated scores of ADHD symptoms can account for the group differences in cognitive skills that are key to learning between these neurodivergent and comparison groups,” Cai told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study aims to characterize the cognitive profiles of these three neurodivergent groups, as well as examine the associations between ADHD symptoms (i.e., inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors) and cognitive skills that are key to learning in children with ADHD, learning difficulties, and those with both conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the analysis involved a two-step comparison. First, the researchers compared the performance of the four groups across all the cognitive tests to identify where differences existed. Next, they applied a statistical approach to see what would happen to these differences if they mathematically adjusted for each child’s level of parent-rated inattention and hyperactivity. If a group’s cognitive weakness disappeared after this adjustment, it would suggest the cognitive issue might be a consequence of attentional behaviors. If the weakness remained, it would point to a more fundamental cognitive deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a clear divergence between the groups. Children with learning difficulties, both with and without a co-occurring ADHD diagnosis, displayed a broad pattern of lower performance across many cognitive domains. They showed weaknesses in short-term memory, working memory, processing speed, sustained attention, and the ability to sequence information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers statistically accounted for levels of inattention and hyperactivity, these cognitive deficits largely persisted. This outcome suggests that for children with learning difficulties, these cognitive challenges are likely foundational to their condition, not just a byproduct of attentional issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profile for children with ADHD only was quite different. This group performed at age-appropriate levels on many of the cognitive tasks, including verbal short-term memory, working memory, processing speed, and sustained attention. They did show some specific difficulties, particularly in visuospatial short-term memory and the ability to quickly sequence numbers or letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these particular challenges were no longer apparent after the statistical analysis adjusted for their levels of inattention and hyperactivity. This finding indicates that for these children, their attentional behaviors may directly interfere with performance on certain cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One specific challenge did appear to be independent of attentional behaviors for the ADHD only group. Their difficulty with set shifting, or mentally switching between different task rules, remained even after accounting for inattention and hyperactivity. This points to a more specific executive function challenge in ADHD that may not be fully explained by its primary behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings paint a picture of two different neurodevelopmental pathways. For children with learning difficulties, core cognitive weaknesses appear to drive their academic struggles. For many children with ADHD alone, their primary attentional challenges may be what creates more limited and specific hurdles in their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Children with learning difficulties, either with or without ADHD, had lower levels of cognitive skills than children with ADHD without co-occurring learning difficulties and those in the comparison group,” Cai explained. “Elevated levels of inattention and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors did not influence the low cognitive performance observed in these children. Instead, this lower cognitive performance may be more closely associated with their learning ability, which is central to their neurodevelopmental characteristics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, these attentional behaviors are closely linked to the more limited cognitive challenges observed in children with ADHD without co-occurring learning difficulties. Understanding whether neurodivergent children with ADHD, learning difficulties, or both experience cognitive or learning-related challenges provides a valuable framework for designing targeted intervention and support strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, the study includes some limitations. The group with learning difficulties was identified based on low scores on academic tests rather than formal clinical diagnoses of conditions like dyslexia or dyscalculia, which might not be perfectly equivalent. The study’s design provides a snapshot at a single point in time, so it cannot capture how these relationships might evolve as children develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by following children over several years to observe these developmental trajectories directly. Incorporating a wider array of cognitive measures and gathering behavioral information from multiple sources, including teachers, could also help create an even more detailed understanding. Such work could help refine support strategies, ensuring that interventions are targeted to a child’s specific profile of cognitive and behavioral needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251376776" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Associations Between ADHD Symptom Dimensions and Cognition in Children With ADHD and Learning Difficulties&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yufei Cai, Joni Holmes, and Susan E.

&lt;p&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days. But if you’re reaching for a bottle of multivitamins right to supplement the gaps, you may want to slow your roll, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietician nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.mpmnutrition.com/about" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7965912" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Marissa Karp&lt;/a&gt; had this advice: “While supplements can help us bridge the gap and serve as an insurance policy, they aren’t a replacement for eating nourishing foods. If you aren’t already eating well, moving your body, drinking water and managing your stress, don’t waste money on supplements. Taking supplements and then eating processed foods is not the same as eating a whole foods diet and using supplements to help ensure you’re getting enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She offered this example of the joy of whole foods: “When you eat an avocado, it’s not just about the potassium or dietary fiber, but the synergy of the nutrients working together. It’s how the fat and fiber in the avocado slow down your gastric emptying and help keep you fuller longer. It’s also about how satisfying it tastes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying well-nourished is much simpler than you might think, Walker said. “We don’t need extreme diets or supplements to fill these nutrient gaps, but simple, intentional dietary shifts that can make a significant impact. By increasing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy and lean proteins, you can improve your intake of these critical shortfall nutrients, leading to better long-term health and disease prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shortfall-nutrients_l_67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7965912"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It became the first fully synthetic molecule to be considered a drug after scientists discovered it could be used to treat some diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most famously, the German immunologist Paul Ehrlich experimented with methylene blue and found that it could treat malaria in sailors. Ehrlich coined the concept of the “magic bullet” — the idea that if you could find a chemical that binds to a certain bacteria or virus but not the rest of the tissue, it could help target diseases. He went on to do notable work in syphilis and chemotherapy, and his career was documented and dramatized in the 1940 film, “Dr. Ehrlich’s Magic Bullet,” starring Edward G. Robinson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is absolutely the history of methylene blue,” said Gordon Lithgow of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, who studies molecules that extend lifespan. “That (magic bullet) principle still drives pharmacology culture today. We’re looking for specific agents that bind to one thing and don’t affect other stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, methylene blue has been used as a staining compound in labs because it helps visualize the presence of certain materials in cells and track their rate of movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, methylene blue is FDA-approved to treat just one medical condition, methemoglobinemia, a rare disorder that affects how red blood cells function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the hype began&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did it go from a dye and staining compound to a buzzed-about anti-aging supplement? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear, but a few things have happened recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Nir Barzilai, a well-known longevity researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine who studies centenarians, &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/news/2024/03/11/evaluating-possible-anti-aging-drugs" data-link="native" class=""&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/5138/99193547794" data-link="native" class=""&gt;ranking&lt;/a&gt; of 12 FDA-approved drugs that he and his research team consider worth studying for anti-aging potential, based on pre-clinical and clinical studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top four drugs are SLGT2 inhibitors (a Type 2 diabetes drug), metformin (also a diabetes drug), biphosphonates (which treat osteoporosis and some cancers) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (which treat diabetes and obesity, and include Ozempic). Lower down on the list is methylene blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Mel Gibson did an interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast during which he said methylene blue and the antiparasitic ivermectin helped cure three of his friends’ cancer — remarks that were countered by medical experts for lack of scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, a video of RFK Jr., putting blue drops into a glass of water went viral on X. Many speculated it was methylene blue, though that was not confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Bryan Johnson, a biohacker who injected plasma from his son as part of an anti-aging regimen, tweeted that &lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1896679614602482042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1896679614602482042%7Ctwgr%5E05afb6eaa33ba75e55b3e1d1a2737cf026231733%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Flifestyle%2Fbryan-johnson-mel-gibson-possibly-200842038.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;he was starting methylene blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, there’s been a surge of social media chatter about methylene blue, with many people posting Instagram and TikTok videos of their blue tongues — methylene blue can temporarily turn your tongue and urine blue — and saying it helps with mood, focus, energy and cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The mitochondria connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason methylene blue is being explored as a potential anti-aging compound is because of its connection to mitochondrial function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are part of the cell that produces energy. Loss of mitochondrial function, due to oxidative stress increasing over time, is a hallmark of aging, said Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics at Stanford who researches longevity. Methylene blue has antioxidant properties that can help lower oxidative stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with mitochondrial dysfunction get a lot of fatigue, he said, and loss of mitochondrial function has been observed in many diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8699482/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of studies on the anti-aging potential of methylene blue found that low doses of the compound improved oxidative stress, cognitive defects and memory in mice.

Metformin, for instance, has been widely prescribed for diabetes for decades, but researchers more recently found that it also has antioxidant properties, which could make it useful as a longevity drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been widely used and we know a lot about it and the side effects,” Snyder said of metformin. “I don’t know that you can say the same for methylene blue just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithgow, of the Buck Institute, cautioned people to “be really careful, especially when using synthetic molecules to affect something in your body without appropriate supervision.

The study authors shared, “Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important.” If you have been on multiple drugs for long-term, consider your gut as a part of your care plan. It is not just about taking pills, it is about living well while taking them.

&lt;p&gt;Older people who listen to music often slash their risk of dementia by more than a third, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied people over the age of 70 and found that listening to music—or playing an instrument—is linked to a reduction of up to 39% in the chances of developing the debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increases in life expectancy due to advances in medicine and technology have seen a rise in the prevalence of age‐related diseases, including dementia and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, involving more than 10,800 older people, looked at the benefits of listening to or playing music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that always listening to music—compared with never, rarely, or sometimes doing so—was associated with a 39% decreased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing an instrument was associated with a 35% reduction in dementia risk, according to&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.70163" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; the study published&lt;/a&gt; in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always listening to music was also associated with a 17% lower incidence of cognitive impairment, as well as higher scores in overall cognition and ‘episodic memory’, which is used when recalling everyday events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regularly engaging in both listening to and playing music was associated with a 33% decreased risk of dementia and 22% decreased risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Evidence suggests that brain aging is not just based on age and genetics but can be influenced by one’s own environmental and lifestyle choices,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102855" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said the study’s senior author&lt;/a&gt; Professor Joanne Ryan of Monash University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With no cure currently available for dementia, the importance of identifying strategies to help prevent or delay onset of the disease is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that lifestyle-based interventions, such as listening and/or playing music can promote cognitive health,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are promising, though “causation cannot be established,” suggested study co-author Emma Jaffa.&lt;/p&gt;

The asparagus plant produces &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003194221300352X?via=ihub" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;a compound called the asparagusic acid&lt;/a&gt; and, when it's digested by your body, it releases sulphur compounds too. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/533914" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;It's these chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, such as methanethiol and dimethyl sulphide, that make your sweat and your pee smell a certain way. Sulphur compounds are very volatile, so they easily disperse in the air. That's why they're so easy to smell from the toilet bowl. This smell usually lasts &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12264" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;more than five hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Not everybody produces this smell, although studies about this &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140818-mystery-of-asparagus-and-urine" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;keep &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140818-mystery-of-asparagus-and-urine" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;coming up with different findings&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1950s, research seemed to suggest that fewer than 50% of people produce the tell-tale asparagus pee odour, while in 2010, researchers found more than 90% of test participants did. So it’s not clear cut. And not everybody can perceive the stink: the ability to smell one's pungent &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/36/1/9/442551?login=false" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;asparagus-smelling pee seems to be down to genetics&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, when it comes to fruit and vegetables more widely, eating more of them can lead to a more attractive scent. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513816301933" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;A 2017 study in Australia&lt;/a&gt; found that men who had consumed more fruit and vegetables were significantly associated with smelling better – more fruity, floral and sweet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study also notes, interestingly, when people have to rate people's faces, slightly yellower skin rich in carotenoid – a molecule from carrots, pumpkins, tomatoes and papayas and others – is also found to be more attractive. But the same study suggests that people consuming diets with a little bit of fat, meat, egg, and tofu intake were also associated with more pleasant-smelling sweat. Carb-heavy diets produced the least sexy of scents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="meat-and-fish" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="meat-and-fish" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Meat and fish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meat and fish can also produce a distinct body odour as animal proteins are broken down by the body into amino acids and fats, which are then excreted through sweat – where they interact with skin bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNakprX2xSVmdrUVR3Z21GWnRiRnFhS2Q0YW90Q3IzVW03NUk1U3lfQkdFanVSNG5mZTA4SHRLVDlHcm1RMkNVcXhDcEJBbHJsYm9lZi1BRDF6Mk93TDJza0cwU20ycGtmVWQtQnZxYnpBVUdlbFlmZkpXanpBcDRjYTkwa0lDekhYcFZYUHRzazcxSXc</guid></item><item><title>以下是您应该（或不应该）在全身冰浴中浸泡的原因-有线</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/is-cold-plunging-good-for-you/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Cold plunging at&lt;/span&gt; the gym or having a chilly shower at home has become a popular practice in recent years.

If you don’t have a gym membership and don’t fancy stripping down to your bathing suit at the local lake, an indoor bathtub filled with icy cold water will do. “You don’t need an expensive set up,” says Brecka. “A bathtub with ice works. A horse trough in the backyard works. Dedicated plunge pools are convenient, but you’ll get benefits no matter how you create cold exposure. It’s consistency that matters more than equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;So how long do you cold plunge and what temperature should a cold plunge be? Brecka suggests two to six minutes as the ideal time. It’s long enough to activate the nervous system and short enough to stay safe. If you’re new to cold plunging, however, under a minute is plenty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="is-cold-plunge-good-for-you" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Is Cold Plunging Good for You?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“What are the benefits of cold plunging?” is the million dollar question you’re probably asking yourself, right as you're staring into the tub (along with “Why don’t you just have a warm cookie and hot chocolate instead?” which is what I often hear my inner child say.) Brecka suggests persevering for maximum benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We do a plunge because cold exposure activates your nervous system, improves circulation, and helps your body adapt to stress,” he says. “Cold plunging is not about powering through the shock, it’s about letting that shock drive physiological change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Some studies show benefits for cold plunging, including from &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/research-highlights-health-benefits-from-cold-water-immersions?" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;.

In 2022 alone, around 2.3 million women were diagnosed with the disease, and approximately 670,000 died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO has also projected that, if current trends continue, both incidence and mortality will rise by about 40% by 2050 in many regions, including those with limited health infrastructure. Furthermore, disparities in survival are stark: in high-income countries, 5-year survival often exceeds 90%, but in India it is estimated at 66%, and in parts of sub-Saharan Africa it drops to 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Breast Cancer: Early signs of the disease one must never ignore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, breast cancer is caused by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors that lead to the uncontrolled growth of breast cells. The key causes and risk factors include inherited genetic mutations like those in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, prolonged exposure to hormones like estrogen, aging, lifestyle choices such as obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking, and radiation exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major study has now sounded a warning for millions of women worldwide: a commonly used daily medication is now confirmed to be linked with an increased risk of breast cancer. According to new research published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2840506" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;JAMA Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, certain hormonal contraceptives — especially those that are progestin-only or use specific synthetic progestins — carry a measurable increase in breast cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the medication has long been considered safe for most women, the fresh evidence suggests a need for informed discussions between patients and doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large population-based cohort study in Sweden, involving more than 2 million women aged 13 to 49 and tracking over 21 million person-years, found that use of hormonal contraceptives was associated with a higher incidence of breast cancer. The study reports that the hazard ratio (HR) for ever-use of any hormonal contraceptive was about 1.24 (i.e., a 24% relative increase compared to never-users).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study reveal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per the key findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have ever used hormonal contraceptives had an increased breast cancer risk (HR 1.24; 95% CI 1.20-1.28) compared with never-users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk varied by formulation: for progestin-only pills, the HR was approximately 1.21 (95% CI 1.17-1.25), while for combined estrogen-progestin pills it was about 1.12 (95% CI 1.07-1.17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among specific progestin types, the synthetic progestin called Desogestrel (used alone or in combination) showed higher HRs (e.g., oral desogestrel-only HR ≈ 1.18; desogestrel-combined HR ≈ 1.19) than levonorgestrel-based formulations (HR ≈ 1.09 for combined oral levonorgestrel).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excess absolute risk was modest in individual terms: roughly 13 additional breast-cancer cases per 100,000 person-years of users of any hormonal contraceptive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why these findings matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, hormonal contraceptives are widely used globally — for pregnancy prevention, menstrual regulation, acne treatment, endometriosis management, and other reasons. Now, the aforementioned study points to a nuanced risk profile — while the relative increases are not huge, because so many women use these medications, the population impact is non-trivial. Moreover, the finding that one formulation (desogestrel) may carry a higher risk is new and requires consideration when prescribing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limitations and important context&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the data provides a crucial insight for women’s overall health, it’s important to remember that the study is observational. It cannot prove causation — only suggests association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased risk must be considered alongside the well-documented benefits of hormonal contraceptives — including protection against unintended pregnancy and reduced risks of ovarian and endometrial cancer. Additionally, the absolute risk for an individual woman remains small. Most women using these medications will not develop breast cancer due solely to their contraceptive use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the study reveals that the duration of use and timing matter: i.e., longer use was associated with a higher risk (for example, 5-10 years of use HR ≈ 1.34) in the Swedish study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What women and healthcare providers should consider&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Individual risk assessment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women should discuss contraceptive options with their healthcare provider, especially if they have other breast cancer risk factors (family history, genetic predisposition, prior breast conditions, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Formulation and follow-up matters:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study suggests that progestin-only pills and desogestrel-based products may carry a higher risk than some other formulations. The prescription should be made keeping that in mind. Moreover, one should monitor the duration of use, transitions between formulations, and periodic reevaluation of risk-benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Balance benefits and risks:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contraceptives provide many benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. The new findings do not mean all use should stop, but they highlight the need and importance of informed choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Regular screening and vigilance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women using hormonal contraceptives should continue routine breast-health screening, self-exams, and lifestyle risk-reducing behaviors (maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol, avoiding smoking, exercising).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家在美国最原始的地方之一取得了令人惊叹的发现： “意义重大” -雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/scientists-stunning-discovery-one-most-090000402.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the smallest wildlife play extremely &lt;a href="https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/radicalbugs/index.php?page=importance_of_insects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:outsized roles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;outsized roles&lt;/a&gt; in their ecosystems and globally, and now they're at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.70187" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that insect numbers are declining rapidly, even in remote ecosystems with little human contact.

This shows that even remote, relatively pristine environments are not immune to the effects of human activity, such as planet-heating pollution on fish migration and microplastics in the Himalayas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why are insect populations important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Insects are among the most essential and overlooked organisms on Earth.

  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;New paper published today commits UK to major reform in rare therapies  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bold new rulebook for rare therapies is being written, for publication next year &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;≈3.5 million people in UK affected by rare disease but only 5% of rare diseases have approved treatment  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;MHRA reforms will speed up path for rare therapies from discovery to delivery &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rulebook for rare disease therapies will be overhauled to make it quicker and easier to get these therapies tested, manufactured and approved in the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has announced in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rare-therapies-and-uk-regulatory-considerations"&gt;new paper published today&lt;/a&gt; supporting the ambitions of the Government’s life sciences strategy.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central to this reform will be tackling the unique barriers that currently prevent life-changing rare disease therapies from reaching patients, like small patient numbers and difficult evidence generation, while maintaining safety.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around 3.5 million people in the UK – one in 17 – live with a rare disease, equivalent to one child in every classroom. When carers are included, this community is larger than the population of London.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet fewer than 5% of rare diseases currently have an approved treatment. The average diagnostic journey takes 5.6 years, and 30% of affected children die before the age of five. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of delayed diagnosis and limited treatment options is estimated at £340 million annually, with a further £4.7 billion in health-related disability costs and a £14.9 billion annual loss to the economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper published today sets out how the MHRA is thinking to change this. It commits the UK to major reform and is a huge signal that significant change for rare disease patients is on its way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supporting the development of the reforms is a newly formed &lt;a href="#eel-decline"&gt;Rare Disease Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, which includes patients and their representatives, academics and industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="julian-beach-mhra-executive-director-healthcare-quality-and-access-said"&gt; Julian Beach, MHRA Executive Director, Healthcare Quality and Access, said:   &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK has the ingredients to be a global leader in rare disease therapies, with a rich academic base, a single provider of genomics and the unique, diverse datasets of the NHS. The challenge is bringing all these elements together, which our new framework will do. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There is still more work to be done, but I hope this paper reassures all those affected by rare disease that we are listening and are prepared to take bold action to speed the path from discovery to delivery, while maintaining strict standards of safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="last-child"&gt;I would like to say a massive thank you to all those who have helped us get here today. This could not have been done without the collaboration from all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more challenging to develop a therapy for a rare disease than for a more common disease like diabetes or hypertension. With small, scattered patient groups and limited scientific understanding of the condition, recruiting participants and conducting clinical trials can be difficult and expensive, making it much harder to gather the evidence needed to prove that a treatment works. This also reduces the financial incentive for companies to invest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in science and technology are now enabling highly individualised treatments, even for relatively common rare diseases that affect several thousand people in the UK. Gene-based therapies such as CRISPR or mRNA can be tailored to target specific patient subgroups. In the case of CRISPR, a treatment may even be designed for a single individual based on their unique genetic profile, despite many others sharing the same condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, each new rare therapy requires a separate route through regulatory approval, including an approval to get the clinical trial set up and then an approval to be marketed in the UK (known as a marketing authorisation or licence). This approach is costly and inefficient, making it unviable to develop multiple highly targeted treatments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the framework won’t be published in full until next year, the paper today outlines some bold ideas, including whether an early, single approval could be issued for both a clinical trial application and marketing authorisation based on compelling but limited evidence. This approval would be granted with a strict safety monitoring plan with real-world evidence review at a set frequency.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper also sets out:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;how to better share evidence in the UK and globally to pool scarce data   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Whether a single approval could be issued for a therapy, even where there is a variable component tailored to an individual’s characteristics  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;the importance of strengthened post-market surveillance   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;better health system alignment in the UK and internationally     &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work supports the Government’s &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/england-rare-diseases-action-plan-2025"&gt;Rare Disease Action Plan,&lt;/a&gt; as well as the long-term plans for the NHS and life sciences sector.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id="nick-meade-chief-executive-of-genetic-alliance-uk-said"&gt;Nick Meade, Chief Executive of Genetic Alliance UK, said:  &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For too many families, a rare diagnosis comes without a viable cure or treatment. This programme is a vital step towards changing that. Fostering the development of treatments here in the UK will bring direct benefits for people living with rare conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="last-child"&gt;We welcome this clear signal of the UK’s commitment to becoming a world leader in rare condition therapy development, and our community of rare condition organisations stands ready to lend its expertise to make it a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="dr-rick-thompson-ceo-of-beacon-for-rare-diseases-said"&gt;Dr Rick Thompson, CEO of Beacon: for rare diseases, said:  &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It has long been clear to our community of rare disease patient groups and charities that the UK has all of the ingredients to become a true leader in rare disease science and care provision; however, too often patients have been left feeling isolated and unseen by the health system.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="last-child"&gt;This paper from the MHRA provides hope that a real shift in the UKs approach to caring for the millions affected by rare diseases is possible. The creation of regulatory pathways tailored to the unique challenges posed by rare diseases, and a pragmatic approach to collection of data in the real world is something we have hoped to see for many years. Beacon is excited to see what develops in the coming year, and committed to supporting the rare disease patient community to engage with this important work however possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="dr-jacqeline-barry-chief-clinical-officer-cell-and-gene-therapy-catapult-said"&gt;Dr Jacqeline Barry, Chief Clinical Officer, Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, said: &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Advancing regulatory approaches for rare diseases is essential to ensure that patients with the greatest unmet need can access innovative treatments without unnecessary delay.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Through this initiative, the MHRA aims to create flexible, science-led regulatory pathways that speed up clinical trials and product approvals for rare disease therapies, while upholding the highest standards of safety, efficacy, and quality.   &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="last-child"&gt;These efforts have the potential not only to transform patients’ lives, but also to reduce the long-term burden on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="sam-barrell-ceo-of-lifearc-said-"&gt;Sam Barrell, CEO of LifeArc, said:   &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For people living with rare diseases, every moment counts – they need action now. This is the message I hear time and again when speaking with families.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="last-child"&gt;That’s why we welcome today’s announcement, which aims to tackle some of the key challenges holding back new treatments reaching people who need them. If we seize this opportunity and position the UK as a hub for innovative research in rare diseases, the breakthroughs we achieve could also revolutionise care for more common conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id="dr-harriet-holme-founder-and-executive-chair-of-pcd-research"&gt;Dr Harriet Holme, Founder and Executive Chair of PCD Research: &lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Rare diseases place a profound toll on patients and their families, bringing years of uncertainty, financial strain, and lost opportunities for children and adults alike. The figures are stark, the cost of inaction is estimated at £33 billion every year, but behind this are families navigating uncertainty and patients waiting too long for hope. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Significant advances in genomics, AI, and genetic treatments such as mRNA and CRISPR now offer unprecedented potential to transform outcomes for patients. The successful treatment of Baby KJ with the first on-demand CRISPR therapy shows what is possible, but barriers remain to delivering this type of transformational treatment at pace and scale. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;That’s why today’s MHRA announcement is so important. By committing to change the UK’s regulatory framework for rare disease therapies, the MHRA is laying the foundation for crucial steps towards ensuring that innovation can safely reach patients faster. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="last-child"&gt;By building on the ambitions of the Life Sciences Sector Plan to embed genomics in healthcare, integrating national datasets through the Wellcome NHRS, and aligning with updated regulation, we have a unique opportunity to deliver truly life-changing outcomes for patients. These reforms have the power to make the UK a global leader in rare disease innovation, driving inbound investment, transforming lives and ensuring that no patient is left behind simply because their disease is rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(Russ Dillingham/Staff Photographer)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What should I do if I hear about parvovirus cases near me?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus is a highly contagious, often deadly virus that has been reported among dogs in Androscoggin, Penobscot and &lt;a href="https://www.sunjournal.com/2025/10/22/parvo-alert-issued-in-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Oxford counties&lt;/a&gt;, plus other communities across Maine. If you hear of cases in your area, avoid taking your dog to a dog park or other public places where pets gather. The best protection against parvovirus is to get your dog vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is the rabies vaccine required for Maine’s pets?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. Dogs and cats that are 3 months or older are required by Maine law to be vaccinated against rabies, but state officials strongly recommend the vaccine for other animals such as ferrets, horses and livestock. Rabies is almost always fatal and is carried by common wildlife animals in Maine, including raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes.&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;“That’s the no-brainer,” David Cloutier, board president of the Maine Veterinary Medical Association, said of the rabies vaccine. “Just do it. They are incredibly effective and we see almost no reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What vaccines are recommended for dogs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Core vaccines are recommended for all dogs, regardless of lifestyle. They include vaccines for rabies, leptospirosis and a combination vaccine for several contagious and potentially deadly viral infections, according to American Animal Hospital Association guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combination distemper vaccine, known as a DAPP or DHPP vaccine, is a three-dose shot recommended 6-8 weeks after birth that protects against canine distemper virus, two types of adenovirus, parvovirus and parainfluenza. The vaccine for leptospirosis can be included in the combination distemper or administered separately.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Maine, tick-related vaccines are considered core by most experts, Cloutier said. “If you live in a place like Maine with a lot of ticks, it makes sense,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;For cats?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats are recommended to get the rabies vaccine at around 4 months. While vaccine types and schedules differ, cats are recommended to get core vaccines that protect against feline leukemia, panleukopenia, herpes virus and calicivirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How often should my pet get a booster?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dogs and cats should both get a rabies booster one year after their first dose, then every three years after that. The canine distemper vaccine follows the same schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are vaccines bad for my pet?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No. Vaccines have been proven to be a safe and effective way to prevent life-threatening diseases in animals. Some pets may experience mild, temporary side effects, but experts say the benefits of vaccinating against dangerous illnesses far outweigh any risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can viruses or diseases be transmitted between humans and pets?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. Rabies can be transmitted from animals to humans through bites or scratches. Leptospirosis, which can cause kidney damage, liver failure and death in humans, is spread through contact with the urine of infected animals, usually found in contaminated water or soil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What if I can’t pay for a vaccine or veterinary care?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many shelters and humane societies in Maine hold vaccination clinics at a low cost, including Bangor Humane Shelter, Greater Androscoggin Humane Society in Lewiston and Midcoast Humane in Brunswick. There are also vaccination clinics at several Petco and Tractor Supply Co. stores across Maine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinics are a low-cost, easily accessible way to get vaccines, Cloutier said. You don’t even need a relationship with a veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ll vaccinate them right on the bed of the truck, no questions asked, $10 a piece,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the most cost-effective way to keep veterinary costs low. The canine distemper combination vaccine costs between $20 and $100, while experts say treatment for parvovirus can cost thousands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Potential pet owners should consider whether they can afford vaccination and veterinary care before adopting a pet.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out, women may gain the same level of heart protection as men with nearly half the amount of activity as men. The study examined wearable device data from around 85,000 adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who exercised for almost 250 minutes a week, which is approximately 35 minutes a day, showed a 30 percent lower risk of developing heart disease. But here's the difference. For men to achieve the same heart protection from exercise of 30 percent lower risk, they need to do exercises for around 530 minutes a week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not solely for preventing heart diseases, but also the same is applicable for mitigating heart disease complications as well. Women with heart disease who met the recommended activity levels gained the advantage of a whopping 70 percent lower death reduction, compared to those women who stayed inactive. But when men did the same amount and duration of exercise, their risk reduction was only around 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sheds light on the global recommended activity levels, which are often general and not sex specific. The same 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per week is relevant for everyone, despite gender. But this study serves as an eye-opener, suggesting that exercise's benefits are effective not based on how long one works out but on how the body responds to the activity. This is particularly critical as men and women have greatly different biological responses and systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why do women's bodies respond differently?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/08/original/1049_1759934877054.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Muscle type and hormones help women gain better heart health benefits.

(Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason why women have an extra advantage here is due to the hormones and muscle composition. Estrogen, which is a sex hormone, is more common in women, causes fat metabolism when one is exercising. This is essentially an energy process where the body uses fat as fuel during exercise rather than relying on sugar. When fat for energy is used, it puts less pressure on the heart. This is why women have better heart health with less activity. Women also have more endurance-oriented muscle fibres (type I), unlike men, who have more power-oriented muscle fibres (type II).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All these biological variations make it possible for women to reap better rewards for cardiovascular health. For women, their hormones and muscles help them gain more benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Nutritionist Suman Agarwal, certified from Oxford University, in an Instagram post shared on October 31, listed 5 things people should do immediately to safeguard themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5 things to safeguard yourself from breast cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listing the 5 precautionary measures, the nutritionist wrote, “If you don't want your wife, your mother, or your sister to suffer from breast cancer, these are the five things you must do immediately.” Here's what she recommends:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Move daily and get your morning sun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling it the ‘most important step’, the nutritionist recommends daily movement and getting your dose of morning sun. “If you don't get enough oxygen in ways of exercise, you must move daily. Whether it is walking, jogging, paddling, pickleball, cycling, swimming, or any form of exercise is great,” she stressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Increase your protein intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the nutritionist suggests increasing protein intake in your diet. She stresses that protein deficiency is a very big problem. It is not just for muscle building, it is vital for antibodies and repairing tissues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your immune system relies on protein to defend against harmful bacteria and invaders, including cancer cells,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/02/original/breast_cancer_prevention_1762066896729.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="5 breast cancer prevention tips.

(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Avoid sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you know, food for cancer is sugar. So what you must avoid is junk food, desserts, ice cream, chocolates, aerated drinks, alcohol, and mithai (sweets). You don't have to completely avoid this food. You can have them, but only on occasions,” she warned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Manage your stress and your sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the nutritionist highlighted the importance of managing stress and sleep. She stated, “Chronic stress is one of the biggest reasons for disrupting your hormonal balance and suppressing your immune system.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is why long-standing sleep deprivation weakens your immune system and increases the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Monthly check-ups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last, but most important, I recommend everyone to do monthly checks of their breast and visit their gynaecologist on a yearly basis for screening,” the nutritionist stressed. Early detection of cancer can save your loved ones' lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
