Utah experts advise a radon test&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think about family history, genetics, or age when they think about Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While those factors are well known, researchers are now studying whether long-term exposure to certain environmental conditions may also influence cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those conditions is radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas found throughout Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah health and environmental experts encourage residents to pay attention to radon levels in their homes, especially because radon exposure builds slowly over time and can go unnoticed for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test kit at &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_top" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is radon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon forms naturally as uranium in soil and rock breaks down. It moves upward and can enter homes through small openings in foundations, basements, crawl spaces and utility gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon has no color, taste, or odor, so homeowners cannot detect it without a test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the [Envionmental Protection Agency](Envionmental Protection Agency), long-term radon exposure is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah has a higher radon potential than many other states due to its unique geology. Recent data shows that almost half of all Utah homes have elevated radon levels, underscoring the importance of routine testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do we know about Alzheimer's risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients are 65 and older, and the likelihood of developing the disease increases with age. Genetics, family history and certain heart and blood vessel conditions may also contribute to increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Beaunitta Van Wyk/peopleimages.com - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does research say about radon and cognitive health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are continuing to study whether long-term exposure to radon may affect neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28671130/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in Environmental Health Perspectives found evidence that ionizing radiation may contribute to cellular changes associated with Alzheimer's. The authors noted that these effects may accumulate over many years of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasize that more studies are needed before drawing firm conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, because radon exposure is preventable, Utah residents have an opportunity to reduce one potential environmental risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is simple. Families can order a free test kit from &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_mid" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why radon testing matters for Utah families&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Utah homeowners who test their homes are surprised by their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because radon has no symptoms and no noticeable signs, homes with elevated levels often appear completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing is straightforward. UtahRadon.org provides free test kits to all Utah residents. The test only takes a few minutes to place in the home and is then mailed to a certified third-party laboratory for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If your home tests high&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels can be reduced by installing a mitigation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These systems are installed by certified professionals and are designed to continuously vent radon from beneath the home to the outside air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most installations are completed in a single visit and begin lowering radon levels immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radon is invisible and odorless, but it is measurable, and homeowners have control over their exposure. Testing allows families to understand their risk and take action if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah residents can request a free radon test by visiting &lt;a href="https://utahradon.org/landing-page/?utm_source=ksl&amp;amp;utm_medium=native&amp;amp;utm_campaign=alzheimers_article&amp;amp;utm_content=cta_bottom" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;UtahRadon.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The only way to detect radon is to test for it. A simple do-it-yourself radon test kit can save a life.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Many cancer doctors hope that tests like Galleri, which are sometimes called &lt;a href="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://google.com/search?q=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1163US1168&amp;amp;oq=jonathan+saltzman+and+liquid+biopsies&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIKCAEQABiABBiiBDIKCAIQABiABBiiBDIHCAMQABjvBTIHCAQQABjvBTIHCAUQABjvBdIBCDc2MTBqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;“liquid biopsies,”&lt;/a&gt; will transform cancer care by detecting the earliest signs of malignancy, enabling treatment before the disease becomes deadly. They are part of an accelerating effort to find cancer earlier and earlier, through blood tests as well as new techniques and artificial intelligence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The goal is to take the same energy and skill that has been deployed to develop treatments for cancer, and put it to work at finding cancer early enough to stop it in its tracks, said Dr. Betsy O’Donnell, director of the Multi-Cancer Early Detection Clinic at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“How do we move from a reactive model where we are only picking up cancers when they declare themselves?” she said. O’Donnell is leading &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/clinical-trials/24-070" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; of the Galleri test, recruiting 1,000 people at high risk for cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Today, 70 percent of cancers have no screening test. People can be screened for cancers of the colon, breast, cervix, prostate, and, for heavy smokers, lung. Other tumors often grow without symptoms and are discovered when it’s too late to effectively treat them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The path to catching more cancers early is fraught with challenges. To be most effective, screening has to do more than just detect cancer: It has to find the right cancer at the right moment. When a test turns up cancer so indolent it was never going to harm the patient, it only sows fear and can lead to needless procedures. When it finds a cancer that is so aggressive there’s no stopping it, its value can be limited.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You really want a screening test that finds the cancer and leads to the patient not dying,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, a noted expert in cancer prevention and control at Johns Hopkins University, who has consulted for GRAIL.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When Burns White, 66, of Randolph, returned from the jazz festival, she was not immediately concerned. She’d been told that more often than not, a positive result from Galleri proves to be a false alarm. Her primary care doctor told her not to worry. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the result was pretty specific: It said cancer might be lurking in her breast, esophagus, and stomach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So Burns White consulted with doctors from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where she works in community outreach and engagement. Two years ago, the hospital launched its &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/cancer-care/treatment/early-detection-interception" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Early Detection and Interception&lt;/a&gt;, which works with patients at high risk of cancer, those who receive troubling results from liquid biopsies, and others who learn of hard-to-interpret abnormalities from tests done for another purpose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White endured an endoscopy, an uncomfortable procedure involving threading a tube with a camera down her throat. The result was good news: no cancer of the esophagus or stomach. It would be a different story for breast cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A mammogram she had taken a few months before had detected masses — but they looked benign. The results of the GRAIL test “pushed us to look closer,” said O’Donnell, of Dana-Farber. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Burns White underwent another set of mammograms, followed by MRIs and biopsies of both breasts. Doctors told her she had triple-negative breast cancer, a form that can be difficult to treat but that was still at an early stage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Multicancer blood tests eventually will “change the face of early detection for cancer,” said Timothy R. Rebbeck, professor of cancer prevention at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But they still need more work because, while they catch some cancers at an early stage, others are missed, he said. And even a screening tool that saves lives can have costs: follow-up testing and sometimes needless treatment, as well as “the psychosocial costs of having to go through all of this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Recent preliminary &lt;a href="https://cslide.ctimeetingtech.com/esmo2025/attendee/confcal/presentation/list?q=Galleri" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;results from the largest study of GRAIL’s Galleri test&lt;/a&gt; showed its promise and limitations. Galleri found many types of cancer for which there is no screening test, and 92 percent of the time it correctly identified where in the body the cancer originated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The test was administered to 36,000 people aged 50 and older. Among the first 25,000 analyzed, Galleri&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;found a “cancer signal” in 216 cases — and cancer was confirmed in 133, about 60 percent. That compares favorably with &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq#_80_toc" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;mammography&lt;/a&gt;, said Megan P. Hall, vice president of medical and corporate affairs at GRAIL; she cited data showing that when a woman is called back for a follow-up mammogram, only 4 to 5 percent turn out to have cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But there were more false negatives than true positives — 196 people were told the test found no cancer but went on to develop it within the next year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And, even though its purpose is early detection, nearly half the cancer cases the test found were already advanced. That’s because advanced cancers shed more DNA and are easier to pick up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The endgame in early detection may come down to better defining who is most at risk and thus most likely to benefit from screening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For example, pancreatic cancer is almost always detected at an advanced stage. But it’s so rare that it would make no sense to screen everybody. Researchers are looking for ways to identify a subset of high-risk people who would benefit from screening,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Limor Appelbaum, a staff scientist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/24/metro/ai-predict-pancreatic-cancer/?p1" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;deploying AI&lt;/a&gt; to comb through the medical records of millions of patients, looking for patterns common among those who went on to develop pancreatic cancers, such as changes in blood chemistry or more frequent doctor’s visits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Dana-Farber, researchers have identified one possible warning sign of pancreatic cancer: muscle loss. By studying blood samples from people who developed pancreatic cancer going back years before their diagnosis, and also looking at CT scans, researchers led by Dr. Brian Wolpin and Dr. Michael H. Rosenthal found evidence that the pancreas starts to falter, performing its key functions less well, long before any tumor forms. This weakens the body’s ability to absorb proteins in the diet, causing it to break down muscle. But many factors can cause muscle loss, so further study is needed before these measures can be put to use. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors are working on a warning system for lung cancer. An AI program called Sybil scanned thousands of chest X-rays of people who were later diagnosed with the disease and learned the patterns seen before someone develops cancer in the lung, said Dr. Lecia Sequist, program director of the &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/treatments-and-services/cancer-early-detection" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Early Detection and Diagnostics Clinic&lt;/a&gt; at the Mass General Brigham Cancer Institute. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“My vision for 25 years from now,” said Dana-Farber’s O’Donnell, “is that when you go to your primary care physician’s appointment, they say, ‘This is your risk score, and here are the screening tests you need.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who calls himself a “healthy skeptic” of cancer screening, would like to see the opposite: “If you want to lower the burden on patients,” he said, “develop the test that tells people they’re at low risk for cancer and [can] stop worrying about it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As for Burns White, she’s happy with how the Galleri test played out for her. Once her breast cancer was diagnosed, she underwent numerous rounds of chemotherapy, a lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. Today, a little over a year since her diagnosis, she continues to take a medication aimed at eradicating the remaining cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Through it all, Burns White continued to work, taking off only a few days for the surgery. She expects her treatment to end in mid-December. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I remain strong and optimistic,” she said, “and grateful to have had access to treatment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

The researchers found that, in 28 days, people in the urolithin A group had changes in biomarkers associated with age-related immune decline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Urolithin A leads to better cell function, but it also has a positive impact on muscle,” says study co-author &lt;a href="https://georg-speyer-haus.de/en/forschung/forschungsgruppen/prof-dr-florian-greten" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Florian Greten;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Florian Greten&lt;/a&gt;, MD, researcher and director of the Georg-Speyer-Haus Institut für Tumorbiologie. (Separate early &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests urolithin A has the potential to enhance muscle health and performance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Greten says it’s “exciting” that he and other researchers were able to detect these positive changes within a month. “We don’t know yet if you can take a lower amount and get a similar impact, but we are studying that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urolithin A is a bioactive compound that’s produced in the gut when certain compounds (mostly ellagitannins and ellagic acid) are broken down by specific gut bacteria, explains Jessica Cording, RD, CDN, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-Game-Changers-Managing/dp/163228068X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Little Book of Game-Changers;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Game-Changers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the catch: Not everyone produces urolithin A efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that only about 40 percent of people have the right gut microbiome for this,” Dr. Greten says. If you don’t have the "right" microbiome, meaning you're missing certain necessary bacteria, your gut won’t produce this compound efficiently through foods, he says, adding that there’s no publicly available test to see if you have these bacteria or not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, urolithin A supplements can theoretically work despite missing certain bacteria since it doesn't need to be converted, Dr. Greten says. Remember: Always talk to your doctor before trying any new supplement, including urolithin A, especially if you have preexisting medical conditions or are taking any medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of Dr. Greten's study, here’s some additional preliminary research swirling around urolithin A. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10609777/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Early research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Early research&lt;/a&gt; indicates urolithin A may support healthy aging by enhancing how your cells produce and recycle energy,” says Keri Gans, RDN, author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Small-Change-Diet-Thinner-Healthier/dp/145160890X?linkCode=ogi&amp;amp;tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.69512932%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Small Change Diet;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Small Change Diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;Some small human &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788244" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also suggest it could improve muscle endurance and aspects of immune function, but the research is still preliminary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What foods contain urolithin A?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the research surrounding urolithin A involves supplements, but certain foods may spark a process in your body that &lt;em&gt;creates&lt;/em&gt; urolithin A. “It’s not found in large amounts in food, but your body creates it after you eat foods that are rich in these precursor compounds,” Cording says. (But Cording stresses that your individual microbiome plays a big role in whether or not your body can do this.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those foods include &lt;strong&gt;pomegranate&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;walnuts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;raspberries&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;blackberries&lt;/strong&gt;. “Eating these foods regularly may help, but the amount of urolithin A you generate varies from person to person,” she says, even if you do have the "right" bacteria to make it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have the right microbiome, eating and drinking these foods can lead to the production of urolithin A,” Dr. Greten says. But even then, you’d need to have a lot of these foods—Dr. Greten says you’d need to have 1.5 liters of pomegranate juice a day to mimic the effects of the supplement used in his study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately experts say that more research is needed around urolithin A. In the meantime, there are other things you can do to support longevity. “Don’t overlook lifestyle approaches to supporting healthy mitochondrial function, such as eating a well-balanced diet rich in &lt;a href="https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/krnc/monthly-blog/what-are-polyphenols-another-great-reason-to-eat-fruits-and-veggies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polyphenols;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;, exercising, prioritizing restful sleep, and managing stress,” Cording says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 17:39:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNdnJWZG5zMnNNQkhhdWRBdncyNENjNUY2T2NNN3pNS0w2VF9JU0VxLUI4aV9YTTRGNDI4Ql9oV1gwSFBsd210X1JpX1dfUXY3QkpkMUhCS2lBOTZOU1VsaFFCdmFUWmxoNnNFT3ZfUEo1N0VvRm1zLXpYRlVXWHp1U0pvQzRrSTdW</guid></item><item><title>无耻的ROBOCALL ：罗克兰县发送未经授权的麻疹警报滥用Hatzoloh的名字- Monsey Scoop</title><link>https://monseyscoop.com/outrageous-robocall-rockland-county-sends-unauthorized-measles-alert-misusing-hatzolohs-name/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tdb-block-inner td-fix-index"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramapo residents woke up Wednesday morning to a shocking and unauthorized robocall blasted to thousands of homes in the Town of Ramapo, a call falsely presented as an “urgent notification from Hatzoloh of Rockland County,” warning of a community measles outbreak and urging residents to call Hatzoloh’s emergency hotline with questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prerecorded message stated that “a measles outbreak has occurred in our community,” instructing residents to get vaccinated, avoid public places if symptomatic, and to call Hatzoloh at 845-425-1600 for guidance, overwhelming the volunteer EMS organization with a sudden influx of non-emergency calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzoloh of Rockland County confirmed to Monsey Scoop that the robocall was completely unauthorized, not coordinated with them in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While measles is indeed a concern in various parts of the region, Hatzoloh emphasized that medical guidance, including vaccination questions, should be directed to personal physicians, not emergency hotlines intended for life-saving situations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzoloh further noted that their hotline was “bombarded with unnecessary calls” following the county-issued robocall, potentially delaying response to genuine emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community leaders and residents alike expressed outrage that Rockland County disseminated a medical advisory using Hatzoloh’s name without permission, creating confusion and placing undue burden on a volunteer emergency service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health concerns must always be taken seriously, and residents are urged to &lt;strong&gt;consult their doctors regarding vaccination, symptoms, and medical guidance&lt;/strong&gt;. But the county’s decision to issue a robocall in Hatzoloh’s name, without authorization, has raised significant questions about procedure, communication, and respect for community partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Norovirus cases have risen in the United States in recent weeks, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 14% of tests for the illness came back positive during the week that ended on Nov. 15, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nrevss/php/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. Over 2,700 tests were conducted that week, according to the CDC, meaning that about 380 cases of norovirus were diagnosed in that period.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's more than double the percentage of positive tests recorded about three months ago, when test positivity in the U.S. this year was at its lowest. The week that ended on Aug. 9 saw a 6.53% positivity rate of more than 4,240 tests conducted during that period, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test positivity is an imperfect metric because it can vary based on the number of tests conducted. The CDC's data is based on reports from participating laboratories, hospitals and health departments. Test positivity rates can help provide general data about what diseases are circulating and when, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus, sometimes known as the stomach bug or stomach flu, is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the leading cause of foodborne illness, the agency says on its website. Norovirus is extremely contagious and causes symptoms including nausea, belly pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Most people experience symptoms for one to three days. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of people are sickened with norovirus every year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;, and about 2,500 outbreaks of norovirus are reported in the U.S. each year. The illness results in over 100,000 hospitalizations and about 900 deaths per year. Adults 65 and older are the most likely to die from norovirus, the CDC said. Young children and those with compromised immune systems are also at a higher risk for severe illness or death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of norovirus are most common between November and April, the CDC says. Last winter, the U.S. saw a major surge of norovirus, with a more than 25% test positivity rate &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/norovirus-wave-twice-last-year-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;recorded in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, earlier this month, a potential outbreak prompted a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/wilson-middle-school-closed-potential-norovirus-outbreak/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Michigan middle school&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to close for a day for deep cleaning after dozens of students &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/norovirus-cases-on-the-rise-what-to-know-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;reported feeling ill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Nearly 100 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/norovirus-outbreak-on-cruise-ship-sickens-nearly-100-people/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cruise ship passengers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were sickened by norovirus in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing hands frequently, safely handling and preparing food, and regularly cleaning surfaces can help prevent norovirus from spreading, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. The disease is also contagious after symptoms end, so people should continue these precautions for at least two days after they begin to feel better, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;

A study by Monash University in Australia now suggests that music can lighten the burden of this process, as the innate joy and comfort from it can also help retain functionality, which is a major win for those accustomed to soundtracking their lives; turns out songs have the power to preserve life and, to some extent, the hope for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in October 2025, the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.70163" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; was conducted by honours student Emma Jaffa and Professor Joanne Ryan, who monitored more than 10,800 adults over the age of 70, drawing a stark parallel between listening to music regularly and a 39% reduction in the risk of dementia. More specifically, those who formed the habit of getting through each day in conjunction with their favourite tunes also produced “better global cognition and memory scores”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found significant benefits attached to playing an instrument, and although supplementing a love for music with the practice of playing did illustrate a 35% lower risk of dementia, there was no substantial evidence that it positively impacts cognitive test scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, those who combined listening to music and playing it demonstrated the most promising results, as doing both was linked to a 33% reduced risk of dementia and a 22% decline in cognitive impairment that isn’t related to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that those who were actively learning as part of the education system for 16 years or more benefited from the above habits more than people who weren’t in school and college for that many years, while additionally showing that these patterns seem to have no bearing on how the subjects perceive themselves or their overall cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these findings aren’t definitive since they are essentially conclusions drawn from positioning a specific set of practices alongside a timeline of mental well-being; however, simultaneously, music does generate positive results regardless of its potential influence on dementia, so there’s a strong case to be made in favour of encouraging elderly people to listen to their favourite songs as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/soundtrack-superiority-should-we-be-doing-more-to-engage-with-the-music-we-listen-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""&gt;Music makes life worth living&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s no surprise that it might even help extend our time on this planet. We often tether our memories to the songs we love, and there’s something quite beautiful and poetic about the way the moments we cherish most can live on within the art we value deeply, and these moments keep the art alive even in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe title="Elliott Smith – Memory Lane (from From A Basement On The Hill)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-uDPv7iQEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="tags-title hf"&gt;Related Topics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/article&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Far Out Magazine</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSDYxWkhYTlg3T0pmLV9XTXA5Ujh3U3dRTHZGZnZqUm9vTFFDZjRzWG5rTjhCMHFpclR4ZThwQS1oMXYyWW8tYkxPcnZWWXA4V1lOLVAxNkN3TVJYZUV2MWZoQzdqSmZ0MHlCeGUycHQ4VllwRURTNUtaaER6akVYalRRYw</guid></item><item><title>5种不同寻常的健康习惯专家宣誓效忠，包括嗡嗡声-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/unusual-wellness-habits-from-experts/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this age of booming social media, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wellness trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; are everywhere.

Researchers say positive results from around a dozen studies over the past three years suggest CAR-T-cell therapy could eventually be used treat any disease in which the immune system attacks the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T-cell therapy exploits the immune system’s T cells that fight off infection: these cells are collected from a person and tweaked to produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors. They are then reintroduced into the body to target antigens expressed by B cells, another type of immune cell. In autoimmune disorders, these B cells make antibodies that attack the body’s own healthy tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The use of the therapy for immune conditions has exploded since 2021, when a 20-year-old woman in Germany with severe lupus became the first person with an autoimmune disorder to be treated with CAR T cells&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Clinician–researcher David Simon, who was involved in that treatment&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, says the CAR-T therapies have since entered phase I and II clinical trials for autoimmune conditions including systemic sclerosis, myositis and rheumatoid arthritis. Phase III trials are also under way for lupus and myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes weakness in the muscles that are used to breathe, swallow and see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon, who focuses on rheumatoid arthritis at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, says people in CAR-T-cell therapy trials for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to be ‘cured’. “They lose their autoantibodies which trigger the disease, and they don’t have any symptoms anymore,” he adds. “This is something totally new which we didn’t observe before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAR-T-cell therapy has become a routine treatment for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00241-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;several types of cancer&lt;/a&gt; since it was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22304" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;first approved&lt;/a&gt; to treat blood cancers in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new frontier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulcerative colitis, a condition that affects the colon and causes stomach pain, ulcers and bloody diarrhoea, is one of the latest diseases in which CAR-T-cell therapy has shown promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, gastroenterologist Markus Neurath and his colleagues at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany, reported using CAR T cells to treat a 21-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. After the treatment, she showed signs of remission that persisted for 14 weeks, no longer needed medication and could return to work. “The result was quite amazing,” adds Neurath. His team plans to test the treatment in a few more people before proceeding to a controlled clinical trial involving many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Bing Du, an immunologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai, and his team published the results of a CAR-T pilot study using immune cells from a donor to treat drug-resistant lupus&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Donor-derived cells could act like a generic version of CAR-T treatment that could be mass-produced, cutting manufacturing time and lowering costs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Last year, Du was also involved in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03209-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03209-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;world-first study&lt;/a&gt; of bioengineered and modified immune cells from a donor for the treatment of two rare and severe autoimmune diseases&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the latest study, four women with a form of lupus that affects multiple organs received chemotherapy to reduce levels of their white blood cells, followed by an infusion of donor-derived CAR T cells. After three months, the women no longer experienced symptoms such as arthritis, swelling of blood vessels and alopecia, and one was in remission and no longer needed any medication. The other three women received low-dose steroids as a maintenance therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the trial were “much better than we could imagine”, says Du, and might be due to CAR T cells triggering the total depletion of dysfunctional B cells that attack the body’s tissues. “The immune system had to reset not only B cells, but also the rest of the immune system,” he adds, potentially allowing new, healthy B cells to replace the dysfunctional cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Childhood – from birth to age nine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adolescence – from nine to 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adulthood – from 32 to 66&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early ageing – from 66 to 83&lt;/li&gt;

Performance varied slightly between species, with the best results obtained for &lt;i&gt;E. rectale&lt;/i&gt; (balanced accuracy = 0.8; average precision = 0.73) and the weakest predictions for &lt;i&gt;B. thetaiotaomicron&lt;/i&gt; (balanced accuracy = 0.73; average precision = 0.52).

Although a model trained and tested on the combined pesticide–drug dataset showed similar performance, cross-predictions from one dataset to another showed poorer performance (approximate balanced accuracy = 0.7; average precision = 0.2). This indicates that pesticides and drugs are overall different in both chemical and activity space (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig3"&gt;3a&lt;/a&gt;).

All Tn::&lt;i&gt;acrR&lt;/i&gt; isolates showed resistance to both chemicals, regardless of the compound they were isolated on (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig4"&gt;4c&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig9"&gt;5c&lt;/a&gt;). When further evaluating two Tn::&lt;i&gt;acrR&lt;/i&gt; strains, we observed an eightfold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for closantel compared with the wild-type strain.

Therefore, resistance to closantel and TBBPA can lead to cross-resistance to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differential enrichment of &lt;i&gt;acrR&lt;/i&gt; Tn mutants suggests a degree of specificity in the efflux of chemicals and/or that efflux alone is insufficient in tackling the other chemicals. However, some transporter Tn mutants showed broad pollutant sensitivity, indicating common pollutant tolerance mechanisms in &lt;i&gt;P. merdae&lt;/i&gt;. For example, strains with insertions in genes of the &lt;i&gt;fadL&lt;/i&gt; family of hydrophobic compound transporters (&lt;i&gt;NQ542_07320&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;NQ542_08455&lt;/i&gt;) were prevalent negative fitness hits across seven xenobiotics, whereas insertion mutants of the RND multidrug efflux locus &lt;i&gt;NQ542_06240–50&lt;/i&gt; were a significant hit across five chemicals (Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41564-025-02182-6#Fig8"&gt;4c&lt;/a&gt;).

In the United States, for example, government researchers last year reported that more than 11% of children had received an ADHD diagnosis at some point in their lives&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — a sharp increase from 2003, when around 8% of children had (see ‘ADHD among US boys and girls’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03143-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51483336.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why is autism really on the rise? What the science says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, top US health officials argue that diagnoses have spiralled out of control. In May, the Make America Healthy Again Commission — led by US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr — said ADHD was part of a “crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment” and suggested that ADHD medications did not help children in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what, exactly, is going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that’s clear is that several factors — including improved detection and greater awareness of ADHD — are causing people with symptoms to receive a diagnosis and treatment, whereas they wouldn’t have years earlier. Clinicians say this is especially true for women and girls, whose pattern of symptoms was often missed in the past. Although some specialists are concerned about the risks of overdiagnosis, many are more worried that too many people go undiagnosed and untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the rise in awareness and diagnoses of ADHD has fuelled a public debate about how it should be viewed and how best to provide support, including when medication is required. The emergence of the neurodiversity movement is challenging the view of ADHD as a disorder that should be ‘treated’, and instead proposes that it’s a difference that should be better understood and supported — with more focus on adapting schools and workplaces, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51741560.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51741560.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ADHD among US boys and girls.

It’s not the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many clinicians and people with ADHD argue that it is associated with difficulties — ranging from academic struggles to an increased chance of injuries and substance misuse — that justify its label as a medical condition, and say that medication is an important and effective part of therapy for many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hear a lot of people talking about ADHD being a gift and a superpower, and I do applaud that,” says Jeremy Didier, a clinician specializing in ADHD who is president of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit–Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), a non-profit US group based in Lanham, Maryland, and who has ADHD herself. “But I do not want to downplay the impact that ADHD can have on someone’s life when it’s either undiagnosed or poorly managed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and others say both models — neurodiversity and medical — have merit. “Bringing those two together in a meaningful and productive way, I think that’s maybe the biggest challenge” for the field, says Sven Bölte, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatric science at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A real rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slew of studies suggests that diagnoses of ADHD have gone up in many high-income countries in the past two to three decades — similar to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;rise in autism diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; (see ‘ADHD on the rise’). The rate of new ADHD diagnoses in the United Kingdom, for example, doubled in boys and quadrupled in girls between 2000 and 2018, according to one study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In adults, the rate shot up even more. “We have numbers suggesting that we’re seeing a rise,” says Max Wiznitzer, a paediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51741554.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51741554.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="ADHD on the rise.

It doesn’t seem to be a big rise in the prevalence of the symptoms and traits that characterize ADHD — namely hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, researchers say. When scientists use standard procedures to rigorously assess symptoms in representative samples of a population, they find that the ‘true’ prevalence of ADHD is fairly consistent in different parts of the world — estimated at around 5.4% in children&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and 2.6% in adults&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, according to two comprehensive global studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say there are several reasons these figures are much lower than the 11% diagnosis level in US children that the country’s health authorities reported last year&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. That number comes from the US National Survey of Children’s Health conducted in 2022, in which parents were asked whether a doctor or other health-care provider had ever said their child has ADHD. But this method of assessing prevalence would lead to inflated counts, says Luis Rohde, a psychiatrist and ADHD specialist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Some children were probably misdiagnosed — perhaps by a physician without specialist training — and would not be classified as having ADHD in a thorough clinical evaluation. Some parents might have misremembered, perhaps if they were told that their child had symptoms without a formal diagnosis, he says. And some children who once had a diagnosis would no longer have received one at the time of the survey if their symptoms had waned and they were reassessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01969-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51250548.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make America healthy: the real problems — and best fixes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and specialists highlight other factors that are likely to be driving up the number of diagnoses. One is a change in diagnostic criteria in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;DSM&lt;/i&gt;). In the fourth edition of this widely used manual, introduced in 1994, a child or adult ADHD diagnosis required the presence of at least six of a list of nine inattention symptoms and/or six or more of nine hyperactivity symptoms, and stipulated that these had to be present before the age of seven. (This reflects the idea that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that arises during childhood brain development.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the fifth edition, &lt;i&gt;DSM-V,&lt;/i&gt; arrived in 2013, the criteria were slightly relaxed. Symptoms had to be present before age 12, and adult diagnosis required a minimum of five symptoms. (Children still had to have at least six.) “So when we expand the criteria, obviously you increase a little bit the prevalence,” says Rohde, who was involved in those revisions. It has also become more common for clinicians to diagnose ADHD along with other conditions, when in the past they tended to focus on one, says Bölte: “That fuels the figures.” ADHD commonly occurs with autism, as well as with anxiety, depression and other disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The impairment requirement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a thorough ADHD assessment involves collecting a detailed history and completing behaviour questionnaires, including input from family members and, for children, from schools. In the United States, the condition can be diagnosed by a range of health professionals, including psychiatrists, other mental-health specialists and primary-care physicians such as paediatricians, who might not have dedicated training in ADHD. But countries differ: in Brazil and many other low- and middle-income nations, people with ADHD symptoms tend to be sent to neurologists and psychiatrists for ADHD assessment and diagnoses, and there is a shortage of such specialists, Rohde says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;DSM-V&lt;/i&gt; defines three ‘presentations’ of ADHD. People with ‘predominantly inattentive’ ADHD show symptoms such as making careless mistakes, struggling to sustain attention, losing things and being easily distracted. Those with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD have traits such as fidgeting, restlessness, talking excessively and interrupting others. In a third, combined presentation, people show both sets of symptoms. A diagnosis requires that symptoms are present for at least six months and in two or more settings (such as school, home, work); are not explained by another condition such as anxiety; and cause an impairment, such as struggling with schoolwork, losing a job or having relationship problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51736478.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51736478.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Conceptual illustration showing an abstract human profile with a jumbled pink string inside." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51736478.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Illustration by Ada Zielińska&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impairment requirement is key, clinicians say. These traits vary across the population: some individuals are very hyperactive or inattentive, and some not at all. But people tend to be diagnosed with ADHD when their symptoms significantly interfere with their lives. “The medical part of ADHD comes in when your life is becoming derailed,” says Margaret Sibley, a specialist in psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bölte says that clinicians are interpreting the diagnostic criteria “far more liberally and openly” than in the past. This is another factor — aside from changes in the diagnostic criteria — that is driving the apparent surge in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But working out when someone crosses the impairment line involves a subjective and sometimes tricky judgement, say specialists. And there is an ongoing debate about whether a person’s level of impairment should be defined relative to their own potential or to a population average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s clear is that more parents as well as children are deemed as crossing that threshold. Wiznitzer says that when he diagnoses a child, “almost invariably [one of] the parents has it”, too. (That’s because genes are a major contributor to ADHD: the disorder has a heritability&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of roughly 70–80%.) Even though the parents were probably symptomatic as children, many were not identified as having the condition, he says. But now, they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;ADHD on TikTok&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason why diagnoses have surged is an increase in public awareness of ADHD — fuelled by an explosion of discussion on TikTok and other social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information online “connects with some people who have had these symptoms and impairments for a long time, but never understood what they were,” says Sibley. That leads them to seek information and professional help, pushing diagnoses up. And people might be eager to receive a diagnosis if it allows them to access help and services for themselves or a child, such as adaptations to support learning at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge in ADHD has led to concerns, particularly in the United States, about questionable diagnoses being given without a thorough clinical evaluation — through online services, for example, or by medical professionals without ADHD training. “They’ve got a visit for 15 or 20 minutes, and the diagnosis is made,” says Stephen Hinshaw, a specialist in child and adolescent mental health and ADHD at the University of California, Berkeley. But Didier says that a bigger problem is the number of people with ADHD who are undiagnosed or untreated. She emphasizes how important it is for people to have access to a thorough, accurate assessment from a trained professional who specializes in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of recognition of ADHD is a particular problem in low- and middle-income countries, says Rohde. “The problem here is clearly underdiagnosis, stigma and undertreatment,” he says, which particularly affects “vulnerable people and communities”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02636-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03855-2/d41586-025-03855-2_51426444.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Autism is on the rise: what’s really behind the increase?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many specialists say they’re observing a rapid rise of diagnoses in girls and women&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In part, that’s thought to be because women and girls are more likely to have symptoms of inattention — rather than more-noticeable hyperactivity — and to find organizational and other strategies that ‘mask’ those symptoms. Didier says that, despite being an ADHD specialist and diagnosing the condition in three of her sons, she and other ADHD practitioners missed the signs and symptoms in her daughter until she was a teenager. “It’s egregious that we don’t have more research on ADHD trajectories in women,” Sibley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the world itself are yet another possible contributor to increased diagnoses. Some researchers speculate that schools, work, technology and other aspects of modern lives have become so complex and taxing that they are pushing more people beyond the threshold of impairment. In Sweden, says Bölte, schools are sometimes chaotic, with complex schedules and grading systems. “Many students are very confused and fed up with school and do not understand it any more,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published last year&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; revealed that parents think their children are struggling more. The research team examined how parents viewed the ADHD symptoms of more than 27,000 nine-year-old children born in Sweden. Parents consulted in 2016–18 tended to say that their children were more impaired than did parents consulted in 2004–06, even though their kids had the same number of symptoms. “Environment around the child is crucial,” says Samuele Cortese, who studies ADHD at the University of Southampton, UK, and was involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Context is key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karp describes ADHD as “context-dependent”. In a school where children are expected to sit still and be quiet, “it makes these traits seem like a problem”, he says. But when someone with ADHD is in an environment that nurtures and empowers them, they “can then channel their neurotype to do incredible things”. Karp is not against medication — and sometimes takes it himself — but would like more emphasis on institutions and society evolving so that people with ADHD can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, meanwhile, are finding evidence that the severity of symptoms can vary over time. In a 2021 study, Sibley and her colleagues analysed detailed records of more than 550 children who were diagnosed with ADHD and followed for up to 16 years&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The researchers found that 64% of young people had fluctuations in ADHD — times when their symptoms faded but then recurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibley and her team hypothesized that people’s symptoms might flare up when they were facing increased demands in their lives, such as when starting a new school or having a child. But in fact, the opposite seemed to be true, according to a later analysis by Sibley and her colleagues&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This could be because people are able to take on more responsibility when their symptoms abate. But the alternative explanation — one that has “really resonated”, Sibley says — is that people with ADHD need a degree of activity and accountability in their lives to perform and stay engaged. Sibley thinks there might be a U-shaped curve: too many or too few demands and obligations mean that people with ADHD don’t function at their best — but at a “sweet spot”, they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOILING SPRINGS, S.C. — Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;more than 1,700 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/"&gt;in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/#:~:text=Measles%20has%20been%20officially%20%E2%80%9Celiminated,in%20any%20year%20since%201992."&gt;elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schools and ‘Small Brush Fires’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before covid,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding covid vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to &lt;a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/features/your_health/religious-exemptions-for-school-vaccine-requirements-worry-public-health-experts-in-south-carolina/article_86dc5de0-926f-11e7-93ba-47e9fd2cff5f.html"&gt;data published by The Post and Courier&lt;/a&gt;. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Health Freedom’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/cdc-autism-baseless-new-guidance-website/"&gt;have been ignored by health authorities&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2025, he has made other &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/"&gt;misleading or unsupported statements&lt;/a&gt;. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We’re not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s covid vaccine outreach efforts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a covid vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for covid vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their covid response. In Missouri, where &lt;a href="https://health.mo.gov/living/families/schoolhealth/dashboard.php"&gt;MMR vaccine rates have declined&lt;/a&gt; among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2022-02-01/missouri-senate-rejects-governors-pick-for-health-director-over-support-for-covid-vaccines"&gt;rejected a public health director&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers’ confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/stronger-safety-controls-be-introduced-products-containing-vitamin-b6"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a raft of changes to how products containing vitamin B6 are packaged and sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGA decision is based on an extensive review, prompted by &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-26/tga-confirms-removal-of-toxic-vitamin-b6-from-shelves/106052270"&gt;widespread concerns&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that high doses were causing toxicity and leading to lasting nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGA &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/stronger-safety-controls-be-introduced-products-containing-vitamin-b6"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the tighter controls – which include restrictions on over-the-counter sales for higher doses – will strike a balance between the vitamin’s benefits and its potential harms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may leave some people confused about whether vitamin B6 is safe to take. How much is too much? And can I still buy my supplement over-the-counter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin B6 do we need?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B6 (also known as pyridoxine, pyridoxamine and pyridoxal) is an essential vitamin for good health, involved in more than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.06.023"&gt;140 processes&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can’t produce it ourselves, so we need to get it elsewhere – mainly from our diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B6 can be found in a wide range of foods, including animal products such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plant-based sources include: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;legumes (such as chickpeas, lentils and beans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vegetables (including potatoes, spinach, carrots and kale)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fruits (such as avocado, bananas and oranges)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grains (including corn, brown rice, oats and fortified cereals). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recommended dietary daily intake of B6 varies based on age. So wherever you get it – diet or supplements – this is the recommended amount per day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/vitamin-b6"&gt;upper recommended limit&lt;/a&gt; for healthy adults is 50mg/day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the recommended intake is lower for infants and people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. For detailed information, visit the government’s &lt;a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrient-reference-values/nutrients/vitamin-b6"&gt;Eat for Health website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too much vs too little&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to diseases including some kinds of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djw230"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1569826"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; disorders, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2023.1237103"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (such as heart attacks or strokes). However, this kind of deficiency &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/stronger-safety-controls-be-introduced-products-containing-vitamin-b6"&gt;is not common&lt;/a&gt; in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, some people choose to take vitamin B6 as a supplement. Or they may take other products and be unaware they contain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can increase the risk of having too much – which can be &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/vitamin-b6-is-essential-but-too-much-can-be-toxic-heres-what-to-know-to-stay-safe-248443"&gt;toxic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking high doses of vitamin B6 over a long time can lead to poisoning and &lt;a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/vitamin-b6-toxicity"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; peripheral neuropathy. This condition damages the nervous system and causes pain, weakness, numbness and tingling, mainly in the limbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toxicity from food sources is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554500/"&gt;extremely rare&lt;/a&gt;, including among individuals with enzyme deficiencies that slow B6 metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all documented vitamin B6 toxicity results from excessive supplement intake, as levels found in natural foods remain well below harmful thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="BlueskyEmbed" data-react-props='{"uri":"at://did:plc:746sksvmlwppi6zda5c7rtzb/app.bsky.feed.post/3lgubaqofoj2l"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is changing? How much can I buy?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGA’s decision to tighten rules about vitamin B6 products responds to a worrying number of peripheral neuropathy cases in Australia, linked to various vitamin supplements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tighter measures will come into effect on June 1 2027. The changes &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/stronger-safety-controls-be-introduced-products-containing-vitamin-b6"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  pharmacist supervision for purchase of products containing more than 50mg but less than 200mg of B6 per recommended daily dose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  prescriptions required for products with more than 200mg of B6 per recommended daily dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the products now requiring prescriptions or pharmacist supervision have around 19–117 times the recommended intake. Products with 50mg per recommended daily dose or less will still be available over-the-counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of B6 which might cause toxicity is not fully known, as it seems to vary across the population. Some &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557436/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have identified nerve damage in people taking less than 500mg/day, but not below 200mg/day. So this is likely why the TGA chose these limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Combining products increases your risk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new regulations are likely to affect specific standalone B6 products, which tend to have the highest doses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But B6 is commonly also added to &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/safety/safety-monitoring-and-information/safety-alerts/health-supplements-containing-vitamin-b6-can-cause-peripheral-neuropathy"&gt;multivitamins&lt;/a&gt;, “ageing support” supplements, skin and hair support products, and effervescent products &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/1101296/vitamin-and-mineral-supplementation.pdf"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt; Berocca. Most of these contain less than 50mg in the daily recommended dose, and so will continue to be available over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are unaware how much vitamin B6 they are consuming, often across multiple supplements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely the combination of these products that leads to people unknowingly consuming significant enough doses to cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Changes to labelling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TGA’s report &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-11/notice-final-decision-to-amend-current-poisons-standard-pyridoxine-pyridoxa-pyridoxamine-vitamin-b6.pdf"&gt;also acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; the need for clearer labelling, including mandatory front-of-pack statements that indicate when a product contains vitamin B6 – especially in combination products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the 125 medicines containing more than 50mg and less than 200mg per recommended daily dose of vitamin B6 are currently listed as complementary medicines. They will need to be registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and relabelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the report says the TGA may decide to introduce further packaging changes, including strengthening warning statements and change how vitamin B6 is labelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take vitamin supplements of any kind, check the label to ensure you are not exceeding the recommendations (50mg/day is more than adequate) across all your supplements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, ask your pharmacist for advice. If you’re worried you’ve taken too much vitamin B6, see a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A build-up of sticky proteins in the brain is a key hallmark of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, thought to be closely linked to the disease's progression. Now scientists have found a new way to clear these harmful clumps in the brains of mice and the eyes of fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This potentially promising  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; treatment involves an oral dose of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arginine"&gt;arginine&lt;/a&gt;, an amino acid already used as a medication for conditions including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-may-now-have-hypertension"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery was made by a team from Kindai University and Japan's National Institute of Neuroscience, who focused on the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;amyloid-beta plaques&lt;/a&gt; seen in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the same results can be achieved in human brains, we may have another avenue for potentially tackling a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;key molecular symptom&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's – in a safe and easily applied way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-now-know-why-alzheimers-erases-memories-of-our-loved-ones"&gt;We May Now Know Why Alzheimer's Erases Memories of Our Loved Ones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates that arginine can suppress amyloid-beta aggregation both in vitro and in vivo," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Yoshitaka Nagai, from Kindai University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What makes this finding exciting is that arginine is already known to be clinically safe and inexpensive, making it a highly promising candidate for repositioning as a therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182892" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182892" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel.jpg" alt="Fly model diagram" class="wp-image-182892 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/FlyModel-600x477.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182892" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Arginine reduced amyloid-beta clumping (in green) in fruit fly models. (Fujii et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurochem. Int.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers bred male mice with Alzheimer's-like aggregations of amyloid-beta, then added arginine to the animals' drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arginine significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-new-compound-reverses-alzheimers-symptoms-in-rats"&gt;reduced the protein build-up&lt;/a&gt; in the animals' brains and alleviated some of the related toxic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice given arginine also showed reduced behavioral abnormalities during tests and had less active neuroinflammatory genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the treatment may not be just scrubbing away the protein plaques; it could be reversing some of the harm being done to the brain, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments in fruit flies and test tubes added to the evidence that arginine could possibly clear out amyloid-beta clumps and stop them from forming in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists already knew that arginine can act as a kind of chemical chaperone, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa115"&gt;preventing the abnormal misfolding&lt;/a&gt; and clumping of proteins, like those seen in Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies also show arginine can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0305318"&gt;cross the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;, which is key for treating brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer's and potentially other related disorders," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nagai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves here, it's important to note that the researchers used a relatively high dose of arginine in their animal tests, and more work needs to be done to figure out a safe treatment dose for humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while mouse and fruit fly models are often good substitutes for human diseases, there's no guarantee that these findings are going to carry over. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/animal-testing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73085" data-postid="182889" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;animal testing&lt;/a&gt; has produced encouraging results, and clinical trials can now be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-of-our-biggest-hopes-for-alzheimers-treatment-doesnt-seem-to-work"&gt;remains some uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; that clearing away amyloid-beta plaques can actually work as a way of treating Alzheimer's. These clumps are definitely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-where-alzheimer-s-plaques-might-really-come-from"&gt;harmful to neurons&lt;/a&gt;, but it's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-test-accurately-predicts-alzheimers-years-ahead-of-first-symptoms"&gt;still unclear&lt;/a&gt; whether they're helping to drive Alzheimer's to begin with, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;signs of other mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxic-tiny-rna-molecules-identified-as-culprit-in-alzheimers-neuron-death"&gt;at work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with those caveats though, it's another encouraging step forward in our understanding of how Alzheimer's works and how we might be able to tackle it – another promising treatment option to add &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer-drugs-show-alzheimers-promise-in-mice"&gt;to an ever-growing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open up new possibilities for developing arginine-based strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1106825"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Nagai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuint.2025.106082"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for millions of adults with age-related macular degeneration, that crucial, central field of sight is blurred beyond recognition. &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/promising-new-treatments-amd"&gt;Current treatments&lt;/a&gt; can only slow its progression or augment vision, but the blur will usually continue to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; of a treatment based on  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; transplants has found the procedure may be able to safely reverse the cumulative damage to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-fruit-could-reduce-chances-of-eye-disease-macular-degeneration"&gt;hard-working macula&lt;/a&gt; – that part of the retina &lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;responsible for all you see directly in front of you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gold-injections-in-the-eye-may-be-the-future-of-vision-preservation"&gt;Gold Injections in The Eye May Be The Future of Vision Preservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the first time this particular stem cell treatment has been tested in humans, and as a phase 1/2a clinical trial, the main focus of the investigation was safety and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of the treatment compared with existing therapies won't be known until at least the end of phase 3, but the preliminary results were positive enough that trials are proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier testing in the lab showed the transplant process was safe enough to proceed with in-human trials: the transplanted  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="183000" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; retained their retinal identity, and no tumours or toxicity were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening 18 potentially eligible patients, the researchers enrolled six volunteers aged 71 to 86 who had been diagnosed with dry age-related macular degeneration (&lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration"&gt;the most common type, making up around 80 percent of all macular degeneration cases&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the participants had worse vision in general, with visual acuity scores ranging from 20/200 to 20/800 (which means they could only see the first, biggest letter on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart"&gt;Snellen chart&lt;/a&gt;, at best). The other three had scores between 20/70 and 20/200.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the less common and more rapid 'wet' macular degeneration, the 'dry' form of the condition is a gradual loss of vision caused by tiny deposits of fats and proteins destroying the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_pigment_epithelium"&gt;retinal pigment epithelial cells&lt;/a&gt; (RPEs) that support the eye's light-sensitive tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183119" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642.jpg" alt="diagram of macular degeneration" class="wp-image-183119 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/MD_of_the_eye_diagram2_642-600x280.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183119" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram showing early stages of dry macular degeneration, caused by deposits of fats and proteins known as drusen beneath the RPE.

The cells were inserted under the retina of the superior temporal macula in the patients' most-impaired eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the trial showed the treatment is safe, with no sign of the immune problems or tumors that &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-stem-cell-test-may-reduce-tumour-risk-14932"&gt;can sometimes arise&lt;/a&gt; in stem cell transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No adverse events were related to the stem cells themselves, though there were a few of the typical complications seen in this kind of eye surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, each patient experienced an improvement in vision in the eye that received the transplant that was not apparent in the other, suggesting the stem cells were doing exactly what scientists had hoped they would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year after the treatment, the three participants who had the worst vision were able to see an average of 21 more letters on an eye chart than they had at the start of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although we were pleased with the safety data, the exciting part was that their vision was also improving," &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/adult-stem-cells-show-therapeutic-promise-treating-vision-loss-macular-degeneration"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Rajesh Rao, a physician-scientist and ophthalmologist at Michigan Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised by the magnitude of vision gain in the most severely affected patients who received the adult stem cell-derived RPE transplants. This level of vision gain has not been seen in this group of patients with advanced dry AMD."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is continuing to monitor patients who received higher doses (150,000 and 250,000 cells). If those doses are also deemed safe, it will help determine whether Rao and team can scale up human testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2025.08.012"&gt;Cell Stem Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"The three new cases are all unvaccinated Wasatch County high school students."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department suspects that people inside the high school during its normal hours may have been exposed to the virus on Nov. 14, 17 and 18, and at a school play on Nov. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A letter with notification and guidance was sent to Wasatch High School families to inform them of the situation," a press release issued by the health department reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonelle Fitzgerald, the health department's director, said a wastewater test taken on Nov. 6 showed the presence of the virus within the community, "and with cases existing in other parts of the state, we weren't surprised to see cases here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent rise in cases in Wasatch County comes as the state's total number of cases hits triple digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; data dashboard shows 102 measles infections across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southwest Utah Health District leads the state's infections with 74 measles cases, followed by Utah County, with nine cases, and Wasatch County's eight infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four people have been diagnosed with measles over the last three weeks, the dashboard reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a major holiday marks a time for gatherings among family and loved ones, health officials warn that measles is highly contagious and spreads easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms, which typically appear within one to three weeks after exposure, can include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that starts on the face and spreads downward&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wasatch County Health Department said it advises anyone experiencing symptoms to call their health care provider immediately, especially those who are unvaccinated or who have been exposed to a known case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials encourage residents to get both doses of the MMR vaccine, as they say it is 97% effective in preventing the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drinking a maximum of 3-4 cups of coffee a day may slow the 'biological' aging of people with severe mental illness, by lengthening their telomeres-indicators of cellular -and giving them the equivalent of 5 extra biological years, compared with non-coffee drinkers, finds research published in the open access journal &lt;em&gt;BMJ Mental Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no such effects were observed beyond this quota, which is the maximum daily intake recommended by several international health authorities, including the NHS and the US Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telomeres sit on the end of chromosomes and perform a role similar to the plastic tips on the end of shoelaces. While telomere shortening is a natural part of the process, it seems to be accelerated in those with major psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, note the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are sensitive to environmental factors, including, possibly, diet. And coffee, when drunk in moderation, has been associated with various health benefits, prompting the researchers to explore whether it might influence the rate at which telomeres shorten in people with major mental ill health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They included 436 adult participants from the Norwegian Thematically Organised Psychosis (TOP) study, recruited between 2007 and 2018: 259 had schizophrenia; the rest (177) had affective disorders, including bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked how much coffee they drank every day and were grouped into 4 categories: zero (44); 1–2 cups; 3–4 cups (110); and 5 or more cups. And they were asked whether they smoked, and if so, for how long they had done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who drank 5+ cups a day were significantly older than those who drank none or 1–2 cups a day. And those with schizophrenia drank significantly more coffee than those with an affective disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking is associated with faster caffeine metabolism. And around three quarters of participants (77%; 337) smoked, and had done so, on average, for 9 years. And those drinking 5+ cups a day had smoked for significantly longer than any of the other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Telomere length was measured from white blood cells (leucocytes) extracted from blood samples, and this revealed a significant difference among the 4 groups, forming a J shaped curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with those drinking no coffee, drinking up to 3–4 cups a day was associated with longer telomeres, but not in those participants drinking 5 or more every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those participants getting a daily 4-cup caffeine hit had telomere lengths comparable to a biological age 5 years younger than that of non-coffee drinkers after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, tobacco use, type of mental ill health, and drug treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and, as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that they had no information on potentially influential factors, including the type and timing of the coffee consumed, actual caffeine levels, or other sources of caffeinated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are plausible biological explanations for their findings, they suggest. These include the powerful antioxidant and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-Inflammation-Do-to-the-Body.aspx#3" class="linked-term"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; compounds found in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Telomeres are highly sensitive to both oxidative stress and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-Inflammation-Do-to-the-Body.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, further highlighting how coffee intake could help preserve cellular in a population whose pathophysiology may be predisposing them to an accelerated rate of&lt;/em&gt; ," they explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee is popular worldwide, with an estimated 10.56 billion kilos consumed around the globe in 2021-2 alone, they point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite its potential benefits, "consuming more than the daily recommended amount of coffee may also cause cellular damage and [telomere] shortening through the formation of reactive oxygen species," they caution, emphasising that international health authorities recommend limiting caffeine intake to a maximum of 400 mg/day (4 cups of coffee).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-leaderboard-320"&gt;

(KFSN) -- &lt;/span&gt;The holidays and flu season are upon us, and medical professionals are warning people of a new version of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Subclade K is a variant of the common flu strain that we are typically seeing this year. It's known to be a little more aggressive and a little bit more infectious, but it has the same effects and same symptoms as your regular flu strain," says Dr. Emanuele Maccalli, who is the Medical Director of inpatient Pediatrics at Kaweah Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Symptoms include fever, aches and muscle pains. You can also have a runny nose, cough, sore throat, and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have already shown an increase in hospitalizations, particularly in populations such as children under the age of five, and the elderly do seem to be hospitalized at higher rates even compared to last year, which was a very severe year," explains Dr. Maccalli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While it's just taking hold here, this new flu variant has already run rampant overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"In other countries, it has already been declared an epidemic. Here in the US, we still don't know how it is going to be presented. It may cause some similar issues here in our country. But yes, this new subclade variant may be associated with more, higher transmission, with higher problems, with higher symptoms," explains Dr. Saul Diaz Martinez, with Pediatrics at Adventist Health Hospital Fowler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors say the current flu shot does offer some protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The key is prevention, such as washing your hands and staying away from others if you feel sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It's especially important to keep an eye on vulnerable populations, especially children under five, who are at higher risk of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I always encourage my parents to trust their parental instincts. If your child is not doing well, then bring them in to get checked out," urges Dr. Maccalli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Also, if over-the-counter medications are not working, it is important to know when to seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Debilitating symptoms, difficulty feeding, refusing liquids or decreased urinary output. It may be that there is something more serious going on, such as pneumonia or other complications for influenza, and they need to be seen right away," mentions Dr. Diaz Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors remind us that the flu is a serious virus that can have permanent consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This can be life-threatening.

                Dr. Ralph Abraham spoke at a Trump re-election rally in Lake Charles, La., on Oct. 11, 2019. At the time, Abraham was a Republican congressman running for governor of Louisiana. He lost that race, but was named the state's first surgeon general in 2024.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The second-highest ranking official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be Dr. Ralph Abraham, the head of Louisiana's health department.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He has questioned the safety of the COVID vaccine and forbidden his department from promoting vaccines to the public.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Abraham will join the agency as principal deputy director, according to an official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who was not authorized to speak to the media about a personnel matter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A former Republican congressman and a physician with a practice in Richland Parish, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/office-of-the-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;Abraham&lt;/a&gt; has been a vocal supporter of Health Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/robert-kennedy.html" target="_blank"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, and shares some of his views on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Abraham, 71, has called COVID vaccines "&lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1966237494627983445" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt;." During a Sept. 2024 state legislative meeting, Abraham said he would support investigating the debunked link between &lt;a href="https://www.healthcarejournalbr.com/journal/november-december-2024" target="_blank"&gt;vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The position has been vacant since &lt;a href="https://farmington.edu/about/news/umf-proudly-announces-dr-nirav-dinesh-shah-former-principal-deputy-director-of-the-u-s-cdc-as-the-2025-umf-commencement-speaker/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah&lt;/a&gt;, who served under the Biden administration, stepped down in February.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shah called Abraham's appointment "atrocious."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, led by Kennedy. The CDC's current acting director is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5522036/cdc-rfk-hhs-monarez-jim-oneill-leadership" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;, who most recently worked as an investor.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because neither Kennedy nor O'Neill is a doctor or scientist, Abraham's medical degree is useful to help further their views, Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"With the addition of Dr. Abraham, they now have a scientific gloss that they can put on their anti-vaccine theories," Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He gives Secretary Kennedy some scientific and medical cover for their odious and unscientific beliefs," he added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Abraham was named Louisiana's first Surgeon General in 2024, under Republican Governor &lt;a href="https://gov.louisiana.gov/page/meet-the-governor" target="_blank"&gt;Jeff Landry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon after, Abraham moved to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/20/nx-s1-5223440/louisiana-ban-public-health-promoting-covid-flu-mpox-vaccines-landry-rfk-jr-anti-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;ban the promotion of COVID, flu and mpox vaccines&lt;/a&gt; by the state health department. He then &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-02-17/louisiana-medical-organizations-criticize-states-ban-on-vaccine-promotion" target="_blank"&gt;banned all vaccine promotion and events&lt;/a&gt; by the health department in February, hours after Kennedy was confirmed as health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, cases of whooping cough in Louisiana began to climb, eventually growing to &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/232491" target="_blank"&gt;387 cases&lt;/a&gt;, the worst outbreak of whooping cough in the state in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Early in the outbreak, two infants died from the disease. Infants are not eligible for their first pertussis vaccine until they're &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;2 months old&lt;/a&gt;, but they can acquire immunity if their mother was immunized while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After the infant deaths, Abraham's health department &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths" target="_blank"&gt;waited three months&lt;/a&gt; before issuing an official alert to physicians and warning the public in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Dr. Abraham's record shows that when an emergency in public health materializes, his instinct is to sweep it under the rug," Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the event of the next pandemic, "that could mean the difference between controlling a major outbreak versus letting it fester and explode," he added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The principal deputy director is the second in command at the CDC, said &lt;a href="https://www.ncicp.org/staff-member/anne-schuchat-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Anne Schuchat&lt;/a&gt;, who worked there for 33 years, including as principal deputy director from 2015 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most appointees are CDC employees who've worked at the agency for many years, and have experience in crisis management and emergency response to public health threats, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Responsibilities can run from overseeing every aspect of CDC's work within the U.S., to coordinating emergency responses to outbreaks around the world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schuchat called Abraham's appointment "scary."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This appears to be one more step away from health and towards danger," Schuchat said. "We know that vaccinations are saving lives and protecting health and preventing outbreaks, and ideology should not outweigh the evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the Louisiana legislature, Abraham supported bills to &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/politics/2025-04-23/bill-banning-fluoride-in-louisianas-public-water-systems-clears-senate-committee" target="_blank"&gt;ban fluoride in public water systems&lt;/a&gt;, and to expand access to &lt;a href="https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/2025/04/30/louisiana-surgeon-general-recommends-ivermectin-as-covid-for-his-patients-and-backs-deregulation/83362570007/" target="_blank"&gt;ivermectin to treat COVID&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/30/1089809588/ivermectin-covid-treatment-brazil-study" target="_blank"&gt;evidence that it is not effective against COVID&lt;/a&gt;. The fluoride bill failed, but the ivermectin bill passed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Picking Abraham for this position was an "irresponsible choice," said &lt;a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/lawrence-o-gostin/" target="_blank"&gt;Lawrence Gostin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Dr. Abraham has little trust in science and he is likely to further erode the credibility of the CDC," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;HHS has not said when Abraham will start his new role.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WWNO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Progress in cutting the global toll of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183081" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; remains painfully slow, but a new blood test has sparked unusual levels of hope. Researchers say it could one day make routine screening far more effective by catching cancers earlier, when treatment has the best chance of saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Galleri blood test, developed by US firm Grail, is the latest entrant to attract worldwide attention, after early trial results were described as "exciting" by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://grail.com/press-releases/grail-pathfinder-2-results-show-galleri-multi-cancer-early-detection-blood-test-increased-cancer-detection-more-than-seven-fold-when-added-to-uspstf-a-and-b-recommended-screenings/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; claims the test, currently being trialled by the NHS, can detect signals from 50 cancers and correctly identify the disease in 62 per cent of people who receive a positive result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-7-warning-signs-of-brain-cancer-you-might-easily-miss"&gt;The 7 Warning Signs of Brain Cancer You Might Easily Miss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also appears to be highly accurate at ruling cancer out, with a reported 99.6 percent success rate among those who were disease-free. At first glance, these headline figures appear to represent a significant step forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before we reach for the champagne, it's worth looking more closely at what these numbers really mean. Early promise does not always translate into real-world performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183094" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642.jpg" alt="cancer cells illustration" class="wp-image-183094 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/cancer_cell_illo_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183094" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;New cancer blood test aims to identify cancers of varying types. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGv7Q2bTYc/"&gt;ninjadesign/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pathfinder 2 trial, involving 23,161 people aged over 50 from the US and Canada with no prior cancer diagnosis, produced the figures now circulating widely. Of the 216 participants who tested positive, 133 were later found to have cancer, giving the "positive predictive value" (PPV) of 62 percent that has been &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c205g21n1zzo"&gt;so&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/11/05/galleri-early-cancer-detection-blood-test/87009742007/"&gt;widely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/18/cancer-blood-test-seven-times-more-effective-than-current/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That metric answers a crucial question: "If I test positive, what's the chance I actually have cancer?" It also means, however, that 38 percent of positive results were false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specificity – how often a test avoids falsely diagnosing cancer – is equally important, given the anxiety and medical follow-up triggered by an incorrect result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, the test performed well: 99.6 percent of people without cancer received a correct negative result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet even this strong number has implications. If everyone aged over 50 in the UK were tested – more than 26 million people – the same rate would still generate over 100,000 false positives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has been less widely discussed is sensitivity, the measure of how many true cancer cases the test actually detects. On this measure, the result was 40.4 percent, meaning the test missed around three in every five cancers that appeared over the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galleri test results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A chart showing how many cancer cases the Galleri test would correctly identify." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=511&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/704517/original/file-20251125-56-27chsg.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=642&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Galleri cancer test in numbers. (John Ferguson, &lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The figure that's been less widely reported&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shortfall may disappoint those hoping for a catch-all screening tool. It also raises the risk that patients could be falsely reassured by a negative result, potentially delaying a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statisticians caution that the reported PPV, specificity, and sensitivity are estimates rather than fixed values, and each comes with uncertainty. They also note that tests often perform less well outside carefully controlled trials, meaning real-world accuracy could be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does this leave the Galleri test? It may well become a useful addition to future screening programmes, provided that negative results are not viewed as definitive by patients or doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the low sensitivity means many cancers would still be missed in its current form. The test is also expensive – US$949 (£723) in the US – and no evidence yet shows that widely using it reduces cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early data is encouraging, but perhaps the excitement deserves to be tempered. This technology may be a step forward, but it is not a solution on its own.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270438/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Recent data reveals that in SCPHD's eight-county region, which includes Blaine, Camas, Cassia, Gooding, Jerome, Lincoln, Minidoka, and Twin Falls, new HIV and AIDS cases in 2025 have already surpassed the total numbers from 2024. Specifically, HIV cases have tripled from five in 2024 to 15 in 2025, while AIDS cases have increased from one to nine in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCPHD is urging residents to mitigate their risk by using condoms and seeking timely HIV and STI testing after sexual contact with new partners. "HIV is now a manageable condition with proper treatment; however, cases that are undiagnosed or go untreated remain a serious concern," said Jacob Ward, SCPHD epidemiologist. He emphasized the importance of early testing and consistent treatment to protect long-term health, noting that untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, severely weakening the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In observance of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, SCPHD will offer free HIV screenings at its Twin Falls and Jerome locations on select days in December. Residents can walk in for testing at the Twin Falls Office on Thursday, Dec. 4, and at the Jerome Office on Tuesday, Dec. 9, between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. Spanish-speaking services will be available at both locations. Idahonews.com has reached out to Southwest District Health, which covers the Boise area, to determine how many cases have been reported. We will update this story as we learn more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KBOI</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 23:45:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQY1BsREtLeDRPNHplX19uaHBVcHJKTkpJMXFnWkpSc3pIUVR2LUdPREhSSU1HZE12TnZtUkFVV0QxZGl5WlctbkVVWFVlLUFZZzhtMndCYVhiRHNlXzRvNmxvQ2VEWHZaQ0dqN1ZISjhIV2xmdVNWVTJaM2FMajVWZnhjVGs4LXhkV2xma0htTzRFYVIwdEhMUnNjc015dkRpUlp3ZQ</guid></item><item><title>每天喝咖啡可能会减缓严重精神疾病患者的生物学衰老- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-11-daily-coffee-biological-aging-people.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

It is familiar, versatile and woven into so many everyday meals, whether it is paneer in a curry, cheddar in a sandwich or mozzarella on a Friday night pizza. Most of us think about cheese in terms of flavour and convenience, not long term health. Yet researchers have begun looking at whether small dietary choices, such as how often you eat cheese, might relate to your future brain health. The idea sounds almost too simple, but sometimes lifestyle habits that seem insignificant can form quiet patterns over time. As conversations around dementia risk grow, even a food as ordinary as cheese has found its way into scientific discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major peer reviewed study titled&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/21/3363" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cheese Consumption and Incidence of Dementia in Community Dwelling Older Japanese Adults: The JAGES 2019–2022 Cohort Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; followed more than 7,900 adults aged 65 and older for three years and found that weekly cheese consumption was linked with a lower incidence of dementia. This does not mean cheese prevents dementia, but the association is strong enough to merit attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sleepless in middle age: A risky link to dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How your weekly cheese consumption may be linked to lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study compared adults who ate cheese at least once a week with those who did not eat cheese at all. Among weekly cheese eaters, around 3.4 per cent developed dementia during the follow-up period, compared with about 4.5 per cent in non-cheese eaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After accounting for factors such as age, income, physical activity and existing health conditions, the cheese eating group still showed a hazard ratio of 0.76, which translates to roughly a 24 per cent relative reduction in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absolute difference remains small, but when viewed at a population level, especially in countries where cheese is not regularly consumed, even small nutritional habits may add up. The study’s strength lies in its large sample size and careful adjustment of lifestyle factors, which helps rule out some of the common confounders that often appear in nutrition research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research says about &lt;keyword id="31003993" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="cheese-consumption-and-dementia-risk" source="keywords"&gt;cheese consumption and dementia risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not prove a direct cause, it offered several theories for why cheese might be linked with better cognitive outcomes. Cheese contains high-quality proteins, essential fatty acids and vitamin K2, all of which support vascular and neurological health. Since the health of blood vessels is closely tied to cognitive function, foods that promote vascular wellbeing could indirectly influence dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory relates to the gut microbiome. Many cheeses, particularly fermented varieties, contain beneficial bacterial cultures and bioactive peptides that may support a healthier gut environment. Research over recent years has shown a strong connection between gut health and the ageing brain, although this particular study did not differentiate types of cheese. Still, the idea that fermented dairy foods can influence long-term cognitive outcomes has become an active area of scientific interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also possible that people who eat cheese tend to have more diverse or nutrient-rich diets overall. The study found that non-cheese eaters often had generally poorer dietary patterns. Therefore, cheese consumption might act as a marker for a healthier eating style rather than being the single protective factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why cheese might support brain health according to emerging science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the nutrient profile, researchers believe cheese may align with dietary patterns that support better brain ageing. Diets rich in whole foods, moderate in healthy fats and balanced in protein are often associated with reduced dementia risk. When cheese is consumed in moderation, it can contribute to this balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese also provides satiety, which may indirectly improve diet quality by limiting excessive snacking or reducing reliance on highly processed foods. While this is not explicitly measured in the study, nutritional habits tend to work as a network of behaviours rather than isolated choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to understand the limits of the evidence. The study did not measure biomarkers or track the effects of different cheese varieties. Nor did it explore portion sizes, meaning the results apply only to frequency, not quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can your own diet take from the cheese and dementia risk findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings do not suggest that increasing cheese intake alone will meaningfully change your dementia risk. Instead, they highlight the value of a well-rounded diet where cheese can play a part. Eating cheese once or twice a week fits comfortably within most healthy eating patterns, especially when combined with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and omega-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy cheese already, the research offers a gentle reassurance that your weekly habit may align with positive long-term patterns. If you avoid dairy because of intolerance or preference, there is no need to add cheese solely for brain health. Plenty of foods such as leafy greens, berries, legumes and oily fish also support cognitive wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study means for long term brain health and everyday eating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection between cheese consumption and dementia risk adds a thoughtful angle to our understanding of diet and ageing. It is an association, not a prescription, but it invites a broader discussion about the small consistent choices that support brain health across decades. Cheese can be part of this picture, but it remains just one element among sleep, exercise, social engagement, mental stimulation and overall diet quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, the study reminds us that brain health is shaped by a mosaic of everyday habits. Your weekly cheese habit might be one of them, offering not a magic solution but a small, meaningful piece of the larger puzzle of healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Of the 308 who benefited from tirzepatide, 254 (82 percent) regained at least 25 percent of the weight they had lost on the drug by week 88. Further, 177 (57 percent) regained at least 50 percent, and 74 (24 percent) regained at least 75 percent. Generally, the more weight people regained, the more their cardiovascular and metabolic health improvements reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data gaps and potential off-ramps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there were 54 participants of the 308 (17.5 percent) that didn’t regain a significant amount of weight (less than 25 percent.) This group saw some of their health metrics worsen on withdrawal of the drug, but not all— blood pressure increased a bit, but cholesterol didn’t go up significantly overall. About a dozen participants (4 percent of the 308) continued to lose weight after stopping the drug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers couldn’t figure out why these 54 participants fared so well; there were “no apparent differences” in demographic or clinical characteristics, they reported. It’s clear the topic requires further study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, overall, the study offers a gloomy outlook for patients hoping to avoid needing to take anti-obesity drugs for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oczypok and Anderson highlight that the study involved an abrupt withdrawal from the drug. In contrast, many patients may be interested in slowly weaning off the drugs, stepping down dosage levels over time. So far, data on this strategy and the protocols to pull it off have little data behind them. It also might not be an option for patients who abruptly lose access or insurance coverage of the drugs. Other strategies for weaning off the drugs could involve ramping up physical activity or calorie restriction in anticipation of dropping the drugs, the experts note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to more data on potential GLP-1 off-ramps, the pair calls for more data on the effects of weight fluctuations from people going on and off the treatment. At least one study has found that the regained weight after intentional weight loss may end up being proportionally higher in fat mass, which could be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Oczypok and Anderson say doctors should be cautious about talking with patients about these drugs and what the future could hold. “These results add to the body of evidence that clinicians and patients should approach starting [anti-obesity medications] as long-term therapies, just as they would medications for other chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;

Before 2025, Kentucky had last recorded an infant whooping cough death in 2018.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chfs.ky.gov/News/Documents/Third%2520Infant%2520Pertussis%2520Death%2520Reported%2520in%2520Kentucky%2520in%252012%2520Months.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;State officials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Kentucky is seeing the most pertussis activity since 2012 and expects more in the coming weeks. So far this year, Kentucky has reported at least 566 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many illnesses can be prevented through vaccination, which helps protect not only the individual but also those around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are deeply saddened to learn of another infant death in Kentucky due to pertussis and are concerned by the volume of cases we are seeing throughout the commonwealth,”&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Steven Stack, MD, the state secretary of Kentucky’s Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said in a statement. “We continue to urge Kentuckians to get their whooping cough vaccine and to make sure they are up to date on all other recommended immunizations. Many illnesses can be prevented through vaccination, which helps protect not only the individual but also those around them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numbers surge post-pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, there are more than 25,000 cases of whooping cough reported so far in 2025, according to a new report from&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/25000-cases-whooping-cough-recorded-year-higher-pre/story?id=127831021"&gt;&lt;u&gt; ABC news&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, more than 33,000 cases were reported by November. Pertussis cases had dropped significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, 18,600 whooping cough cases were reported nationwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), however, says that many cases go unrecognized and unreported.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reported cases of pertussis have been trending down since a peak in November 2024. However, preliminary case report numbers remain elevated in 2025 compared to immediately before the pandemic,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the CDC said.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox4news.com/news/whooping-cough-cases-rise-texas"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas has reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the most whooping cough activity this year, with at least 3,500 cases so far in 2025, and two associated deaths among infants. Both Louisiana and Washington state also reported high activity at the beginning of the year.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say falling vaccination rates seen during the pandemic are likely the reason for the increased activity. &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/whooping-cough/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Infants at 2 months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of age and older should receive their initial vaccine (in a series of five) against pertussis, as should pregnant women and infant caregivers.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;An 11-year-old boy in England died in front of his mother and grandmother at home ... just hours after complaining to his doctor about a sore throat and being told it was nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frankie-Rae Law&lt;/strong&gt; went to see a doctor on Nov. 14 in England, but he was told his sore throat was "just a virus," and he was sent home and died ... according to the South West News Service.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The boy's mother, &lt;strong&gt;Keleigh Law&lt;/strong&gt;, says her son's condition got worse in a hurry later that night ... she says he was laughing and playing around like usual when all of a sudden, he started having trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Keleigh says her son came to the living room, gasping for air, and his face expressed "absolute sheer horror." She says they went to the bathroom, and within moments, he was unconscious, slumped over the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;She says his lips were gray, and his eyes were glazed ... and his grandma performed CPR for 30 minutes, but he only opened his eyes for a couple of seconds and spat up some saliva before knocking out again.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Keleigh called paramedics, and her son was rushed to a hospital, where doctors put him on a ventilator and told her the chance of survival was "very thin." She says she was told he would have brain damage if he survived, and she ultimately pulled the plug.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Frankie-Rae's cause of death is unclear ... his mom says she has no clue what was wrong with him and feels like she "failed him."&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

Abraham’s appointment was confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/25/cdc-new-deputy-vaccine-ralph-abraham/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;to the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; by an HHS spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Abraham’s appointment is certain to cause renewed anxiety among health experts as rifts deepen over US vaccine policy under the leadership of the health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, who is reconstituting leadership at US federal health agencies in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/cdc-director-susan-monarez-key-takeaways" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;prioritize vaccine skepticism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d8a3fe59-44f3-4c13-909d-91902064b7dc" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"RFK Jr’s anti-vaccine fight and US fear for public health: key moments from ousted CDC director’s testimony","elementId":"d8a3fe59-44f3-4c13-909d-91902064b7dc","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/cdc-director-susan-monarez-key-takeaways"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As Louisiana’s surgeon general since 2024, Abraham drew criticism for directing state health agencies to stop promoting mass vaccination as a public health strategy, and for criticizing “blanket government mandates” for immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earlier this year, Abraham wrote that “missteps” during the Covid-19 pandemic had caused a loss of trust in government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Government should admit the limitations of its role in people’s lives and pull back its tentacles from the practice of medicine,” &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/7478" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;, adding that “restoring this trust requires returning medical decisions to the doctor-patient relationship, where informed, personalized care is guided by compassion and expertise rather than blanket government mandates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Notably, after Abraham left a congressional seat he had held from 2015 to 2021, his elected successor was his chief of staff, Luke Letlow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Letlow, who received Abraham’s support while running for Congress, then died from Covid-19 in December 2020 – days before he was due to be sworn in – at a time when protective vaccines against the virus were not widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Letlow’s widow, Julia Letlow, was subsequently elected to her late husband’s seat, with constituents who live in an area with a history of generally low vaccination rates. In April 2021, Julia Letlow told CBS News: “I would’ve given anything – I would’ve given everything – for that shot to be available for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Looking back now, and for someone to turn it away, it’s heartbreaking to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC currently has no permanent director following the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ousting of Susan Monarez&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. The HHS deputy secretary, Jim O’Neill, is serving as acting CDC director, making Abraham effectively No 1 at the institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The agency, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, was rocked when a gunman &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/atlanta-cdc-shooting" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;opened fire&lt;/a&gt; there. One of the suspect’s neighbors &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/08/active-shooter-reported-on-emory-university-campus/?postId-9997223" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/a&gt;: “He very deeply believed that vaccines hurt him and were hurting other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Abraham’s elevation adds to the vaccine skeptics working at the CDC under Kennedy, who has previously cut funding to vaccine research programs and purged pro-vaccine members from the CDC’s federal vaccine advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Abraham’s position on vaccines has previously brought him into conflict with the Louisiana US senator Bill Cassidy, a pro-vaccination physician, when Abraham &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-vaccination-surgeon-general-8e2eecde047648e6fb62c4b44edd6566" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;canceled the state’s mass&lt;/a&gt; vaccination program. The state is now in the midst of its worst &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whooping cough outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nonetheless, on the same day that Abraham canceled Louisiana’s mass vaccination program, Cassidy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/16/louisiana-vaccines-rfk-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;voted to confirm&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy as HHS secretary. And Kennedy has now appointed Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Asked by CNN last weekend if Kennedy’s vaccine positions could cause harm to Americans, the senator responded that “anything that undermines the understanding, the correct understanding, the absolute scientifically based understanding that vaccines are safe and that, if you don’t take them, you’re putting your child or yourself in greater danger, anything that undermines that message is a problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 21:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNZi0zTlhMcXhOcXlLUTc0REU5bFVnWGo5MzZGZmQwYktEdm5rUm1wUnpYRUJWLXlYcUFPYWNvUTZwWXRBeHlDcE13VWJkTWlQT0F5WTdkWnFXU3c5azZkcUtnZGJ5TnNjaVBmUl9HUjZfVTZtZnRwUk9wRUFmYkpHRExVbXhvWTlC</guid></item></channel></rss>
