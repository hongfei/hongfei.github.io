She would ask the same question multiple times, be bedbound from migraines and unstable on her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mystery behind her decades-long ailments was seemingly solved when she was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-d8d8b240-47b8-11f0-a1bc-256a2104db0b"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease in June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘We had spent countless hours fretting over what could be wrong, but not once did I think it could be early-onset Alzheimer’s. That diagnosis belongs to other families, I thought. Not ours.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Fischers met with renowned neurologists and prepared the then-61-year-old to participate in an Alzheimer’s clinical trial for the drug varoglutamstat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came devastating news that meant Mrs Fischer wouldn't be eligible for the trial - she was suffering from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-2242332/Cerebrospinal-fluid-leak-Woman-dies-brain-fluid-leak-months-Arizona.html"&gt;a persistent leak of spinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in her spinal system, but doctors couldn't pinpoint the source - and couldn't fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believed it was likely a result of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-9266007/New-mum-lie-flat-stop-excruciating-headaches-C-section-caused-brain-leak.html"&gt;epidurals she'd received during childbirth&lt;/a&gt; - an injection in the back that numbs a person from their belly button to their thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a common pain relief option during childbirth and an estimated 61 percent of women who give birth receive an epidural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After suffering for more than a decade, doctors said a new procedure would allos them to inject &lt;span&gt;dye into Mrs Fischer's spinal fluid to search for the leak - a small spot in the middle of her back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks after they sealed it, all of her symptoms went away and doctors said she didn't actually have Alzheimer's - &lt;/span&gt;the tiny spot in her back was actually the source of all her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer's mother, 61, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after years of worsening memory, severe migraines, balance problems, and nausea. But they had no idea the source of her problems was a fixable spinal fluid leak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Fischer's &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;health battle began&lt;/a&gt; long before her Alzheimer's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It started in spring 2001, when Sean said he received a call from his dad: Mom had pulled over on the highway, vomiting from a sudden, crushing headache. Her doctor called it a migraine, but months later she lost hearing in one ear and was diagnosed with Ménière’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adjusted — avoiding movements that triggered vertigo, wearing a hearing aid in her forties, and taking daily meds for the headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even as she quietly suffered, Sean &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis?utm_source=x&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid-social_&amp;amp;utm_campaign=marketing_evergreen&amp;amp;utm_adgroup=ret&amp;amp;utm_content=alzheimers&amp;amp;utm_adid=1924872245341823240&amp;amp;twclid=275q9y2oonhono4qjy71vk3yuu"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;for The Free Press, she stayed steady for him and his brothers, never missing a soccer game, school musical, or packed lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, neurologists at Columbia University diagnosed her with a Chiari malformation, a structural defect where the brain is pushed through the opening at the base of the skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suspected the malformation was caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak, sparked by her three epidurals from the births of each of her sons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epidurals are extremely safe and are administered by inserting a needle in the space of the lower spine just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It delivers anesthetic medication, which numbs the lower half of the body and blocks pain while allowing the patient to stay awake and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it can occasionally result in a leak if the needle punctures the thin, tough membrane surrounding the spinal cord containing the CSF, called the dura mater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An epidural is a safe, widely used method of pain relief during childbirth, delivered by inserting a needle into the epidural space in the lower spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this happens, some of the fluid that cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord can leak out into surrounding tissues. It can only be patched up surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leak had, over the years, led to a loss in cerebrospinal fluid volume, causing her brain to sink. This can lead to severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, hearing changes, memory problems, and double vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started high school in 2015, and around that time, I began to notice the quiet dislocation of my mom’s mind,’ Sean wrote for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;The Free Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer wrote about his mother's misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's that was really a constellation of symptoms linked to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When we cooked dinner together, she would have trouble following recipes. She’d stare at her calendar for long stretches of time; making sense of it seemed to require more effort than usual. She started to repeat herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By the time I left for college in Rhode Island, the phrase “You already asked me that” had become a common refrain in the house I grew up in, but at first, we blamed her, telling her she needed to pay more attention.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seeing doctors for headaches, hearing, and anxiety, none of whom believed there could be a common origin. Her memory problems were worsening as well, which led to Mr and Mrs Fischer to to turn to NYU Langone Health’s Center for Cognitive Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My mom was tested extensively — and two months later came the diagnosis, with the finality of a punctuation mark. Alzheimer’s. When it hit her that there was no cure, my mom was bedridden for three days,’ Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hope came with the study. But then doctors called the Fischers and informed them that the CSF leak would not allow her to participate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despair took over.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a few weeks later, Mrs Fischer’s doctor called to tell them about recent medical innovations that would allow surgeons to find and fix the leak, allowing her to participate in the drug trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months later, doctors inserted a probe through the femoral artery in Mrs Fischer’s leg, fed it upward toward her spinal system, and sealed the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘Two weeks later, I visited home, and found Mom more alert than she had been in years. There was no absent look in her eyes. As the day went on, I waited for her to start fading—but she was still wide awake at 10 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘After three weeks, her vertigo was gone, and her physical therapist told her she didn’t need treatment anymore, because she no longer had any balance problems. After four weeks, she told us she felt 20 years younger.’&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six weeks, her problems with memory were gone entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And eventually, Mom’s neurologist confirmed: She did not have Alzheimer’s. The surgeons who fixed the leak were shocked. They had never seen a recovery like it,’ Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family later learned that, a year before the procedure, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center had published a newsletter with the subtitle: ‘Physicians Treating Dementia Should Look for Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak—A Treatable Cause of an Otherwise Incurable Condition.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study followed 21 patients with headaches, severe fatigue, and diagnoses of Chiari malformation and dementia; nine were found to have a cerebrospinal fluid leak, and repairing it completely resolved their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Sean’s mother’s case, countless specialists across multiple hospitals treated her symptoms in isolation, overlooking the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they chose not to place blame on any doctor or institution. It was the system that misdiagnosed her, and ultimately, the system that saved her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘More than anything, we feel grateful that a scientific breakthrough came at just the right time; that the real cause of her suffering was found,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles occur despite &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-is-one-of-the-deadliest-and-most-contagious-infectious-diseases-and-one-of-the-most-easily-preventable-224493"&gt;highly effective vaccines being available&lt;/a&gt;, it's easy to conclude that parents who don't vaccinate their children are misguided, selfish or have fallen prey to misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As professors with expertise in &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MPOYrOkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/avi-dor"&gt;health economics&lt;/a&gt;, we argue that the decision not to vaccinate isn't simply about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050926"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt; or hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our view, it involves &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/"&gt;game theory&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematical framework that helps explain how reasonable people can make choices that collectively lead to outcomes that endanger them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory reveals that vaccine hesitancy is not a moral failure, but simply the predictable outcome of a system in which individual and collective incentives aren't properly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Game theory meets vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory examines how people make decisions when their outcomes depend on what others choose. In his research on the topic, &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1994/nash/facts/"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash&lt;/a&gt;, portrayed in the movie &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Beautiful Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showed that in many situations, individually rational choices don't automatically create the best outcome for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination decisions perfectly illustrate this principle. When a parent decides whether to vaccinate their child against measles, for instance, they weigh the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2023.100268"&gt;small risk of vaccine side effects&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-can-ravage-the-immune-system-and-brain-causing-long-term-damage-a-virologist-explains-252354"&gt;risks posed by the disease&lt;/a&gt;. But here's the crucial insight: The risk of disease depends on what other parents decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nearly everyone vaccinates, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22599-herd-immunity"&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt; – essentially, vaccinating enough people – will stop the disease's spread. But once herd immunity is achieved, individual parents may decide that not vaccinating is the less risky option for their kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, because of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.7401134"&gt;fundamental tension&lt;/a&gt; between individual choice and collective welfare, relying solely on individual choice may not achieve public health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A public health messaging poster for the polio vaccine featuring an illustration of a bee with red stripes and text promoting the vaccine's benefits" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 1963 poster featuring Wellbee, the CDC's national symbol of public health, encouraged people to get the polio vaccine. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Polio_vaccine_poster.jpg"&gt;CDC via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes vaccine decisions fundamentally different from most other health decisions. When you decide whether to take medication for high blood pressure, your outcome depends only on your choice. But with vaccines, everyone is connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interconnectedness has played out dramatically in &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/"&gt;Texas, where the largest U.S. measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in a decade originated. As vaccination rates dropped in certain communities, the disease – once declared eliminated in the U.S. – returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One county's vaccination rate &lt;a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/measles-texas-vaccine-vaccination-rates-schools-dfw-fort-worth-dallas/287-1c321c7d-d1ff-4326-ae9b-eec5c9100699"&gt;fell from 96% to 81% over just five years&lt;/a&gt;. Considering that &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines"&gt;about 95% of people in a community&lt;/a&gt; must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, the decline created perfect conditions for the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't coincidence; it's game theory playing out in real time. When vaccination rates are high, not vaccinating seems rational for each individual family, but when enough families make this choice, collective protection collapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The free rider problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic creates what economists call a &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/"&gt;free rider problem&lt;/a&gt;. When vaccination rates are high, an individual might benefit from herd immunity without accepting even the minimal vaccine risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X211053563"&gt;Game theory predicts something surprising&lt;/a&gt;: Even with a hypothetically perfect vaccine – faultless efficacy, zero side effects – voluntary vaccination programs will never achieve 100% coverage. Once coverage is high enough, some rational individuals will always choose to be free riders, benefiting from the herd immunity provided by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when rates drop – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.8952"&gt;as they have, dramatically&lt;/a&gt;, over the past five years – disease models predict exactly what we're seeing: the return of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory reveals another pattern: For highly contagious diseases, vaccination rates tend to decline rapidly following safety concerns, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403823101"&gt;while recovery occurs much more slowly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, too, is a mathematical property of the system because decline and recovery have different incentive structures. When safety concerns arise, many parents get worried at the same time and stop vaccinating, causing vaccination rates to drop quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recovery is slower because it requires both rebuilding trust and overcoming the free rider problem – each parent waits for others to vaccinate first. Small changes in perception can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.7.12.17980"&gt;large shifts in behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1949292"&gt;Media coverage, social networks and health messaging&lt;/a&gt; all influence these perceptions, potentially moving communities toward or away from these critical thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematics also predicts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010437"&gt;how people's decisions about vaccination can cluster&lt;/a&gt;. As parents observe others' choices, local norms develop – so the more parents skip the vaccine in a community, the more others are likely to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theorists refer to the resulting pockets of low vaccine uptake as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2008.0271"&gt;susceptibility clusters&lt;/a&gt;. These clusters allow diseases to persist even when overall vaccination rates appear adequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 95% statewide or national average could mean uniform vaccine coverage, which would prevent outbreaks. Alternatively, it could mean some areas with near-100% coverage and others with dangerously low rates that enable local outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154579" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642.jpg" alt="A masked healthcare worker vaccinating a senior woman " class="wp-image-154579 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642-620x415.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642-600x402.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154579" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;About 95% of people in a community must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. (Prostock-studio/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not a moral failure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this means that the dramatic fall in vaccination rates was predicted by game theory – and therefore more a reflection of system vulnerability than of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10508422.2023.2285750"&gt;moral failure of individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, blaming parents for making selfish choices can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.36959/856/485"&gt;backfire by making them more defensive&lt;/a&gt; and less likely to reconsider their views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more helpful would be approaches that acknowledge the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.19616"&gt;tensions between individual and collective interests&lt;/a&gt; and that work with, rather than against, the mental calculations informing how people make decisions in interconnected systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;People make decisions by balancing individual and collective interests – a calculation that's crucial for how infectious diseases spread.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.08.019"&gt;communities experiencing outbreaks respond differently&lt;/a&gt; to messaging that frames vaccination as a community problem versus messaging that implies moral failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 study of a community with falling vaccination rates, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03843-2"&gt;approaches that acknowledged parents' genuine concerns&lt;/a&gt; while emphasizing the need for community protection made parents 24% more likely to consider vaccinating, while approaches that emphasized personal responsibility or implied selfishness actually decreased their willingness to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirms what game theory predicts: When people feel their decision-making is under moral attack, they often become more entrenched in their positions rather than more open to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better communication strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how people weigh vaccine risks and benefits points to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2024.2361943"&gt;better approaches to communication&lt;/a&gt;. For example, clearly conveying risks can help: The &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/pediatrics-articles/measles-is-still-a-very-dangerous-disease"&gt;1-in-500 death rate from measles&lt;/a&gt; far outweighs the extraordinarily rare serious vaccine side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may sound obvious, but it's often missing from public discussion. Also, different communities need different approaches – high-vaccination areas need help staying on track, while low-vaccination areas need trust rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency matters tremendously. Research shows that when health experts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2022.103534"&gt;give conflicting information or change their message&lt;/a&gt;, people become more suspicious and decide to hold off on vaccines. And dramatic &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-using-fear-to-promote-covid-19-vaccination-and-mask-wearing-could-backfire-153865"&gt;scare tactics about disease can backfire&lt;/a&gt; by pushing people toward extreme positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making vaccination decisions visible within communities – through community discussions and school-level reporting, where possible – can help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.06.006"&gt;establish positive social norms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When parents understand that vaccination protects vulnerable community members, like infants too young for vaccines or people with medical conditions, it helps bridge the gap between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/phe/phaa008"&gt;individual and collective interests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers remain the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-vaccine-safety-and-trust/"&gt;most trusted source of vaccine information&lt;/a&gt;. When providers understand game theory dynamics, they can address parents' concerns more effectively, recognizing that for most people, hesitancy comes from weighing risks rather than opposing vaccines outright.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256975/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A scoop of ice cream or a fistful of chips can soothe more than the soul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long noticed the same comfort-seeking reflex in lab animals, hinting that something in the very act of eating can turn down the volume on pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon, known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3226930/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ingestion analgesia&lt;/a&gt;, crops up even when the “meal” is a single lick of sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that food might blunt discomfort has usually centered on the brain’s reward circuits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet a growing body of work is pulling the spotlight toward the nerves that sit outside the skull. These peripheral messengers, it turns out, don’t just ferry pain – they can hush it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enter-trpv1-and-d₂o"&gt;Enter TRPV1 and D₂O&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered a novel way to relieve pain by targeting TRPV1, a key ion channel involved in sensing heat and physical discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of using conventional painkillers, the approach uses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heavy water (D₂O)&lt;/a&gt; to subtly alter the channel’s behavior, effectively reducing its overactivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRPV1 is best known for triggering the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mild-chili-peppers-may-be-the-anti-spice-weve-been-looking-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burning sensation from chili peppers&lt;/a&gt;, but it also plays a central role in many types of pain, with the added benefit of being non-addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comfort-food-s-secret-side-effect"&gt;Comfort food’s secret side effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For rodents, a nibble of chocolate during a mild heat test leads to fewer squeaks and squirms. Scientists traced the mellowing effect to hormones that surge as digestion kicks in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief among them is glucagon-like peptide-1, or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weight-loss-drugs-unexpectedly-help-people-drink-less-alcohol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;, a gut signal that rises when nutrients hit the small intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, GLP-1 keeps blood sugar in check by nudging the pancreas to release insulin, but its life in the bloodstream is fleeting – barely one or two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers have stretched that clock by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/natural-alternative-to-ozempic-glp-1-fgf21-may-soon-be-available-for-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;crafting GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; analogs that linger for hours. These longer-lasting versions already help people with type 2 diabetes and, more recently, individuals seeking weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same molecules have been shown to sap pain inside the brain and spinal cord, raising a simple, tantalizing question: could they also soothe pain at the nerve endings scattered through skin, joints, and organs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trpv1-channel-the-gatekeeper"&gt;TRPV1 channel – the gatekeeper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh experiments suggest the answer is yes. GLP-1 appears to shoulder past a notorious gatekeeper of pain, the TRPV1 channel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of TRPV1 as a molecular thermostat: when capsaicin from a pepper, a hot stove, or acidic conditions switches it on, ions rush through its pore, igniting a pain signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/patients-with-chronic-pain-are-turning-to-cannabis-for-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain disorders&lt;/a&gt;, the channel can become hypersensitive, turning even a light touch into agony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12180212/TRPV1_water-permeability_drug-free-pain-relief_credit-NBE_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12180219/TRPV1_water-permeability_drug-free-pain-relief_credit-NBE_1s.webp" alt="Tracking the water permeability of TRPV1 using up-conversion nanoprobes in single live cells.

Click image to enlarge. Credit: Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly blocking TRPV1 has helped in animal tests, but the strategy often wreaks havoc with body temperature, leaving patients flushed or chilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 seems to take a subtler route. Instead of wedging the channel shut, it tweaks TRPV1 just enough to stop the excess firing while sparing the body’s heat control. The result is a calmer signal with no feverish side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cooling-down-a-hot-channel"&gt;Cooling down a hot channel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of that tweak came into sharper focus thanks to a collaboration that stretched from Singapore to Beijing. Professor Liu Xiaogang of the &lt;a href="https://nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National University of Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues had pivoted from hormones to water – specifically, heavy water, or D₂O. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their team fashioned a luminescent nanoprobe able to tell ordinary H₂O from its heftier cousin as the molecules darted through single TRPV1 pores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When D₂O slipped through the channel, pain signals in nerve cells sputtered. In living models of both acute and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-chronic-pain-have-high-rates-of-depression-and-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic inflammatory pain&lt;/a&gt;, injections of D₂O eased sensitivity without muting other nerve reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trpv1-pain-management-strategy"&gt;TRPV1 pain management strategy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery deepens our understanding of TRPV1 function and lays the groundwork for new pain-management strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team now plans to investigate how D₂O influences additional ion channels, aiming to adapt this mechanism for treating neurological disorders and other clinical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solvent-mediated pathway to analgesia stands out as a major advance in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chronic-pain-is-harder-to-treat-in-women-but-a-new-target-offers-hope/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain therapy&lt;/a&gt; and could usher in safer, non-addictive options for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although calming an overactive channel with solvent molecules may sound unconventional, D₂O is already well known in nuclear reactors and biochemical laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small doses it poses little risk, making it an appealing complement – rather than a replacement – to existing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pair GLP-1 analogs with the solvent trick and a two-pronged strategy emerges: tamp down abnormal TRPV1 activity while letting the body keep its natural thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach could offer relief to millions who live with neuropathic pain, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oregano-herb-helps-reduce-and-prevent-joint-pain-from-arthritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;, or lingering post-surgical aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all conditions where current options rely heavily on opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, both of which are carry-overs from the last century and are not without drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical translation will demand careful dosing studies, long-term safety checks, and creative formulations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the blueprint is simple: use a compound we already make after every meal, fortify it so it sticks around, and harness its knack for silencing wayward pain channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a dash of heavy water for extra finesse, and the humble act of eating might inspire the next generation of pain relief – no prescription for comfort food required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01288-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 00:27:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPRnRKenlMZzZVbEc3YlNoSWw1ZE5MVkM0UWFVWHdiWEhWdzZ0czNQU2Y3a3lBZ05KTWYzcnFaZHFHdnVZdUF1Z0VGQ1JIMy1tRWRWZHQteGREZGJWVUZpcEM5alFxTXNveWhwOHVCdXF0YlBqV2dRcEowYkMtN3gtLUg1MElYMVpaenpJS21NWndvUFN3VXN3M2JnQklnU3d6T0JxMDVGZG5QTVlab2d2bDR3</guid></item><item><title>营养学家正在分享你真正应该遵守的酒精“规则” ，包括每天饮酒不超过一杯的女性- BuzzFeed | Nutritionists Are Sharing Alcohol “Rules” You Should Really Be Following, Including Women Having No More Than One Drink Per Day - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQdk1VYlhST2R5TnNTUWhFS3dlWUhJbGlMZmd0WFRRTzZrZlljVlZfc29nWkVlU1diV2dJR0VuazlqRHluUmdCVGc4TWV3WnV4Qkt2MTJld0pSa1JNMHFiR0RtdGlrSVRXQXh1c0dGMFQ2cFM1ajdJT3FQalh1TW4yMUpFQjBHM3dp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;Byrne said it’s important to know the official definition of binge drinking. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888383" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The CDC says&lt;/a&gt; having five drinks or more on an occasion for men and four drinks or more for women is considered binge drinking. “I think it’s less than a lot of people think,” Byrne noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it: If you’ve ever been to a wedding where there’s cocktail hour, dinner, dancing and often an after-party, you know how easy it is to have four or five drinks during the celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What you do with alcohol is completely up to you, and just because you drink more than what’s considered binge drinking on a single occasion doesn’t necessarily mean you have an alcohol addiction or an alcohol problem,” Byrne said. “I want to make that clear, too, but technically speaking, that is the definition of binge drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Pay close attention to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re drinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who do choose to drink, Brooks said it’s important to pay attention to three things: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The frequency and quantity of your drinking: Use the CDC’s guidelines to assess how much and how often you’re drinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why you’re drinking: “Ask yourself, what is it that I think this drink will do for me?” Brooks said, adding that if you’re using alcohol to de-stress, let loose or be more social, know that you can do this without drinking. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there something else you can do or drink instead of alcohol? “Because there are actually so many ways that we can achieve those benefits that people think they’re getting from drinking, we can get all of those things without drinking,” Brooks said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are saying, ‘Well, I just need this drink because I just need to relax’ ... that alcohol itself isn’t actually what helps you relax. [What can give you that effect can] be the sitting, taking a break from what you’re doing or going to happy hour and talking to people, connecting to people, getting a change of scenery,” Brooks explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still relax without a glass of wine. You could take up coloring or take a bath with a seltzer by your side instead of a glass of wine, or you could go out for a walk for an after-work change of scenery, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If somebody believes that having that drink at the end of the day is their way to relax, then just by default they’re not thinking about other ways that they actually could decompress,” Brooks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond thinking about your intention with alcohol, it’s important to look at any red flags, too. “If you think your drinking might be problematic, ask yourself why you’re doing it,” Byrne said, “and if you’re doing it to avoid certain feelings or numb certain feelings, then that’s something to question and probably a reason to reassess your relationship with alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, it’s also a good idea to reach out to a therapist who’s trained in substance use treatment who can support you, Byrne added. The &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888383" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Psychology Today website&lt;/a&gt; can help you find a local mental health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Brooks noted that changing your drinking habits is not an easy feat. If you are trying to do this, it’s a good idea to lean on loved ones who have a similar mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need help with substance use disorder or mental health issues?

The finding suggests that environmental chemicals in the gut may fuel immune responses tied to mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They set out to discover how one gut bacterium might play an active role in major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Harvard and the Broad Institute focused on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27421818/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morganella morganii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a gut bacterium previously &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00991-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to depression, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their aim was to pinpoint a specific molecule that connects the bacterium to inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teens-with-problematic-smartphone-use-suffer-from-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/bioassay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bioassay&lt;/a&gt; approach, they discovered unusual &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/phospholipid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phospholipids&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt;. These lipids mimic cardiolipins but include an environmental contaminant, diethanolamine (DEA), instead of the usual glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-contaminant-triggers-inflammation"&gt;Contaminant triggers inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; adds a chemical called DEA to its fats (lipids), it changes the molecule in a way that triggers the body’s immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests showed that this new molecule turns on special sensors in immune cells called &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00461/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR1 and TLR2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once these sensors are activated, the immune cells release a substance called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4176007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interleukin-6 (IL-6)&lt;/a&gt;. IL-6 causes inflammation and has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7139933/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to depression in genetic studies, suggesting it plays a role in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a story out there linking the gut microbiome with depression, and this study takes it one step further, toward a real understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the link,” said senior author Jon Clardy, the Christopher T. Walsh, PhD Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in the &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/research/blavatnik-institute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blavatnik Institute&lt;/a&gt; at HMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-immune-system-and-bacterial-lipids"&gt;Immune system and bacterial lipids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that special lipids from &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; – called MmDEACLs – can kickstart the immune system by attaching to two receptors, TLR1 and TLR2, which are known for spotting bacterial molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set off the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a signaling protein linked to long-term inflammation and immune-related illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the twist: only the versions of these lipids that contained DEA caused a strong IL-6 response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that small changes in the shape of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fatty-acids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fatty acid chains&lt;/a&gt; – like having a double bond instead of a ring – made a big difference in how strongly the immune system reacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows that our immune system can pick up on very fine molecular details in bacterial chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery offers strong molecular evidence that gut bacteria altered by environmental pollutants can influence immune pathways tied to depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suggests &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-depression-often-hold-tightly-to-self-doubt/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; may have an autoimmune or inflammatory component in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raises the possibility that DEA‑modified lipids could serve as biomarkers, helping to identify individuals whose depression may stem from this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that micropollutants can be incorporated into fatty molecules in the body, but we didn’t know how this occurs or what happens next,” Clardy said. “DEA’s metabolism into an immune signal was completely unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chronic-gut-inflammation-and-depression"&gt;Chronic gut inflammation and depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5805548/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; inflammatory signals&lt;/a&gt; like IL-6 has been repeatedly linked to the development of depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated IL-6 levels are often found in people with major depressive disorder and can disrupt normal brain signaling, especially in mood-related areas like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, sparked by environmental contaminants processed by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983973/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, could act as a biological trigger for depression in some individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than being purely psychological, these cases might respond better to treatments that target the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work follows earlier &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001875/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; where individual gut bacteria and their molecules were tied to inflammation, immune modulation, and disease outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also strengthens the gut‑immune‑brain concept by adding a contaminant‑mediated chemical twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-environment-and-mental-health"&gt;Environment and mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of diethanolamine (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/diethanolamine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt;) in this study highlights the broader impact of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11352651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;environmental micropollutants&lt;/a&gt; on human biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEA is widely used in industrial processes and personal care products, and its presence in the environment means exposure is nearly unavoidable for most people in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a common bacterium like &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; transforms DEA into an immune-stimulating molecule, it creates a new layer of interaction between pollution, the microbiome, and the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection raises public health concerns about how chemical exposures might shape disease risks in ways not previously considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-treating-depression-in-the-gut"&gt;Treating depression in the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that while the mechanism is clear, further work is needed to determine how often this occurs in depressed individuals and whether blocking this pathway alleviates symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan to explore whether other gut microbes use similar chemical substitutions and what portion of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-too-much-salt-may-contribute-to-depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; cases might involve this contaminant‑inflammation route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know what we’re looking for, I think we can start surveying other bacteria to see whether they do similar chemistry and begin to find other examples of how metabolites can affect us,” said Clardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing how a gut bacterium turns a common contaminant into a pro‑inflammatory agent, the study offers new insight into the complex makeup of mental health disorders, and hints at novel ways to detect and treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/194993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sunghee Bang&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease and type 2 diabetes affect millions of people across the United States every year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While many of us are aware of common lifestyle changes to help reduce the risks, like staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and getting enough sleep, what we eat plays a major role too. A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet rich in plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt;, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, may do wonders for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-gut-and-heart-health-8771784" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supporting heart health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;managing blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But there’s one lesser-known piece of the puzzle that’s worth exploring further: phytosterols.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Phytosterols, sometimes called plant sterols, are naturally occurring compounds found in plants. What makes phytosterols special is their ability to block cholesterol absorption in the digestive system, which may help lower LDL (the "bad" cholesterol) levels. And new data shared at the American Society for Nutrition meeting in Orlando highlighted the potential impact consuming phytosterols may have on aspects of our overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this study, researchers gathered and analyzed data from three large cohorts involving over 200,000 adults in the United States. The participants, who were nurses and other health professionals, provided health and dietary information over a follow-up period of up to 36 years. By using food-frequency questionnaires, the researchers estimated the participants’ intake of total phytosterols and three specific types (β-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol). Participants were then categorized into quintiles based on their phytosterol intake, with the highest quintile representing the most plant-forward diets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond dietary data, the researchers collected biological samples from participants to analyze metabolic biomarkers and other health indicators. Blood samples from over 11,000 participants were examined to identify metabolites and markers related to insulin regulation, inflammation, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-have-metabolic-syndrome-8694742" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Additional blood samples from more than 40,000 participants were analyzed to detect specific biomarkers linked to heart disease and type 2 diabetes. These biomarkers offered insights into potential mechanisms through which phytosterols might influence disease risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore a potential link between phytosterol intake and gut health, the study also investigated the microbiome composition of a subset of 465 participants. Advanced genetic sequencing techniques were used to identify specific microbial species and enzymes present in these individuals' gut microbiomes. The goal was to examine whether certain microbes altered the metabolism of phytosterols in ways that contributed to lower disease risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The results of this study showed that those who consumed higher amounts of phytosterols experienced impressive health benefits. Participants in the top quintile of phytosterol intake had a 9% lower likelihood of developing heart disease and an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lignans-may-reduce-risk-of-diabetes-according-to-study-8696870" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;8% lower risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; when compared to those in the bottom quintile. These findings suggest that even within the range of normal dietary intake, phytosterols may make a meaningful difference in reducing the risk of these chronic diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Further analysis revealed that participants who consumed higher levels of total phytosterols and β-sitosterol had favorable changes in their metabolic markers. The researchers found evidence linking higher phytosterol intake to improved insulin regulation, lower levels of inflammation, and the presence of healthier metabolites. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, when it comes to gut health and phytosterol consumption, researchers identified microbial species and enzymes in the gut microbiome that were associated with higher phytosterol intake. For example, species like &lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; were linked to the degradation of phytosterols, potentially influencing the production of beneficial metabolites. This suggests that a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; might amplify the positive effects of phytosterols, per the researchers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study offers valuable insights, it’s important to note a few limitations. Since it’s an observational study, it can only suggest a link between phytosterol intake and a lower risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, rather than proving a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Most of the participants were health professionals, which means the results might not fully reflect the broader population. Additionally, the dietary information was self-reported through food-frequency questionnaires, which could include some errors or misremembered details. The study also found connections between phytosterol intake, microbiome changes and metabolic markers, but we still need more research to understand how these connections work. Lastly, the long follow-up period was helpful for tracking outcomes, but changes in diet and lifestyle over time, which weren’t entirely accounted for, could have played a role in the findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, these results are not published in a peer-reviewed journal, which means they should be interpreted with caution until further scrutiny validates the findings.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This new study presented at an American Society for Nutrition meeting highlights the compelling potential of phytosterols in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eating-more-protein-may-reduce-heart-disease-risk-8422551" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;promoting better heart and metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Across the three large cohorts studied, higher phytosterol intake was associated with a 9% lower risk of heart disease and an 8% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, which is especially significant given the prevalence of these conditions in the United States. The findings also revealed that individuals with diets rich in phytosterols saw &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improvements in insulin regulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduced inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to their role in fostering overall metabolic balance.

In the U.S., an &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated 7.2 million Americans ages 65 and older&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are living with Alzheimer's dementia in 2025. The percentage of affected people increases with age: About 5% of people ages 65 to 74 have Alzheimer's, compared with more than 33% of people ages 85 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the point when a doctor has verified that a patient has cognitive decline, the blood test can be used in place of standard tests to see if they likely have Alzheimer's. Previously, gold-standard methods of diagnosing Alzheimer's have been more invasive and expensive, involving positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which use radioactive substances; and lumbar punctures, (also called spinal taps) during which a clinician uses a needle to sample spinal fluid from the low back. Clinicians also sometimes use &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048075" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048075" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MRIs or CT scans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to rule out other causes of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test measures the ratio of two proteins in human blood, and this ratio correlates with the presence or absence of amyloid plaques, a primary sign of Alzheimer's found in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people experiencing memory lapses that might be due to Alzheimer's, the first step is to see their primary care physician (PCP), who should do a cognitive test. If there are signs of cognitive impairment, the patient would then be referred to a neurologist for an in-depth evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dementia specialists and PCPs will be able to order this blood test to help with diagnosis, said &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Gregg Day&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist with the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida; Day led a study of the blood test published in June in the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" target="_blank" data-url="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of the Alzheimer's Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A study published in 2024 in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821669" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821669" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;JAMA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that whether the test was ordered by a PCP or specialist, it was equally accurate at confirming suspected Alzheimer's diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PCPs could use the test results to decide whether to &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/visiting-your-doctor" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/diagnosis/visiting-your-doctor" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;refer patients to a specialist&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who could prescribe treatments &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/alzheimers-drug-lecanemab-explained" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/alzheimers-drug-lecanemab-explained"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as lecanemab or donanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Day said.

          &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer. Colon cancer. An enlarged thyroid gland. A family history of tumors and cancers as well. It wasn't until the woman developed an annoying case of dry mouth that doctors put it all together. By then, she was in her 60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2835072"&gt;a new case study in JAMA Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;, the woman presented to a dermatology clinic in Spain after three months of oral unpleasantness. They noted the cancers in her medical history. When she opened wide, doctors immediately saw the problem: Her tongue was covered in little wart-like bumps that resembled a slippery, flesh-colored cobblestone path. (Image &lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dim250007f1_1748619232.52078.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a cobblestone tongue is a telltale sign of a rare genetic condition called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525984/"&gt;Cowden syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. It's caused by inherited mutations that break a protein, called PTEN, leading to tumors and cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTEN, which stands for phosphatase and tensin homolog, generally helps keep cells from growing out of control. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221004065"&gt;PTEN deactivates a signaling protein called PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), and that deactivation blocks a signaling pathway (the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway) involved in regulating cell growth, survival, and migration. When PTEN is broken, PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; activity ramps up, and tumors can grow unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not-so-rare mutation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cowden syndrome, PTEN mutations lead to noncancerous tumors or masses called hamartomas, which can occur in any organ. But, people with the syndrome are also at high risk of developing a slew of cancerous growths—most commonly cancers of the breast, thyroid, and uterus—over their lifetime. That's why people diagnosed with the condition are advised to undergo intensive cancer screenings, including annual ultrasounds of the thyroid starting at age 7 and annual mammograms and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) starting at age 30 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

            Prenatal exposure to a class of dangerous, widely used chemicals could be linked to your child having high blood pressure as a teen, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvv00083b6m3pffytrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/health/pfas-explainer-wellness/index.html"&gt;PFAS&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they don’t fully break down in the environment — are a class of about 15,000 human-made chemicals linked to &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/news/2023/pfas-kidney-cancer-mec" target="_blank"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926449/" target="_blank"&gt;endocrine-related conditions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9976729/" target="_blank"&gt;developmental problems&lt;/a&gt; in children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw00093b6mxbrs2c8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New data shows the synthetic compounds could also be linked to a teen’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life, according to the study published Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039949" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000a3b6me38v9g0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers looked at data from 1,094 children over an average of 12 years. The study team compared measurements of eight types of PFAS chemicals in maternal plasma samples 24 to 72 hours after birth and the children’s blood pressure from medical records, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000b3b6mk5x624si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The kids who were exposed to higher levels of PFAS chemicals in utero were more likely to have higher blood pressure in childhood and adolescence, the research found. The connection was particularly strong in adolescents, male children and Black children, said senior study author Dr. Mingyu Zhang, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000c3b6mvcbp8ejw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study is observational, meaning that while it shows associations, it cannot prove that PFAS exposure is the cause of the elevated blood pressure, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000d3b6mu0h79gfs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While researchers did adjust for other factors that could be at play, there could be other elements driving the connection between PFAS and blood pressure, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000e3b6mochkptok@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That said, the results are strong because this study is one of the largest and most diverse while also using rigorous methods, said Dr. Carmen Marsit, Rollins Distinguished Professor of Research at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000f3b6mrpcn6j08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The topic is important to investigate because if a child has high blood pressure, they are more likely to also have higher blood pressure later on, Zhang said. And that is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000g3b6m4b6eskxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The largest effects were shown in adolescents who were exposed to a mixture of different PFAS chemicals during pregnancy compared with those who were not, which implies that there may be a synergistic impact on cardiometabolic health, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000h3b6mac3daaim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most children will be exposed to multiple different PFAS chemicals, so this is worrisome,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000i3b6m7ki8f4g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fact that adolescence is the age when prenatal exposure to PFAS is most linked with higher blood pressure suggests that some of the PFAS chemicals could take a long period of time to show their impacts, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000j3b6mgj1c6ct0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A long latency of the effects would mean that people don’t just need to worry about reducing exposures, but interventions also need to be developed to prevent the health outcomes in people who were exposed earlier, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000k3b6ml1rtwhui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only are PFAS forever chemicals –– they also are everywhere chemicals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000l3b6m0pakojdp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; shows that this class of chemicals can be found in nearly every person in the United States, Marsit said &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/health/pfas-explainer-wellness"&gt;in a previous CNN story.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000m3b6mywq959jd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are things you can do to reduce your exposure, however, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000n3b6macy6vjlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Major sources of exposure include food, water, and waterproof or stain-resistant items, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000o3b6m6rsis85p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Helpful steps include drinking filtered water –– using filters like those listed by the Environmental Working Group –– out of metal or glass containers, he said. Plastics contain PFAS and other toxic chemicals, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000p3b6mowkak1px@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A focus on fresh food can also help, as packaging for foods are often coated in PFAS chemicals, he added. And avoid using nonstick cookware, opting instead for metal, cast-iron or ceramic pots and pans, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000q3b6m84utj4tc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dusting, vacuuming, and washing your hands before eating or drinking can also reduce PFAS exposure, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000r3b6mtn01owi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of high blood pressure for children who have been exposed to PFAS, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000s3b6m1ejcki1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These include maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, reducing salt intake, and encouraging physical activity,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000t3b6m1h1a2z27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But ultimately, an individual cannot solve PFAS exposure alone, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000u3b6mdoolqdbh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We also need policy-level actions to limit and phase out PFAS use in products and industry, and to strengthen monitoring and regulation of PFAS in water systems,” he added.

&lt;p&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services confirmed its first case of measles in a Dallas County resident for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to DCHHS, the case involves a female in her mid-20s who was fully vaccinated. She was contagious from May 30, 2025, until June 7, 2025, DCHHS said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;DCHHS said individuals who were at the places at the times listed below may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to the individual while she was contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma Coffee Plano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1023 E 15th St, Plano, TX 75074&lt;br&gt;May 31, 2025, from 9 a.m. to noon.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Baptist Plano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;3665 W President George Bush Hwy, Plano, TX 75075&lt;br&gt;June 1, 2025, from 1 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCHHS officials said the woman has received care, and public health officials are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to DCHHS, this is an ongoing investigation of an isolated case because the source of the woman's exposure to measles is unknown at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our priority is to protect the health and well-being of all Dallas County residents," said Dr. Philip Huang, Director at Dallas County Health and Human Services. "We are actively investigating this case and working to identify any individuals who may have been exposed. The best way to protect yourself from measles is to receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are required to receive full protection.”&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is the vaccine safe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old, and the second for children between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before kindergarten in public schools nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, there are usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials said that number is likely higher because it doesn’t include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are public health officials doing to stop the spread?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinics and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the researchers also found that those who drank sodas loaded with saccharin had a 110 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No link was found between type 2 diabetes and aspartame or sucralose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lyn M Steffen, an epidemiology professor at the University of Minnesota and study author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The observational study did not determine the reason why artificial sweeteners may lead to type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also remains unclear how much of diet soda was being consumed by participants in each group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has indicated that diet sodas are healthier alternatives to regular soda for diabetic patients as they cannot directly raise blood sugar levels since they have no regular sugar in them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers believe that consuming excessive diet sodas with artificial sweeteners that are overall much sweeter than real sugar may interfere with the body's metabolism process and lead to excess sugar in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this is not the first time saccharin has come under fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 Medicina study found that long-term saccharin consumption increases the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, liver and renal impairment in rats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also lead to the development of brain cancer in rats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, men should consume no more than 36 grams or 150 calories of sugar per day while women should consume no more than 25 grams or 100 calories of sugar per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess sugar consumption can pave the way for weight gain, high blood pressure, heart disease and insulin resistance, which can cause type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition and over 37 million American adults suffer from this form of the chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reports that over 100,000 Americans die of type 2 diabetes every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is caused by &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11238421/Even-SLIM-type-2-diabetics-reverse-condition.html"&gt;either the pancreas not producing enough insulin&lt;/a&gt; - a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels - or the body's cells not responding properly to insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you eat sugar, your body breaks it down into glucose, which the enters your bloodstream for energy absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To regulate blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases insulin, which helps glucose enter your cells for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But consuming excessive amounts of sugar can make the body resistant to insulin, meaning it can't effectively use the insulin to lower blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to high blood sugar levels and a buildup of glucose in the bloodstream, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the chronic illness cannot be permanently treated, patients are advised to regulate their blood sugar levels through medication, healthy eating, physical activity and stress management.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 16:50:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么神秘的美国农村群体遭受国家最大杀手的可能性要低九倍-每日邮报 | Why mysterious group of rural Americans are NINE TIMES less likely to suffer from country's biggest killers -

One study estimated the rate of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-0d10e470-460f-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; among the Amish to be less than one percent compared to about 13 percent of the general population at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2007 study projected that 10 percent of Amish women experience anxiety compared to 28 percent of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The small communities are spread mostly throughout &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-a0a84720-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-a0a82010-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6" class=""&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-a0a70ea0-456d-11f0-b7db-dd878349baf6" class=""&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; numbering around 400,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-11895705/Amish-teen-shares-glimpse-life-community-REALLY-like-embarks-Rumspringa.html"&gt;close-knit and removed&lt;/a&gt; from most of the toxins ubiquitous in everyday 21st century life, from processed foods to highway pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health researchers have long viewed Amish communities as isolated worlds - unique, self-contained populations that remain essentially unchanged after more than 300 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish communities live largely agrarian lives, with people from age 6 to 60 working in the fields, kitchens and homes without modern machines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They lead agrarian lifestyles, with everyone from children to elders working together in fields or small businesses, kitchens and homes, often without modern machinery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say this physically active, family-centered way of life fosters deep fulfillment, self worth and enduring mental and physical vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These qualities, which many argue have been eroded, protect the mind against depression and the brain against Alzheimer's disease, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tobacco use in Amish communities is up to 40 percent lower than in the general population, contributing to far fewer tobacco-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rates of cancers, including those linked to tobacco use, were shown in one 2010 study of Ohio Amish communities to be &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19779840/"&gt;40 percent lower&lt;/a&gt; than non-Amish Ohioans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;They are nine times less likely to be obese, which in turn lowers their risk of some of the country's biggest killers: cancer , heart disease and dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For religious reasons, alcohol consumption is also uncommon - in an Ohio Amish community, just 6 percent of men and under 2 percent of women reported drinking, compared to around 60 to 70 percent of average Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have also found some Amish people in Indiana possess a gene mutation that allows them&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://magazine.northwestern.edu/news/amish-fountain-of-youth-genetic-mutation-protects-some-amish-against-aging"&gt; to live 10 percent longer&lt;/a&gt;, keeps their blood vessels healthy, and insulin levels low. This mutation reduces levels of a protein called PAI-1, which plays a key role in aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here's a breakdown of how the truly unplugged lifestyle contributes to good health, according to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8857275/#R42"&gt;NIH-funded research&lt;/a&gt; and academic studies on Amish cultural and health norms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;They're constantly active&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every Amish community member between the ages of 6 and 60 is physically active from sunrise through sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men and women in an Amish community in Aylmer, Ontario, get &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14707772/"&gt;between three and 10 hours&lt;/a&gt; of vigorous exercise a week and take around 14,000 to 18,000 steps daily - this doesn't drop off even as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to children who are not Amish, Lancaster Amish children spend nearly an extra hour each day being active, especially through moderate to vigorous exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;They eat from their own land&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish communities typically eat fresh, chemical-free foods that &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21317401/"&gt;come from their farms&lt;/a&gt; and gardens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Butter is &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22026912/"&gt;churned at home&lt;/a&gt;, bread is baked fresh every day, and vegetables are hand-harvested and eaten within four hours of being picked, which locks in more nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Caroline Brock, a sociologist focusing on Amish farming and food systems at the University of Missouri, told the Daily Mail that, 'In general, more [Amish people] on average would have a small garden with a handful of chickens, a cow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish families may not grow their own wheat (they buy their flour and other basic necessities), but 'they're eating more vegetables from their garden and they spend less money on food on average,' Dr. Brock said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Amish also tend to avoid sweeteners, only using a tablespoon of honey or maple syrup a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they cultivate most of their food, Amish communities aren't exposed to the hidden added sugars, preservatives and food dyes in much of our processed foods. Their produce is also cultivated without the use of carcinogenic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;By growing and storing  their own food, Amish communities avoid hidden sugars, preservatives and dyes found in store-bought foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Fermented foods are a staple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish families regularly eat fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickled vegetables and homemade yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many Amish families start meals with three tablespoons of fermented vegetables, which help support digestion and gut health by feeding good bacteria into the digestive system, according to the NIH study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A balanced gut microbiome has been linked to stronger immunity, better digestion and lower rates of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Their biggest meal is at noon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish meals are carefully timed to work with the body's natural circadian rhythms. The largest meal of the day takes place between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., when the sun is highest in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to fueling a labor-intensive day, front-loading &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9605877/"&gt;calories early &lt;/a&gt;helps balance energy and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Amish folks stick to traditional food prep methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of relying on processed, shelf-stable foods with harmful additives, Amish communities use canning, pickling and fermenting methods to store their fresh fruits, vegetables and meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Canning locks in nutrients at their peak freshness and pickling preserves the food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While fermentation both preserves food and can enhance its nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish life centers on close family, church and community ties that protect against depression and anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amish families wake at dawn and turn in after sunset, naturally syncing with circadian rhythms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;No screen time &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Amish shun modern technological comforts,&lt;span&gt; navigating without Google Maps and communicating without social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Living without TVs, smartphones or computers means fewer hours are spent watching news alerts, seeing advertisements and scrolling social media, which can trigger feelings of anxiety and inadequacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Business owners in the community may share a phone with other families or with a non-Amish person, Dr. Brock said, but modern technology is not a daily presence in most Amish people's lives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown excessive smartphone use has a deleterious effect on people's mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10587281/#Sec2"&gt;on Australian adults&lt;/a&gt; measured their phone usage based on a questionnaire that asked them to rate statements like, 'There are times when I would rather use the smartphone than deal with other more pressing issues.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who use their phones a little to a moderate amount had a lower average depression score of 12.1, while those with very high smartphone use had a score of 17.8 - higher scores indicate more severe symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Minimal exposure to toxins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without cars, Amish people are exposed to less air pollution, and their reliance on homegrown foods means they avoid the synthetic chemicals, preservatives and additives in most grocery store items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Growing up on farms, Amish children are also exposed to a mix of natural microbes in soil, animals and fresh air, a factor researchers believe contributes to their low rates of asthma and allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/news-items/study-finds-amish-childrens-exposures-protect-against-asthma/"&gt;5 percent of Amish schoolchildren&lt;/a&gt; ages 6 to 14 have asthma, which is about half of the US average (10.3 percent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Tobacco and alcohol use is extremely rare &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some Amish men use tobacco, its use overall is far less prevalent compared to non-Amish communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2009 study of Amish people living in Ohio found that community members &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10552-009-9435-7"&gt;had a 37&lt;/a&gt; percent lower rate of tobacco-related cancers compared to other adults in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking alcohol is also rare in Amish communities. In one study, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2742796/"&gt;just 6.4 percent of men and 1.7 percent of women&lt;/a&gt; reported consuming booze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[In the Old Order Amish sect] the communion is twice a year, and they use real alcoholic wine,' Dr. Brock said. 'It's a functional thing. It's used to preserve food. But they're not going to drink for drinking's sake.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Compared to children who are not Amish, Lancaster Amish children in Pennsylvania spend nearly an extra hour each day being active, especially through moderate to vigorous exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Sleep aligns with nature's clock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish families wake at dawn and turn in after sunset, naturally syncing with circadian rhythms, which makes it easier to fall asleep and wake as daylight changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2011 study looking into Amish sleep patterns found that members of the community &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3079946/#sec18"&gt;consistently went to bed&lt;/a&gt; between 9-10 p.m. and woke up at 5:30 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sticking to a consistent sleep schedule has been linked to a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11212029/"&gt;lower risk of dying&lt;/a&gt;, reduced &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29776774/"&gt;risk of mood disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2023/irregular-sleep-patterns-linked-heart-disease-risks"&gt;better heart health&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aligning one's sleep in this way supports better hormone regulation (including melatonin), boosts mood and cognitive function, and reduces the risk of developing metabolic conditions like diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Amish people value strong community bonds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amish life is deeply rooted in close-knit family ties, involvement in the church and maintaining in-person connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This creates a strong social fabric that provides emotional support and a sense of belonging, which protects against depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Part of why they have the rules around technology that they do is to emphasize labor that they can do together as a family and as a community,' Dr. Brock said, using a dishwasher as an example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Washing dishes] is something that children can do together.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily rituals, such as gathering to share what they are grateful for and community celebrations, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2950386825000085#:~:text=For%20each%20unit%20of%20increase,/%CE%B2%20=%20%E2%88%920.049)."&gt;keep people's minds sharp&lt;/a&gt;

Why do these youngsters develop &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/atopic-eczema/"&gt;atopic eczema&lt;/a&gt; when their friends do not – especially if they share similar environments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team has been looking into whether a child’s genetic profile influences the risk of eczema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reviewing a set of data involving children from several countries, the experts uncovered hints that a household &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/national-puppy-day-2025-where-happiness-meets-responsibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; might help offset some of the genetic factors behind itchy skin irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Sara Brown from the University of Edinburgh’s &lt;a href="http://The%20Institute%20of%20Genetics%20and%20Cancer%20%20%20https://g.co/kgs/DQMJEzs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Institute of Genetics and Cancer&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Marie Standl from &lt;a href="https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Helmholtz Munich&lt;/a&gt; contributed to this work and brought fresh insight into how these influences might unfold for families everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-eczema-in-children"&gt;Understanding eczema in children&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eczema involves red, inflamed patches that can be difficult to soothe. This condition arises from a blend of inherited makeup and influences such as early-life bacterial contact or exposure to specific animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a family history of dry skin issues does not guarantee a child will develop it, but it raises the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have wondered why certain kids with a genetic variant live free of symptoms while others encounter a lifetime of creams and lotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db460.htm#Key_finding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; note that 7.3% of adults aged 18 and over have eczema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have long suspected that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/are-dogs-replacing-children-how-modern-society-is-changing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dogs&lt;/a&gt; might play a protective part for some children, and this new investigation adds support to that theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-may-protect-children-from-eczema"&gt;Dogs may protect children from eczema&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families with a pet dog often report that their kids seem to have fewer episodes of skin flare-ups. The researchers wanted to see if this pattern held up at a molecular level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They focused on a segment of DNA near the interleukin-7 receptor (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17660817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IL-7R&lt;/a&gt;), which helps the body regulate immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that genetic make-up affects a child’s risk of developing eczema and previous studies have shown that owning a pet dog may be protective,” said Professor Brown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One part of the study found that children with a slight twist in that gene could sidestep the usual risk for eczema if they had a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-our-relationships-with-dogs-matter-so-much/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; in their household early in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-siblings-might-help-reduce-eczema-risk"&gt;Siblings might help reduce eczema risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have also noticed that having older brothers or sisters might offer some protection. Observations point to a possible link between exposure to unique bacteria from siblings and a child’s reaction to environmental triggers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to confirm how varied bacterial environments influence the genetic component of eczema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not every preventive measure works for everyone, and that’s precisely why gene-environment studies are crucial,” said Dr. Standl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families sometimes consider adding a second child or adopting a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dogs-suffer-from-the-january-blues-just-like-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; to reduce eczema risk. Not every measure works for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dogs-don-t-work-for-every-eczema-case"&gt;Dogs don’t work for every eczema case&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists emphasize that having a dog from day one does not guarantee eczema-free skin. The recent work did not examine the effects of dogs on treating existing cases of eczema. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many professionals caution that introducing an animal might irritate symptoms that are already present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that contact with dog-related bacteria might shape a child’s immune response in ways that shift how that interleukin-7 receptor behaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though this gene variation is not the only cause of eczema, it appears to be important in controlling inflammation. Early-life dog exposure could modify that gene’s effect so the skin’s defensive barriers stay in better shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-diversity-in-research-matters"&gt;Why diversity in research matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest findings draw primarily from white European participants, prompting calls for more studies in other populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eczema affects millions of people &lt;a href="https://nationaleczema.org/eczema-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, including groups with differing genetic backgrounds. A broader pool of participants will help clarify how these discoveries apply to families everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents often wonder if a dog in the home might lower the odds of their child facing red, itchy skin every night. These early results support the idea that dog ownership might help in specific genetic situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More data from a wider range of people will show whether the same pattern exists in other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eczema-genetics-and-the-future"&gt;Eczema, genetics, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts continue exploring the interplay between genetic traits and outside factors to better understand why some children develop eczema. They aim to refine the science so parents have straightforward answers about potential lifestyle steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work may also investigate whether other pets or environmental exposures shape this immune balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team believes that continuing to map the roles of various gene variants could open the door to targeted prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can stay alert to new findings on additional ways to keep a child’s skin barrier strong. They may also want to consult a pediatrician before making major decisions, especially if a youngster already struggles with chronic irritation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.16605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Allergy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 16:06:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQWnBtdWVlNzlXeWl6NndSaFJ6Y3pXNEZkcjhXTTJjNUxfektzdkRCaVBTZHdJYXlIY3Q4aTEtejhVblJrUXdhUmhfTmpsYlRLcTY1c0NOeFlMT0dLVmxxQ0Z0WVFfUTkwTkc0MkNPTG8ybnE4b3dZVzBwRDJfX1FDNGtlMXE</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现，每个人都有独特的“呼吸印记” -《纽约时报》 | Each Person Has a Unique ‘Breath Print,’ Scientists Find - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBQa2k1TzZCV2RnR1VFeF9relEtRVZJTkxKcWllUE1CU1B5Z3NHbjZCNm9POG5UekVCMU9wMkJaWEpIc2xtbGR5bG9kNE9VS3huajd5RWR0cVpiOXVmbkhneUwyUFVjc1hudFRGUUNtU0dXOXotRmpuRWhBejE3cTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 15:00:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBQa2k1TzZCV2RnR1VFeF9relEtRVZJTkxKcWllUE1CU1B5Z3NHbjZCNm9POG5UekVCMU9wMkJaWEpIc2xtbGR5bG9kNE9VS3huajd5RWR0cVpiOXVmbkhneUwyUFVjc1hudFRGUUNtU0dXOXotRmpuRWhBejE3cTQ</guid></item><item><title>发现主要的糖替代品会损害脑血管细胞功能，构成潜在的中风风险- Medical Xpress | Major sugar substitute found to impair brain blood vessel cell function, posing potential stroke risk - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQQVBpVFFFN0s0bm5UY0JJU3NjWFVFVGRtSTFxV241STlNTGJQZDVKeTVJbTRYZS1HdlRHVFpSNS1BNkFMclAzeFNjQzV2UHFQNjhHT0lpYTRrbW9lMV9PcDNXVVZ2b3pQbkhBSUpHN0ZEcTh4Wno5ZWZ6Yl9NRjh2QWJ6d2J0QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol may impair cellular functions essential to maintaining brain blood vessel health, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder. Findings suggest that erythritol increases oxidative stress, disrupts nitric oxide signaling, raises vasoconstrictive peptide production, and diminishes clot-dissolving capacity in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Erythritol has become a fixture in the ingredient lists of protein bars, low-calorie beverages, and diabetic-friendly baked goods. Its appeal lies in its sweetness-to-calorie ratio, roughly 60–80% as sweet as sucrose with a tiny fraction of the energy yield, and its negligible effect on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;. Erythritol is also synthesized endogenously from glucose and fructose via the pentose phosphate pathway, leaving baseline levels subject to both dietary and metabolic influences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about erythritol's safety have escalated following epidemiological studies linking higher plasma concentrations with increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Positive associations between circulating erythritol and incidence of heart attack and stroke have been observed in U.S. and European cohorts, independent of known cardiometabolic risk factors. A causal mechanism for the link has remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "The Non-Nutritive Sweetener Erythritol Adversely Affects Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell Function," &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed in vitro experiments to test the cellular consequences of erythritol exposure on cerebral endothelial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells were cultured and exposed to an amount of erythritol equivalent to consuming a typical beverage. Experimental conditions included five biological replicates per group.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Cellular assays measured &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidant protein expression, nitric oxide bioavailability, endothelin production, and fibrinolytic capacity. Capillary electrophoresis immunoassay and ELISA were used to quantify expression of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1), catalase, endothelial &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nitric+oxide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nitric oxide&lt;/a&gt; synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells exposed to erythritol exhibited a substantial increase in oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species levels rose by approximately 75% relative to untreated controls. Antioxidant defense markers were also elevated, with SOD-1 expression increasing by approximately 45% and catalase by approximately 25%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide production declined by nearly 20% in response to erythritol. Although total eNOS expression remained unchanged, phosphorylation at the Ser1177 site, which is associated with enzymatic activation, fell by approximately 33%. In contrast, phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr495 site increased by approximately 39%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another test, t-PA release in response to thrombin stimulation was blunted in erythritol-treated cells, indicating reduced fibrinolytic responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers conclude that erythritol exposure disrupts multiple mechanisms vital to maintaining cerebral endothelial health. Although results are limited to acute in vitro conditions, the findings align with prior epidemiological associations between erythritol and elevated stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors recommend further investigation using long-term and in vivo models, citing the need for clinical studies to clarify whether repeated dietary exposure to erythritol carries cerebrovascular consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

I've witnessed the benefits that a reliable CGM can have on my health thanks to Abbott's Lingo, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-otc-glucose-monitor-encouraged-me-to-change-my-eating-habits-heres-how/"&gt;which I tested&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-otc-glucose-monitor-encouraged-me-to-change-my-eating-habits-heres-how/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This OTC glucose monitor encouraged me to change my eating habits - here's how&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when Dexcom sent me its &lt;span class="c-commerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stelo-Biosensor-Continuous-Monitoring-Personalized/dp/B0DTZ616WZ?tag=zdnet-buy-button-20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="B0DTZ616WZ" data-aps-asc-tag="zd-buy-button-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="__COM_CLICK_ID__|null|dtp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stelo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the first over-the-counter CGM to hit the market last year, I was eager to see what it could do for my health and compare it to the Abbott Lingo. &lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/en-us/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" class="c-regularLink"&gt;According to Dexcom&lt;/a&gt;, the Stelo has a 93% accuracy rate, so I compared the Stelo's results against a traditional finger-stick monitor during my two-week testing period. Here's how it went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Applying the sensor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you can begin tracking, you'll need to apply the sensor. The app provides step-by-step instructions, and you essentially stamp it onto the back of your arm, about three inches away from any injection sites, and in an area with enough fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stelo utilizes a button to trigger the sensor's application, deploying a flexible needle. I felt some adrenaline and heat in the area, but these sensations disappeared after a few minutes. This was the worst part of the process. The needle didn't feel like a traditional shot from the doctor's office, but more like getting your ears pierced with a piercing gun. Plus, Stelo's sensor is a bit smaller than Lingo's, so I thought it was a more convenient fit on the back of my arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-a-49-otc-continuous-glucose-monitor-for-two-weeks-heres-what-i-learned/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I tested a $49 OTC continuous glucose monitor for two weeks - here's what I learned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying, it asks you a few personal questions, and from there, gives you a target range of glucose. Mine was 70-140, which means that having a 70 might be your resting rate, while after eating, it should move up to the &amp;gt;140 to reflect food intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-color-black"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close-up of the Stelo on the back of my arm. The adhesive gets very dirty, very easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall u-block"&gt;Allison Jewell/ZDNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this sensor, you wait about 20 minutes to receive active readings. Then, the process begins as you log food, stress, and exercise for 15 days. The app's AI software then takes the data from your readings and events or meals you logged to give you insights on stabilizing your glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-smart-rings-ive-tested-beats-out-the-oura-3-and-ultrahuman/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the best smart rings I've tested beats out the Oura 3 and Ultrahuman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gen AI software uses Google Cloud's &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-updates-gemini-and-gemma-on-vertex-ai-and-gives-imagen-a-text-to-live-image-generator/"&gt;Vertex AI&lt;/a&gt; platform to personalize the Stelo experience. For now, the AI only provides weekly insights from the information collected by the sensor, as well as the food, events, and stress you log. It is in the beginning stages, so Dexcom is still developing the technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Spike alerts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My last trial using Abbott's Lingo CGM helped me tackle broader eating habits. For instance, it helped me reintroduce breakfast into my life, prioritize protein, and gave me a glimpse into how stress affects my body's glucose from Lingo's weekly insights in tandem with playing detective to figure out what food worked best with my body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-used-oura-rings-new-cgm-integration-to-track-my-glucose-heres-what-i-learned/"&gt;I used Oura Ring's new CGM integration to track my glucose for a few weeks. Here's what I learned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Lingo, the Stelo showed me how much stress can affect glucose and, in turn, the rest of your body. Driving and playing video games with my friends seemed to drive up my glucose the most. A casual game of Fortnite with my friends caused a spike and crash, helping me realize I need to control my mental state in those stressful situations and supplement my body with ample nutrients, such as vegetables, healthy fats, and protein instead of high-sugar carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying close attention to which carbs affected my body the most also played a significant role in my experience with the Stelo. Diet isn't all-or-nothing, I learned. A few of your favorite high-sugar foods or snacks once in a while aren't going to hurt you, especially if you pair them with activity or nutrient-dense foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do this not only by watching your glucose in real time but also by reading the app's education. I appreciated the app's spike alerts, which helped me avoid constantly checking my glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smartwatch/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best smartwatches you can buy: Expert tested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also connect your data with your healthcare provider for an informed opinion. Your provider has a certain code for their clinic, which you can enter in the Stelo app. Once pasted, your data is automatically streamed to your provider through Dexcom's Clarity software. You can also request a hard copy of your data from your provider, but not through the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What I'd like to see with the next model&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-color-black"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a screenshot of a 24-hour period of data. The app allows you to look at data on certain days back months, which is handy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall u-block"&gt;Screenshot by Allison Jewell/ZDNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I learned how vital exercise -- even a small burst in the middle of the day or after a big meal -- is to stabilize glucose. Even if it's just a 15-minute walk each day, I could see the effects through the app's data. When I started the sensor, my average glucose was in the 60s, just under the target resting range of 70. While it's not unhealthy, I could feel the physical effects of lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-expert-backed-tips-to-get-better-sleep-especially-if-you-own-a-health-tracking-wearable/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 expert-backed tips to get better sleep -especially if you own a health-tracking wearable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I completed the next week of meal and stress logging, the app finally suggested adding a small amount of exercise to stabilize my glucose stream. The next week, I began to walk 15 minutes before work and 15 minutes after dinner. I slowly saw my glucose average rise to the 70-80 range pre-meal and had steady inclines after meals, with minimal spikes and crashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, my birthday weekend came, and my consumption of birthday cake, alcohol, and hot chicken without exercise reset all of my progress as I started to get more spike and crash alerts, and could literally see it on the graph compared to when I was mindfully eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How accurate is the Stelo?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researching the Stelo, I saw some Reddit posts reporting inaccurate readings compared to other readers. As it is the first iteration of the product, there are bound to be certain inaccuracies. However, there are many reasons why your Stelo CGM reading might not match up to a standard finger-prick monitor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, when comparing your Stelo readings to a conventional finger-pricking monitor, you have to factor in a 20% margin of error. This is because Stelo reads the glucose levels from your interstitial fluid, while the finger-prick monitor measures glucose from your blood. Naturally, your interstitial fluid lags behind your blood in terms of glucose levels. It especially lags when you eat a carb or sugar-heavy meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also: &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-my-health-tracker/"&gt;How I learned to stop worrying and love my health tracker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most glucose monitors on the market have a healthy margin of error. This is because pinpoint accuracy can be affected by external factors like temperature, user error, interference with test strips, and more. Ultimately, most glucose monitors have a 10% margin of error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the two weeks, I compared my readings to a traditional finger-prick monitor. I recorded my glucose when I woke up, after my first meal, and then after dinner. Altogether, I found that the Stelo monitor rarely dipped below or above the 20% margin. If anything, my finger-prick monitor had more inaccurate one-off readings. Below are just a few of my compared readings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="547e0987-8c78-40d8-adad-be65eb7637a1" class="c-shortcodeListicle g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium"&gt; &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_conten"&gt;  &lt;div class="c-shortcodeListicle_dek"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stelo reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finger-prick reading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning pre food 4/30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;83&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;89&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After lunch 4/30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;95&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After dinner 4/30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;93&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning pre food 5/1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;89&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;82&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After lunch 5/1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;72&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;81&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After dinner 5/1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;114&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;133&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning pre food 5/2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;92&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After lunch 5/2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;88&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;85&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After dinner 5/2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;93&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;88&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;a data-cy="infoCard_showMore" class="c-shortcodeInfocard-faq-showMore"&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were quite a few instances where I ate a carb-heavy dinner and saw the CGM lag behind the finger-prick monitor. Still, the Stelo's readings were just a few points off, showing that the Stelo is quite accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would assess my monitor as accurate and, in some cases, reflecting my glucose's lag in migration from my blood to my interstitial fluid. If you're worried about the accuracy of your CGM, I suggest considering margin error, glucose's travel path, and other external factors while wearing the Stelo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Minimal first iteration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The over-patch used to secure the device to my arm became dirty very easily. After a few days, I experienced sharp pain from my first sensor, so I removed it. The new sensor I applied did not cause that issue. I also had a defunct CGM during my second round with the product, even after applying it and waiting 24 hours to see if it would ever turn on. I eventually gave up and put on the other one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-color-black"&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stelo landing page, which is very simple to navigate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall u-block"&gt;Allison Jewell/ZDNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the functions of this first iteration are minimal&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; like the Lingo, the Stelo has lots of potential for future iterations -- especially with the AI coaching and &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-used-oura-rings-new-cgm-integration-to-track-my-glucose-heres-what-i-learned/"&gt;its collaboration with Oura&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Stelo and Lingo utilize generative AI software, which provides personalized insights and guidance for each individual's needs. But that's it, the AI features end there. Dexcom has big plans to implement more AI-powered features on the device, like a possible new AI function that allows you to take a picture of your food and receive its nutrient information. This feature could be game-changing for dieting apps, as logging food so specifically can be tedious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The best Apple Watch you can buy: Expert tested&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Stelo's generative AI feature sound enticing, Dexcom must expand it to provide users with consistent, comprehensive, and beneficial advice. It took a week to receive a suggestion from my weekly insights about adding exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who had previously used a CGM, I knew what to work on. However, someone who only has a sensor for a month may not have enough time to fully understand their metabolism. I would love to see more suggestions and tweaks from the software, such as daily insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;ZDNET's buying advice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="c-commerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stelo-Biosensor-Continuous-Monitoring-Personalized/dp/B0DTZ616WZ?tag=zdnet-buy-button-20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="B0DTZ616WZ" data-aps-asc-tag="zd-buy-button-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="__COM_CLICK_ID__|null|dtp"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stelo by Dexcom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; retails for $99 for two 30-day sensors. This device offers an easy-to-use interface to help people make better choices about managing their glucose levels. This device could be very beneficial for those who struggle with obesity, prediabetes, or Type 2 diabetes (not on insulin). Preventing metabolic diseases like Type 2 diabetes takes lots of effort, education, and time, which is why Stelo could be a useful tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-outer-spacing-bottom-large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even hard-core athletes could benefit from this technology to maximize their performance as biologically possible. The Stelo could help give people control over their bodies, with the caveat that it will cost $99 per month. I recommend the Stelo over the Lingo if you prefer a smaller sensor, a quicker way to log events, and a more straightforward process for monitoring your glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ZDNET</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 14:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiygFBVV95cUxQdzFiMUttcW1sVmNGV002TVVraXY3WlctQngzZk8tUy1lZ0hDVWhKamNzclBLRzExb2VQS2xoYmtZeUhlYU9LUzRqMlJwa0ZKRzBxY1ZZbGlwMzl1Wm01MlVSMHE0a0l0Mjg4NHpHMk8tS3lSV1NNdjNwTDN3Rmw5ZzNhU1R3aEJpQlMyd1VYT0hQNkZkYU1ZdjJCSlhKeUszU0o0OXdVaWE3UWFlQ1BvRjlGN2VRcEpKMFVNTjE3dVlwUk50UWdTVzVR</guid></item><item><title>肌酸会损害您的肾脏吗？神话、事实以及您需要注意的事项-印度时报 | Can creatine damage your kidneys?

It’s like the OG of workout supplements—helping with strength, muscle growth, and even brain power. But there’s always been that one lingering worry: Can creatine mess with your kidneys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short answer? For most healthy people— it’s totally safe. But, like with anything, there’s some nuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is creatine?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body actually makes creatine on its own. It’s made in liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and gets stored in your muscles. When you do quick, explosive stuff like sprinting or lifting weights, your muscles use creatine for fast energy. Supplements (usually creatine monohydrate) just bump up those reserves so you can go harder and recover quicker. That’s why athletes and gym bros love it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some key studies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kreider et al. (2017) did a massive review of creatine’s safety and found no evidence that creatine harms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28615996/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;kidney &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;function in healthy individuals, even with long-term use (up to 5 years in some studies). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2011 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20976468/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;by Gualano et al., healthy adults took creatine for 21 months with no changes in kidney markers or function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They concluded it’s safe for long-term use in healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2004 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12850845_Long-term_oral_creatine_supplementation_does_not_impair_renal_function_in_healthy_athletes" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Poortmans &amp;amp; Francaux) also showed no negative kidney effects after 5 years of daily creatine in athletes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your kidneys start out healthy, creatine itself doesn’t seem to cause damage or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But who shouldn’t go all in without thinking?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s not pretend it’s magic dust for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already have kidney issues? Creatine could be a bit of a red flag. Your kidneys filter creatinine (a byproduct of creatine), so if they’re already not at their best, adding extra strain isn’t ideal. Always talk to your doc before starting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overdoing it? The sweet spot is around 3–5 grams per day (after a loading phase if you’re doing one). Mega-dosing, stacking it with other random supplements, or not following instructions? That’s a no-go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not drinking enough water? Creatine pulls water into your muscles. If you’re not hydrating properly, it could put pressure on your kidneys—especially during sweaty workouts. Water is your best friend here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want to play it safe? Here’s your game plan:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a kidney function test before you start, especially if you’re over 40 or have health issues like diabetes or high BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stick to the recommended dose—3 to 5 grams per day. That’s enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrate like it’s your job, especially before and after workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice anything weird—like swelling, peeing less, or feeling drained for no reason? Don’t ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t mix creatine with meds or other stuff that stresses your kidneys (like NSAIDs) unless your doc gives you the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, is creatine safe?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy folks—yes. Creatine is one of the most researched supplements out there, and there’s no solid proof that it causes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-creatine/art-20347591#:~:text=While%20taking%20creatine%20might%20not,kidney%20function%20in%20healthy%20people." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;kidney &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;damage in people with normal kidney function.

              &lt;p&gt;When you think of longevity in animals, chances are that the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-400-year-old-shark-may-hold-the-cure-to-aging-1785144189"&gt;Greenland shark&lt;/a&gt; will immediately come up. After all, researchers &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/greenland-shark.html"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that the enigmatic animal can live for &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 250 years. It turns out, however, that bats also hold their own when it comes to lifespan, with some species living up to 25 years—equivalent to 180 human years—and they tend to do it cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Rochester (UR) have investigated anti-cancer “superpowers,” as described in a UR &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/why-dont-bats-get-cancer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, in four bat species: the little brown bat, the big brown bat, the cave nectar bat, and the Jamaican fruit bat. The results of their investigation could have important implications for treating cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Longer lifespans with more cell divisions, and longer exposure to exo- [external] and endogenous [internal] stressors increase cancer incidence,” the researchers wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59403-z"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal Nature Communications. “However, despite their exceptional lifespans, few to no tumors have been reported in long-lived wild and captive populations of bats.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Led by biologists Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov from the UR Department of Biology and Wilmot Cancer Institute, the team identified a number of biological defenses that help bats avoid the disease. For example, bats have a tumor-suppressor gene, called p53. Specifically, little brown bats carry two copies of the gene, and have high p53 activity, which can get rid of cancer cells during &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/apoptosis#:~:text=Apoptosis%20is%20the%20process%20of,a%20role%20in%20preventing%20cancer."&gt;apoptosis,&lt;/a&gt; a biological process that eliminates unwanted cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that some bat species have evolved enhanced p53 activity as an additional anti-cancer strategy, similar to elephants,” the researchers explained. Too much p53, though, runs the risk of killing too many cells. Clearly, bats are able to find the right apoptosis balance. Humans also have p53, but mutations in the gene—which disrupt its anti-cancer properties—exist in around 50% of human cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed the enzyme telomerase. In bats, the telomerase expression allows bat cells to multiply endlessly. That means they don’t undergo replicative senescence: a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804996000585"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; that restricts cell proliferation to a certain number of divisions. Since, according to the study, senescence “promotes age-related inflammation contributing to the aging process,” bats’ lack thereof would seem to promote longevity. And while indefinite cell proliferation might sound like the perfect cancer hotbed, bats’ high p53 activity can kill off any cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “bats have unique immune systems which allows them to survive a wide range of deadly viruses, and many unique immune adaptations have been described in bats,” the researchers wrote. “Most knowledge of the bat immune systems comes from studies of bat tolerance to viral infections deadly to humans. However, these or similar immune adaptations may also recognize and eliminate tumors,” as well as “temper inflammation, which may have an anticancer effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cells have to go through several steps, or “oncogenic hits,” to become harmful cancerous cells. Surprisingly, the researchers also found that it only takes two hits for normal bat cells to become malignant, meaning bats aren’t naturally resistant to cancer—they just have “robust tumor-suppressor mechanisms,” as described in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings carry important implications for treating cancer. Specifically, the study confirms that increased p53 activity—which is already targeted by some anti-cancer drugs—can eliminate or slow cancer growth. More broadly, their research is yet another example of scientists turning to nature for solutions to human &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-tiny-robot-is-part-bee-part-crane-fly-and-it-finally-has-solid-legs-2000591586"&gt;challenges on all scales&lt;/a&gt;. Though the study focuses on bats, the ultimate aim is, always, finding a cure for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melissa Bullock, Nevada State Medical Epidemiologist, told local 2 News Nevada: 'We urge people to be aware of any signs of rodent activity and to take precautions to reduce the risk of exposure to hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Anyone who has been in contact with rodents, nests or droppings and subsequently develops symptoms consistent with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome should see a health care provider immediately.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No details are known about the two people who have tested positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To reduce risk of exposure, state health officials recommend airing out spaces where mice droppings could be, avoid sweeping droppings, use disinfectant and wipe up debris, and wear gloves and a mask. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses are a group of viruses found worldwide that are &lt;span&gt;spread to people when they inhale aerosolized fecal matter, urine, or saliva from infected rodents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rarity of hantavirus in the US is partly because the country has fewer rodent species that the illness can circulate amongst, compared to Asia and Europe, where multiple rodent species act as hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-84933260-478f-11f0-b334-8beb2a687d4a" class=""&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Tech researchers found that while deer mice are still the primary reservoir for hantaviruses in North America, the virus is now circulating more widely than previously thought, with antibodies detected in six additional rodent species where they had not been documented before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Virginia Tech team &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/04/hantavirus-environmental-factors-influence-distribution-paanwaris-paansri-luis-escobar.html"&gt;analyzed data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network to better understand how hantavirus spreads in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2014 and 2019, the program gathered and tested 14,004 blood samples from 49 different mouse species at 45 locations across the US to test for levels of hantavirus antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Debbie Zipperian, from Montana, survived Hantavirus after being diagnosed with the disease at 46.

&lt;p&gt;An active compound in ginger root may inhibit the growth of cancer tumors via a sabotage of their metabolic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in Nature Scientific Reports by a team at Osaka Metropolitan University (OMU), the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-00131-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that a ginger-derived molecule known as EMC shuts down the cells’ fat-making machinery, causing it to activate backup systems and potentially become vulnerable to detection or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a century of serious innovation and research into cancer and its prevention and treatment, we still don’t fully understand a cancer tumor’s diet so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cancer’s key characteristic is its ability to reprogram normal energy metabolism to sustain the uncontrolled proliferation that allows it to spread through the organism. This leads to distinct metabolic traits compared to normal cells, among which has been the nearly 100-year-old supposition that cancers rely on glycolysis for primary energy production—an observation known as the Warburg effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For readers who remembered their high school biology textbook, glycolysis is the process of turning stored energy (glycogen) into available energy (glucose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note however that cancer metabolism is subject to ongoing research, and they themselves present in their paper evidence of cancer cells relying on &lt;em&gt;de novo &lt;/em&gt;fatty acid synthesis to sustain their growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolically speaking, fatty acids produce more energy per molecule than sugars, but instead of using fatty acids from food, the cancer cells produce their own, hence the Latin descriptor “&lt;em&gt;de novo,&lt;/em&gt;” or “of new creation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Akiko Kojima-Yuasa at OMU, analyzed ethyl p-methoxycinnamate or EMC, a main component of kencur ginger, found commonly in Indonesian, Chinese, and Thai cuisine, for an inhibitory effect on cancer cells—something which his team had previously uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, the team was specifically hoping to see if its inhibitory effect was related to cancer metabolism. Results revealed that the acid ester inhibits energy production by disrupting &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; fatty acid synthesis and fat metabolism, rather than through glycolysis as commonly theorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the researchers discovered application of the EMC triggered increased glycolysis, which they supposed was a survival mechanism in the cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOOD AS MEDICINE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Manuka Honey Reduces Breast Cancer Cell Growth by 84% in Human Cells and Mice" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/manuka-honey-reduces-breast-cancer-cell-growth-by-84-in-human-cells-and-mice/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Manuka Honey Reduces Breast Cancer Cell Growth by 84% in Human Cells and Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings not only provide new insights that supplement and expand the theory of the Warburg effect, which can be considered the starting point of cancer metabolism research, but are also expected to lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of new treatment methods,” stated Professor Kojima-Yuasa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cell-cycle checkpoint is a moment in the life cycle of a cell when, following a period of growth and DNA synthesis, a control mechanism determines whether to further grow the cell or terminate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE GOOD FOOD: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Keep Out All the Christmas Spices – They’re Powerful Antioxidants Known as ‘Nutraceuticals’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/christmas-spices-are-powerful-antioxidants-known-as-nutraceuticals/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Keep Out All the Christmas Spices – They’re Powerful Antioxidants Known as ‘Nutraceuticals’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancers need tremendous energy to fuel their growth, and the authors write that when conditions of an energy deficit are detected at a cell-cycle checkpoint, it’s a common red flag that can lead to the cell cycle being arrested or terminated altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knocking out the primary method of energy generation may help highlight an energy deficit at a cell-cycle checkpoint during the early stages of malignancy, though this was not investigated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

The primate center is located in Hillsboro, about 8 miles from St. Vincent on Portland’s westside. OHSU’s main hospital is 12 miles from the primate center, making for longer drive times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The primate center has been under fire lately as activists seek to close it and the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2025/05/02/national-institutes-of-health-cuts-back-on-animal-experiments-in-plan-likely-to-hurt-ohsu/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;cuts back&lt;/a&gt; on medical research on animals.

Every exposure is now an institutional emergency that OHSU must manage without its longtime external partner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/sites/default/files/2019-04/Biohazard%20Notice.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;biohazard notice&lt;/a&gt; about working with macaques at the primate center, OHSU says: “All fresh or frozen samples of tissue or fluids from nonhuman primates are potentially contaminated with pathogens that may be infectious to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="169550"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those pathogens may include herpes B, also known as “monkey B virus,” the notice says. Monkey virus B is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/herpes-b-virus/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;“extremely rare,”&lt;/a&gt; according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it can lead to “severe” brain damage and death if not treated immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Herpes B is, in many ways, the occupational bogeyman of the primate research industry,” Jones-Engel said. “Not because it’s common in humans, but because the consequences are catastrophic when protocols fail. That’s why national primate centers are obligated to maintain immediate access to specialized infectious disease expertise, not simply as a best practice, but as a core requirement for NIH funding, AAALAC accreditation, and OSHA compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The AAALAC is the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The Occupational Health leadership team is reviewing options with [primate center] leadership, OHSU risk management, and the biosafety team,” the memo to workers says. “All involved parties are deeply committed to ensuring that exposed employees receive expert and timely medical evaluation and management. We will continue to update you as we establish a new plan to maintain this essential service.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;div class="b-text-button-cta"&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Willamette Week’s reporting has concrete impacts that change laws, force action from civic leaders, and drive compromised politicians from public office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help us dig deeper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Willamette Week</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 13:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxORTFjeDVFTUdfR09fbW5WTDAta0U5Umh0alZkR25kM1YtMmRJTkptOGV1QzF2Z2F6SUpCRmlSTHBadWlSX1BWZFV6MjNuQ0JtSGFiSFA1TEtpUWlZX1RoOGlMdDRyT090RTZOVWRJazYybENtelBGRlNnMHBPbm9LYWZ3ekV2R3NodEZ4al9KZmZlSFhZRU1WUVZQQnZJU1hKTjhHX2NRRjBGSVZ6a3RtLUJTN2I4NkgyLWxJS3NKM2l0U3pqLWdKV01KdTY2WmxkQ3N5XzVwWQ</guid></item><item><title>俄亥俄州中部女性与严重的非酒精性脂肪性肝病作斗争- 10TV | Central Ohio woman battles severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease - 10TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6gFBVV95cUxOR3plZHYyWGxxemp3bUZaQkhINHpsc3ZjM3NjcU4xMkM5cG1wRUpFa1FZdGhCLXBOSERfSkIyaXNfRDBsMXZxOVRGVU1wQTRBM2FFUFpCYldZYS1jRHlpOGxJNXpjZUQ3bkppVHQ2T0U3eE9wbjdOcFhub0VVUzFZVEt3c0hwZ0FkYnl3N0NvUGtLNGVhSXpabHVCOWVGazcxdnBXbVhfNDBPaEp3a2UzMFl2NnBRYndIYmxIQTdhZ1ZWTFNFNF9rbWRFNHRmRGFlV1RjbWZRYVZZZ2R2OUN5WHR1UzRlMUNwQnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Once considered a niche concern, it is now a growing global epidemic affecting more than one in four adults worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — Global Fatty Liver Day is observed on June 12, and there is a growing effort to raise awareness on what is described as one of the most underdiagnosed and misunderstood health threats: fatty liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once considered a niche concern, it is now a growing global epidemic affecting more than one in four adults worldwide, according to recent estimates by the Global Liver Institute.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They looked at the biopsy, they ran several other tests, and that's when he said there is no cure,” Pam Miller said that is what doctors told her when she was diagnosed in 2001.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have approximately six years to live. Hopefully, they'll have a cure by then.”  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller’s fatty liver disease was at Stage Four, and there is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has led to approved medications specifically for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH], and several promising drugs are now in late-stage trials, offering hope to millions.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller shared that she participates in clinical trials at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'm helping my children and my grandchildren and everybody to come,” she said. “They watch you really closely, and so I'm thankful for all my doctors and stuff that have kept me here.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD], often flies under the radar. Many people with NAFLD have no symptoms—until the condition advances to its more severe form, NASH, which can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis or even liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical experts advise that fatty liver disease is preventable. Risk factors include obesity, insulin resistance, high cholesterol, and sedentary lifestyles, all of which are on the rise globally. But the lack of public awareness, routine screening, and even medical training around NAFLD has created a gap in both prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the statistics are sobering, experts remain hopeful. Fatty liver disease, particularly in its early stages, is reversible. A combination of modest weight loss, healthy eating, and regular physical activity can significantly improve liver health, sometimes in just a few months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The mechanisms behind this protective effect are multifaceted: exercise helps maintain a healthy weight, which is crucial as obesity is a major cancer risk factor; it can improve immune system function and reduce chronic inflammation; it helps regulate hormones like insulin and estrogen, which can influence cancer cell growth; and it can speed up the passage of food through the digestive system, thereby reducing exposure to potential carcinogens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 12:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxQWVRSOEFyb0VrZ1JkZjZ0NHlYU3FxTmxHOFhWZXRLT2pJWGQwM1BqNHdhZEJrYlJUQjRkd1lIQ3dGaEJiRDFNSUNJM3F6c2JyMlJicGZ2TGxqX0FEcFVnS3Z0OGZ0bWYwN3d4TDFxT1Bxa2dfWlUwM0lWLTBPWVdURGhUbWQweW05R2c2b0hfMER6a2lmeEcyMEstaEVvQVFnRDFGVXFwaVRzNVZjeWlzMk1xTmZ5ZkoydkhNUlIzSnBTbVRIcldhTG5tOHFjZy1TXzMzZUZQRFU0dy1mQlgzRWZyVmU0WTlnbmRxX1FrU1pDZ3NqRFE</guid></item><item><title>新的联邦新冠疫苗政策已经阻止了一些人接种疫苗- CNN | New federal Covid-19 vaccine policies are already keeping some people from getting shots - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE9GMXpBNl9sUks3eDloX2FUWjNWc2J4VlhOQlNQYXNYdTcxaE1JeGJoakxKM1c1YkQ4R1lKMTU3cFk4c0ZBbXVDUjFwcUMwZGxNZHRkQ29GV1BkNUdFVmpyZDA3a2UySVVhdjUyS1pTNFYyaW5a0gF6QVVfeXFMTXdSdDdvOWF1dTJyakNoR2FaZV9rSU9tTDBTTTZrMDVPUGNxeFE2TnV4d0dDYmlBWlk5YlVKcGl3MnAwbmRsNlctOWRMTlpvX3Vpa2MyUm4weUNJcHZOdUtaYjhhem02WDFHeENkT0szWkZjSzYzZ1NsX1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqugrzg00003b6mbf4z3sbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After federal health officials made abrupt changes to US Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for pregnant women last month, there’s new confusion and uncertainty about who can get the shots — and some reports that patients were turned away when they tried to get vaccinated. Now, 30 health and medical organizations are pushing for continued access and insurance coverage for the vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbscxx7e00003b6mp43rhg63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” wrote the organizations – including major professional groups for obstetricians, primary care providers, pediatricians, pharmacists and nurses – in an &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/open-letter-urging-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-in-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;. “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsd1wn600043b6mvytypov3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter calls on “payers and insurers to continue making the COVID-19 vaccine available to pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” even though the shots have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/children-covid-vaccine-cdc"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from the list of vaccines recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdl8q0000u3b6mowt6zqwb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl84cg300033b6mbkyz85t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter comes two weeks after US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly announced that the Covid-19 vaccine, which has shown to be safe and effective during pregnancy, would no longer be recommended for pregnant people. Leaders from the US Food and Drug Administration also recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/health/covid-vaccine-fda-changes"&gt;outlined a new framework&lt;/a&gt; for the approval process for Covid-19 vaccines that could limit shots to older Americans and people at higher risk of serious Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbpcp37q00093b6mkqoefzuz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts immediately warned that these changes could create new barriers to vaccines for those who want them, including confusion around who is eligible and higher costs for patients if insurance no longer covers them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsd53se000a3b6mfly4ftvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Pharmacists Association, which signed on to the open letter, said it has already received reports of patients being denied Covid-19 vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsaea0a00013b6mstltfjh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Leigh Haldeman, 33, a nurse at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle who is pregnant, told CNN that she tried twice to get vaccinated last week and was turned away.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700023b6mbddydesb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because of some complications I had during my first pregnancy, getting the vaccine now and getting that extra boost of immunity would be definitely important for me,” said Haldeman, who got her last shot in the fall of 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700033b6mxthdq0su@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At two different pharmacies, she was told it is not recommended for pregnant women to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, based on new guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdm1jf000z3b6m8gg8w3ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She still hasn’t been able to get the shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdi047000o3b6m7lj8nde5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors still strongly recommend Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdi6of000r3b6moejwt88y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement. “It is very clear that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants after birth.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdola800153b6mr7a7auym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After an appointment last week, Haldeman agreed with her obstetrician’s advice to get an additional Covid-19 shot during her pregnancy. Her first try was a Walgreens store where she had an appointment to get the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700053b6mafo0n2v5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I went through the whole check-in process, and then as soon as the pharmacist saw that I was pregnant, they were like, ‘We cannot give this to you,’ ” she recounted. “ ‘We’re only giving it to immunocompromised people right now.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700063b6mvqvbp203@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she asked whether she was considered immunocompromised because she’s pregnant. Haldeman said the pharmacist responded that guidelines have changed, that it’s not recommended and they wouldn’t give it to her.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblbowqg00233b6m3ewml3p2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She then called her primary care provider and obstetrician, but neither had the vaccine in stock. In past years, pharmacies have administered the majority of Covid-19 shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700083b6mi0ylrw17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Walgreens spokesperson told CNN, “We continue to closely monitor and review all federal and state guidance related to vaccines. As regulations and recommendations evolve, we remain committed to ensuring our pharmacy teams have the latest information to support patient care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700093b6maymyx5kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Haldeman said her obstetrician suggested trying another pharmacy. She called a Safeway and asked, “I’m 25 weeks pregnant. My provider is recommending that I get this Covid booster. Are you able to give that to me?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000b3b6mmlz4qb3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The immediate answer was no.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000c3b6mv455mlpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m under the impression from my provider that I need to get this,” she recalled saying. “Pharmacies are the only people that appear to have it right now. What do I need to do to get this vaccine?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsec9m4001d3b6m7m2s3j23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the pharmacist told her, “The guidelines have changed as of last Friday. We can’t give it to you.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsopzr200033b6m5z28thpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pharmacist suggested that Haldeman try getting a prescription for the vaccine from her provider so the pharmacy might be able to administer it. Her obstetrician wrote a vaccination prescription and sent it to the Safeway pharmacy, but when Haldeman visited the location at 7 p.m. the same day, she was told the pharmacy hadn’t received the prescription.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblcex8x00003b6mq0hz836s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a statement from a company spokesperson, Safeway parent company Albertsons told CNN, “In accordance with recently updated CDC guidance, we adjusted our COVID-19 vaccination policies. Pregnant individuals with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness remain eligible for vaccination. We encourage all customers to consult with their healthcare providers for personalized advice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbtb0cra00003b6m3iojy2xj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The lack of clarity left Haldeman frustrated and uncertain about what to do next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000g3b6mgleulsou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I spent half my day on this. … Most people are probably not going to go to those lengths to get the vaccine. The more hoops that you make people jump through, less and less people are just going to get vaccinated,” Haldeman said. “And we know that having Covid during pregnancy does terrible things to your placenta, and certainly reducing that risk is worth it. So it’s very frustrating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbs98lzq00023b6m9uavkgs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Pharmacists Association &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacist.com/APhA-Press-Releases/apha-withholds-endorsement-of-acip-adult-immunization-schedule" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a news release that the updates to the Covid-19 recommendations “do not appear to be based on the scientific evidence provided over the past few years. … COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been proven safe and effective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl8r7qf001d3b6mpe37lqi6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, pharmacists “may face consequences if they do not follow the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or CDC recommendations,” said Allison Hill, the association’s director of professional affairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblafeuc001l3b6mmeqxlhtk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS’s and CDC’s recent changes to the Covid-19 recommendations create barriers and confusion,” Hill said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbs9wmg600083b6mm8g75av9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS’s unusual updates to the Covid-19 vaccine schedules were followed this week by a sweeping change to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the independent experts who typically guide the agency on its vaccine recommendations. Kennedy bypassed ACIP in making the Covid-19 changes and then &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; this week that he had dismissed the entire 17-member panel. On Wednesday, Kennedy announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/kennedy-new-members-vaccine-advisory-panel"&gt;eight new members&lt;/a&gt; to ACIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The removal of the vaccine advisers sparked a swift backlash from health care providers and professional organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqn9voh00023b6mq8hpgvnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, another organization that signed the open letter, said that undermining the integrity of ACIP is “completely unfounded” and has “a significant negative impact on Americans of all ages.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqxzjed00003b6my4oc7j4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pharmacists association said&lt;a href="https://www.pharmacist.com/APhA-Press-Releases/apha-alarmed-by-elimination-of-acip-voting-membership" target="_blank"&gt; Tuesday,&lt;/a&gt; “It is highly concerning that removing 17 scientists overnight eliminates the historical knowledge, scientific training, and clinical expertise required to equip pharmacists and the public to make appropriate choices for health based upon the risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsesdv6001j3b6mnv34ptkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since Kennedy announced changes to the Covid-19 vaccine schedule, doctors said they’re worried about their patients and the future of vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbse8c8800183b6mbtavqvkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement. “We are concerned about access implications and what this recommendation will mean for insurance coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine for those who do choose to get vaccinated during pregnancy. And as ob-gyns, we are very concerned about the potential deterioration of vaccine confidence in the future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsba5xu000v3b6m5m1dvcgu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37763105/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that infants who are born after a Covid-19 infection during pregnancy are at increased risk of stillbirth, respiratory distress and low birth weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblcsse300013b6mftu19cbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With maternal health being compromised, you have the risk for preterm delivery, babies that are born very small or potentially even fetal loss early on,” Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, an associate professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at Baylor College of Medicine, said last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000l3b6mu1q0pt0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. John Lynch, an associate medical director at the Harborview Medical Center and a colleague of Haldeman’s, said Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy also has benefits for the newborn.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000m3b6mlim1uks1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccinating a mom leads to the protection of the baby when they don’t have their own immune response,” Lynch said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000n3b6mu7wra39p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the Covid vaccine is not available to babies younger than 6 months, vaccinating the mother may be the safest way for young children to gain some immunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000o3b6mqyy7pu6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That first year of life remains the highest period of risk, and this is a vaccine-preventable disease,” Muñoz said. “We can modify the outcomes for these babies through maternal vaccination and through infant vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

It can be exciting, scary, painful, messy, embarrassing, or all of the above. And though the adults in your life can help you prepare for and understand what’s happening, they can’t do much to predict or control it when it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Except that now, &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/moms-are-trying-delay-daughters-first-period-experts-say-theyre-right-2075902"&gt;some parents&lt;/a&gt; are trying to take a more active role. “Delaying my daughter’s first period is a goal I have in motherhood,” Nicky Skinner, a nurse and health coach, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJTAoZxzVSk/?hl=en"&gt;wrote on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; last month. Skinner has been concerned for years about the effects of certain chemicals on girls’ puberty, she told me in an email. Now that she’s a mom to a 4- and 7-year-old, she’s working to eliminate those chemicals from their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Her post, which got more than 70,000 likes, is one of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI98Is-TP4G/?igsh=ZjM5MmYwdmh3Z2Ez"&gt;a few&lt;/a&gt; offering tips on pushing back the onset of menstruation (also called menarche), often involving changes to diet, personal care products, and even screen time. The parents involved are responding to a nationwide trend: The average age of menarche in the US &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/31/nx-s1-4985074/girls-are-getting-their-first-periods-earlier-heres-what-parents-should-know"&gt;has shifted earlier&lt;/a&gt;, from 12.5 between 1950 and 1969 to 11.9 between 2000 and 2005, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819141"&gt;according to a 2024 study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The percentage of kids who get their first period before age 9 is also on the rise, more than doubling between the 1950s and the 2000s. Researchers are concerned about these trends because getting a first period earlier is associated with an increased risk of some health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/well/live/girls-period-menstrual-cycle-study.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has weighed in on the matter, &lt;a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-kennedy-sperm-testosterone-teens-fox-b2737911.html"&gt;claiming in an April appearance&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News that “girls are hitting puberty six years early.” He appeared to link the issue to children’s diets, arguing that “the food our kids are eating today is not really food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But experts say the shift toward earlier periods likely stems from a variety of factors, including increased nutrition, higher body weight, stress, and environmental influences. Researchers are particularly concerned about the impact of chemicals called endocrine disruptors, which can mimic the activity of hormones in the body, said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/shruthi-mahalingaiah/"&gt;Shruthi Mahalingaiah&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of environmental, reproductive, and women’s health at Harvard University. These chemicals include &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/well/phthalates-heart-disease.html"&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, which can be present in shampoos, lotions, and other common products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some experts say it makes sense for parents to try to limit kids’ exposure to endocrine disruptors, but it’s impossible to avoid these compounds completely. And some say that expecting families to reverse a large-scale health trend — especially one involving something as intimate as menstruation — forces parents to become hypervigilant and could even put their kids at risk of eating disorders. “I definitely don’t think that it should be on individual parents to save their daughters from this possibly overblown idea of early menarche being a problem,” Christy Harrison, a registered dietitian and host of the podcast &lt;a href="https://rethinkingwellness.substack.com/podcast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rethinking Wellness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-earlier-periods-could-be-a-problem" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why earlier periods could be a problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Experts are worried about the shift toward earlier menstruation because an earlier age at first period is linked with a variety of health risks, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/31/nx-s1-4985074/girls-are-getting-their-first-periods-earlier-heres-what-parents-should-know"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and several reproductive cancers. Some research also suggests an increased risk of anxiety and depression, &lt;a href="https://appointments.childrensnational.org/provider/roopa-kanakatti-shankar/2359824"&gt;Roopa Kanakatti Shankar&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Getting a period at a younger age than their peers can also be stressful for kids. “Physically, they are reaching an adult-like state, but the cognitive development is still ongoing,” Shankar said. Managing the mechanics of pads, tampons, and tracking your cycle can be more difficult for younger kids, Mahalingaiah said (honestly, it remains a challenge for some adults). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Younger children may have a harder time handling the mood shifts that can come with the menstrual cycle, Shankar said. Girls who go through puberty earlier are also more likely to experience sexual harassment, according to &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272431614568198"&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For these reasons (and others), creators like Skinner, who lives in New Zealand, are taking matters into their own hands. “The idea of delaying my daughter’s first period (menarche) as long as naturally possible isn’t about artificially controlling or fearing puberty — it’s about supporting long-term health and well-being in the face of modern environmental stressors,” she writes in her Instagram post, inviting readers to comment “DAUGHTER hormone support checklist” to learn more. Skinner &lt;a href="https://stan.store/nourished_and_vibrant?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAacwnZAdZs6bB7hULDJpeefZcmb0Bjfy0Fieus6o3C77xDhHl1YZhHYY66dWeA_aem_ffA5hxKfKcBqKtjOI_hLGA"&gt;also offers&lt;/a&gt; a variety of health coaching and “low tox” education services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Skinner clarified to me that “it’s not about ‘delaying’ their period,” but rather “creating an environment for them that doesn’t bring it on prematurely.” For her, that includes “eliminating personal care products with synthetic fragrance chemicals as well as swapping to glass and stainless steel in the kitchen in place of plastic.” She also focuses on feeding her kids “whole, real, and homemade food” about 80 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Bec Kinderman, a mom of four and homebirth advocate living in Australia, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI98Is-TP4G/?igsh=ZjM5MmYwdmh3Z2Ez"&gt;posted a similar message&lt;/a&gt; in April: “Let’s normalize pre teen girls being young, enjoying playgrounds and slowing down the onset of puberty.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kinderman, who did not respond to Vox’s request for comment, goes on to advise that parents choose whole foods over “convenience foods” that are “loaded up on seed oils and artificial ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“While as parents we can’t control everything in our child’s environment &amp;amp; their life experiences &amp;amp; circumstances, there are things we can do to try to minimize these concerns,” Kinderman writes, in a post that received over 60,000 likes. “I will be daring and say that household toxins and diet are NUMBER ONE.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="can-parents-control-kids-periods" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Can parents control kids’ periods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Several experts told me it’s reasonable for parents to try to limit endocrine-disrupting chemicals in their homes, such as by avoiding unnecessary fragrances or choosing safer cleaning products. “If you have the knowledge that you have a product that has these endocrine disruptors, and there is an alternative, to me it is reasonable to choose the one that doesn’t,” Aviva Sopher, a pediatric endocrinologist at Columbia University, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;However, Sopher said, it’s impossible to completely avoid these chemicals because they also occur outside the home, such as in products used on lawns and gardens. Products made without phthalates and other endocrine disruptors can also be more costly, making it harder for lower-income families to avoid them, Sopher added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, trying to influence the timing of a child’s period through diet could have unintended consequences, some say. “One of the biggest problems that can cause delayed menarche is disordered eating,” Harrison said. Indeed, a very late first period, like a very early one, is associated with health risks, possibly because of links with eating disorders, Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I worry that the goal of delaying girls’ periods unintentionally encourages restricting their eating, and also potentially masks the signs of disordered eating,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Banning all processed foods from the home could also backfire. Kids who never have access to such foods often binge when they do encounter them, Harrison said: “I see that so often in kids who are restricted and deprived of sugar or snack foods, where they end up going to friends’ houses and just like staying around the snack drawer the whole time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s worth noting, also, that real concerns around endocrine disruptors can sometimes exist alongside health misinformation. Kennedy, for example, has &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-claims-teenage-boys-113340103.html"&gt;discussed early puberty&lt;/a&gt; while also making misleading claims about &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-again-claims-autism-032802120.html"&gt;the dangers of Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and his ability to &lt;a href="/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning"&gt;find the “cause” of autism&lt;/a&gt; within a year. And seed oils, mentioned by Kinderman, are not associated with early puberty and are actually beneficial for health, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html"&gt;according to nutrition scientists&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://campsite.bio/rebeccakinderman?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAae2RdPbPX3BR7hZdXwem3vKQi2JPjJSGmODLrDKVn_maewCvdOkKoZ0qfx2Pw_aem_HPyDPSaVKwZKXcsGc5A1UQ"&gt;Kinderman’s website&lt;/a&gt; also includes a link to a list of anti-vaccine resources.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Skinner agrees there’s a risk of children developing eating disorders “if parents are too fanatical about ONLY eating ‘good’ foods,” but says her 80–20 approach does not carry such a risk. “In our home we don’t demonize ANY food groups. We talk about how food makes them feel.” She doesn’t want concern about eating disorders to become an “excuse” for parents “not to take ownership for their role” — which, she says, “is to set their child up for the best chance of a healthful life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Others, however, say that placing the onus on families to prevent early menarche puts an “unfair blame and shame on parents, and especially moms,” who are still disproportionately in charge of what kids eat, Harrison said. Scientists still aren’t sure what role endocrine disruptors play in early puberty, and they are difficult to study, even for professionals because they can occur in extremely low amounts that may or may not add up over time, Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Parents who are concerned that their daughters are going through early puberty — defined as breast development beginning before age 8 — should consult a doctor, Shankar said. On a societal level, we need more research into environmental influences on puberty, including endocrine disruptors, she added. Changes to public policy could also encourage companies “to be more aware and more sensitive about what they’re putting into the products that we’re all using,” Sopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Stricter laws around air and water quality could be another way to address environmental factors along with “environmental justice regulations that keep certain groups from being disproportionately impacted by pollution,” Harrison said. (Despite Kennedy’s stated concern about earlier puberty, the Trump administration has actually &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html"&gt;rolled back dozens of laws&lt;/a&gt; around clean air and water.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“To the extent that things in our environment are affecting this trend, it’s on politicians and society,” Harrison said. “At the collective level, we need to make these changes, not put it on the individual.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Gun deaths of children rose in states that loosened gun laws after a 2010 Supreme Court decision, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/health/gun-deaths-children.html"&gt;according to a new study&lt;/a&gt;. In states that kept restrictions in place, deaths remained flat or even decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ice-detained-queens-11th-grader-at-his-immigration-hearing-officials-say"&gt;11th-grade New York City student&lt;/a&gt; was detained by immigration authorities at an asylum hearing last week, school officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Just 45 percent of 7th- to 12th-graders saw college as their most likely next step after high school in 2024, down from 73 percent in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/more-teens-leaning-toward-alternative-postsecondary-options/749798/"&gt;according to a new survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;My older kid and I have discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/51F/the-area-51-files/"&gt;Area 51 Files series&lt;/a&gt;, about a middle-schooler forced to relocate to a top-secret base full of aliens.

We got some responses we weren’t able to include in the final story, and one of my favorites came from a 15-year-old, who hopes to become a mechanic and create a new car “that can save the world (somehow).” As a millennial, I am constantly disappointed by the lack of &lt;a href="https://www.cars.com/articles/let-down-but-not-out-cars-com-research-reveals-millennials-still-upbeat-towards-the-auto-industry-even-without-flying-cars-419114/"&gt;flying cars&lt;/a&gt;, and I look forward to the lifesaving variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As always, you can reach me with questions or story ideas at anna.north@vox.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 11:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE54UmRYNjFZb2FPX0JzX2Zjd01LWVlWTExzR0c5VGRDeFIwQmUyTGRQY2dzUEZMRWhEbFhOdE5uX3dsTlRadE1NQkt3UTNwRXRLcnFsM2JPSEJNc3EtYmtuRWMzb1Vicjk1cEJtQjlpcWpYbERBR1hTYXlHSQ</guid></item><item><title>“Razor Blade Throat”和旅行“Nimbus” ： NB.1.8.1 COVID-19变种是什么？ - IFLScience | “Razor Blade Throat” And A Traveling “Nimbus”: What's Up With The NB.1.8.1 COVID-19 Variant? - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxPVjNJNlU1a1RUTm1zWlFpNDB6UzJwN1hmOGM1MjJNNGhmZFNrSGlFcHFxeVRxVEJJdzllakwyZDZTN0diSXVQQTdOQXRUMHl3RFFlZWZxaXZNTUUwYjRYc05UQjlwd0p2a0xQeTFwUHBmcmpjbDJyd1NUNndxTF9jVHNIdEJpWlZBbTVYckM2ckJTdkxLVDBIZ0ZXUk9XeEtQcmd0WXVjOHoyZmx6a3JMV1Nxb1dnZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;Thought we’d seen the last of it? Sorry to disappoint, but there’s a new COVID-19 variant gallivanting across the globe. Its official title is &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-covid-variant-nb181-detected-amid-big-changes-coming-to-vaccines-in-us-79378" target="_blank"&gt;NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt;, but some have taken to calling it “Nimbus”. In the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season is just starting to ramp up, medics are bracing for a new wave of cases, but that doesn’t mean that we in the north will get off scot-free. So, what kind of symptoms are people reporting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare to experience déjà vu. So far, the symptoms of the Nimbus variant don’t seem to be hugely different from what we’ve seen with all the previous variants. As a member of the Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2 variants, it makes sense that Nimbus would present very similarly to its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;familiar constellation&lt;/a&gt; of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="46" data-end="53"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Cough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="56" data-end="68"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Congestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="71" data-end="82"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Headaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="85" data-end="94"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="97" data-end="110"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Sore throat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="113" data-end="136"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Fever (in some cases)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="139" data-end="174"&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Gastrointestinal symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;, such as &lt;strong&gt;nausea&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;diarrhea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms will vary from person-to-person and also depending on your vaccination status – rest assured that according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO), the most recent round of COVID vaccines should still offer decent protection against the Nimbus variant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing does seem to be a bit different this time around, though. There’s been a &lt;a href="https://san.com/cc/razor-blade-throat-symptom-sparks-search-spike-as-covid-variant-spreads/" target="_blank"&gt;reported surge&lt;/a&gt; in online searches for the term “razor blade throat”, suggesting people are experiencing particularly painful sore throats just now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no guarantee that everyone with respiratory symptoms has COVID. If it’s summer where you are, it could be &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-pollen-bomb-cometh-why-your-hay-fever-is-hitting-earlier-than-ever-74012" target="_blank"&gt;hay fever&lt;/a&gt;, which can be really &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/its-that-time-of-year-again-do-i-have-hay-fever-or-covid-19-75016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;tricky to tell apart&lt;/a&gt; from viral infections. There are also always other viruses circulating besides SARS-CoV-2 – as we said, the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season is just kicking off, and counterintuitive though it may seem, you can catch the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-common-cold-whats-the-latest-on-preventing-and-treating-it-72935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;common cold&lt;/a&gt; at any time of year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive COVID test is the only way to be reasonably sure that that’s what you’ve got. As usual, the advice while you’re sick is to stay away from others as much as possible and consider &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/one-type-of-covid-mask-works-better-than-the-rest-but-any-beats-no-mask-at-all-74759" target="_blank"&gt;wearing a mask&lt;/a&gt; if you have to be in contact with other people. Medicines like paracetamol (acetaminophen) can help relieve symptoms – and as a bonus, we might finally now understand &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/we-may-finally-understand-how-paracetamol-aka-tylenolr-actually-works-79549" target="_blank"&gt;how it actually works&lt;/a&gt;. We’d recommend steering clear of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/sock-onions-and-snail-slime-do-any-weird-cold-remedies-actually-work-77904" target="_blank"&gt;sock onions&lt;/a&gt; though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you have any symptoms that concern you, particularly things like shortness of breath, it’s always best to seek professional medical advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts will continue to closely monitor the virus, including this new variant. In a recent piece for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/theres-a-new-covid-variant-driving-up-infections-a-virologist-explains-what-to-know-about-nb-1-8-1-257552" target="_blank"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, virologist Lara Herrero from Griffith University said there’s some evidence to suggest that Nimbus can spread more easily than earlier variants, but no reason to think it will cause more severe disease overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Its spread has been identified in around 22 countries,” GP Dr Naveed Asif told the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/covid-strain-2025-new-variant-symptoms-uk-b2767036.html" target="_blank"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;, so it is definitely making the rounds. The &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/cases" target="_blank"&gt;latest data from the WHO&lt;/a&gt; at time of writing did show a global increase in cases compared to the previous 28-day period, but we’re still nowhere near the peak of the pandemic before &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/covid-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we’re all old hands at dealing with COVID now, right? Not that we don’t miss the Before Times… so here’s a little gift straight from 2019: scientists once trained rats to play hide and seek, and it made them &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/scientists-taught-rats-to-play-hide-and-seek-and-it-literally-made-them-jump-for-joy-53665" target="_blank"&gt;literally jump for joy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;The content of this article is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Now, a global phase 3 clinical trial has offered the strongest evidence yet. Spanning over a decade and involving nearly 900 patients across six countries, this study focused on colon cancer patients who had completed surgery and chemotherapy. The findings? A structured exercise programme doesn't just help in healing, it may actually tilt the scales in favour of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise can beat cancer: But what’s the truth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a growing belief that physical activity might help in preventing cancer or at least reduce its recurrence. While past studies only hinted at this link, this new phase 3 trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirms it with rigorous data. Patients in the trial who followed a structured exercise routine for three years after chemotherapy saw a 28% lower risk of cancer recurrence and a 37% reduction in overall risk of death, compared to those who only received health advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just another wellness trend—it’s real science changing the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It’s triggering a series of deeply biological responses: boosting metabolism, encouraging beneficial gut bacteria, and repairing the gut lining. This is crucial because a healthy gut barrier helps stop cancer-promoting substances from entering the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise increases the demand for glucose in muscles and organs, which leaves less fuel for potential tumour cells to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also regulates insulin levels, which, when too high, are linked to several cancers including colon, breast and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More than movement: Exercise as an immune ally&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond metabolism, exercise plays another vital role—it strengthens the immune system’s surveillance ability. This means it helps the body spot and destroy rogue cells that could turn cancerous. Think of it as constantly updating the body’s internal security system. Over time, this vigilance can lower the chance of relapse or even new cancers forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

While new medications often get approved for much smaller benefits (and come with toxicity risks), exercise delivered significant survival improvements with relatively mild side effects, mainly muscle-related issues in around 18% of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean exercise can replace drugs, but it can be a game-changing partner. Together, they make a more hostile environment for cancer to grow back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Early Detection Saves Lives: Watch for These Ovarian Cancer Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building a routine that works&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured movement isn’t a one-size-fits-all. For cancer survivors, personalised programmes should be designed by health professionals and adjusted gently over time. A blend of 150 minutes per week of aerobic and strength training, like walking, cycling, or light resistance workouts, is a good goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with a family history of colon cancer, regular physical activity, reduced red meat intake, a fibre-rich diet, and early screenings are essential.

              &lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions that doctors treating colon cancer get is: "What else can I do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since colon cancer starts in the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gut-health-microbiome-trend-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;digestive&lt;/a&gt; tract, the food we put in our bodies is — rightly or wrongly — one of the first places people look, wondering: Is there some food I can eat that will help fight cancer, or some cancer-causing thing I should eliminate from my diet, stat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that how cancer emerges inside a body is quite complex. There isn't usually one single thing a person can do to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attending the world's biggest cancer conference earlier this month, I figured I'd cut through some of the noise out there and ask top colon cancer doctors directly what they generally recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone who specializes in gastrointestinal cancers, says his patients are often hunting for a winning &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/foods-that-boost-brain-health-neuro-nine-list-plants-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;superfood&lt;/a&gt; that can combat colon cancer. He fields questions routinely about the merits of avocados, pine nuts, and other items. Could adding those single items to the grocery cart help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he says he's "doubtful" any single food can really make the difference in cancer recurrence, there are a few well-trodden truths doctors live by. These are backed by reams of study data from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4b94983b-ebb1-4a5c-9746-781a8777426c" data-toc-id="4b94983b-ebb1-4a5c-9746-781a8777426c"&gt;Colon cancer doctors shun the meats and the sweets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still can't say for sure whether there's one specific diet that is best to combat cancer, and especially &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/greek-doctor-how-to-eat-for-health-longevity-on-budget-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;one diet that's best for you&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, people with seemingly &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;"clean" diets do get digestive cancers&lt;/a&gt;, even in their 30s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, these four foods are consistently included in diets that seem to lead to cancer diagnoses later on, so oncologists warn against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="c5be940f-0623-4581-bc7f-9e23ce7f73a1" data-toc-id="c5be940f-0623-4581-bc7f-9e23ce7f73a1"&gt;Red meat&lt;/h3&gt;

She said it's not exactly a new idea that sugar can drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's even data in animal models that fructose can lead to polyps," Cercek told BI. Her latest find opens up new questions about what might be prompting more aggressive cases of young colon cancer. "Is sugar maybe somehow driving and accelerating this process?" Cercek asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="852478cb-bf83-46cd-a33f-05b5ef838cfa" data-toc-id="852478cb-bf83-46cd-a33f-05b5ef838cfa"&gt;Alcohol — especially binge drinking and drinking on an empty stomach&lt;/h3&gt;

                      With alcohol, the dose makes the poison. People who drink more have a higher cancer risk.

            &lt;p&gt;In a very basic sense, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-affects-your-brain-body-cancer-new-science-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; is just fermented sugar, and it seems to carry a lot of the same cancer risks. Additionally, our liver breaks down alcohol into acetaldehyde, a known cancer-causing chemical that can damage DNA. Finally, alcohol dampens nutrient absorption and can kill off good bacteria in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In study after study, alcohol consumption is linked to more colon cancer diagnoses, and in general the more you drink, the greater your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests there might be something especially harmful about binge drinking or drinking on an empty stomach, when it comes to colon cancer. Most cancer doctors are not going to insist you can't enjoy a glass of wine or beer now and then, but they would probably say it's best to have it with a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1835dd34-a7e4-4192-a4f7-8e192acd04c8" data-toc-id="1835dd34-a7e4-4192-a4f7-8e192acd04c8"&gt;Colon cancer doctors love greens and a morning cuppa Joe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling hopeless now, buck up!

            &lt;p&gt;Fiber has a reputation for being great at keeping folks full and regular. But that's not all that it does. It also picks up debris in your gut, helping clear out the junk, and dropping off good guy bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why Dr. Pashtoon Kasi, a medical oncologist at City of Hope who specializes in GI cancers, said it's "not just fiber for fiber's sake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says it's underappreciated how fiber is "ameliorating or modulating the microbiome" in ways that may help prevent cancer in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="83a93601-d732-401c-b610-278b571dc9cd" data-toc-id="83a93601-d732-401c-b610-278b571dc9cd"&gt;Coffee (without sugar)&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;"Coffee comes up in every study," Oberstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great news for him personally, because he runs on the stuff. (But he says you don't need to feel pressured to start drinking coffee if you don't enjoy it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be something deeply beneficial about the anti-inflammatory properties of coffee. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/should-drink-coffee-prevent-colorectal-cancer" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that coffee isn't just good at preventing colon cancer (in one study, coffee drinkers had roughly 26% lower odds of contracting colon cancer) — people with colon cancer diagnoses who drink several cups of coffee a day also lower their odds of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="aa70bb29-1cd0-4d15-a71c-55ffd591081f" data-toc-id="aa70bb29-1cd0-4d15-a71c-55ffd591081f"&gt;The takeaway: add veggies and beans in where you can&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;If you're looking for more widespread dietary advice, the National Comprehensive Cancer Care network guidelines for colon cancer patients recommend sticking to a "low glycemic load" diet, which means choosing more foods that are slow to digest and pack a fiber-rich punch. Low-glycemic foods include all kinds of fruits, veggies, nuts, beans, and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kimmie Ng, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber, where she is the founding director of the young-onset colorectal cancer center, says her recommendations fit this basic framework:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A diet less in red meat and processed foods and more in healthy proteins and fruits and vegetables is generally what we recommend," she told BI. "We know that that's typically anti-inflammatory and just healthier overall for a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disease name: &lt;/strong&gt;Werner syndrome, sometimes called "adult progeria"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected populations: &lt;/strong&gt;Werner syndrome is estimated to affect &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507797/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507797/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1 in 100,000 live births&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, though its prevalence varies among countries. In Japan, the syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 20,000 people, whereas the prevalence in the United States is around 1 in 200,000. This difference between locations is partly attributed to "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Founder-Effect" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Founder-Effect" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;founder effects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" — instances where genetic variation declines after a small group of individuals gets separated from a larger population. This limits the gene pool and can cause disease-causing mutations to become more widespread within a population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Werner syndrome affects males and females at equal rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causes:&lt;/strong&gt; Werner syndrome is caused by mutations in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/wrn/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/wrn/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WRN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gene, which is needed to make the so-called Werner protein. This crucial enzyme unwinds and separates the two strands of a DNA molecule and also removes bits of damaged DNA. This helps cells to repair their DNA following damage, make copies of their DNA as they multiply and use the genetic instructions to make proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enzyme may also help maintain &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/telomeres-aging-and-cancer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/telomeres-aging-and-cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;telomeres&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the protective "caps" at the ends of DNA molecules that prevent them from unraveling like frayed shoelaces. Telomeres get shorter with age, and the rate at which they shorten is tied to the rate of biological aging observed and expected lifespan of an organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/werner-syndrome/#causes" target="_blank" data-url="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/werner-syndrome/#causes" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;More than 80 different mutations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the WRN gene have been found in people with Werner syndrome. Most often, such mutations cause cells to make a version of the Werner protein that's too short and doesn't work. The exact consequences of this aren't fully understood, but laboratory studies suggest that cells carrying these mutations can't divide as many times as cells without the mutations can. They also enter &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/zombie-cells-heal-tissues" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/zombie-cells-heal-tissues"&gt;&lt;u&gt;senescence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a zombie-like state associated with cellular aging — earlier than healthy cells do. Additionally, mutations in WRN may prevent cells from correcting DNA damage, allowing other, harmful mutations to accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning it's caused by a person inheriting two broken copies of the WRN gene — one from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rvqfYwZHNEUEnAEuWtzwta" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rvqfYwZHNEUEnAEuWtzwta slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/werner-syndrome/#symptoms" target="_blank" data-url="https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/werner-syndrome/#symptoms" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;symptoms of Werner syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; typically start to emerge in the second decade of life, around adolescence. Children with Werner syndrome are often thin and have a slow growth rate later in childhood, sometimes missing the usual growth spurt seen in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with the syndrome may start growing gray hair before age 20. By 25, they start to lose hair from the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes, and they may grow only sparse hair elsewhere on the body, including the underarms and chest. This lack of hair is likely related to hypogonadism, in which the ovaries or testes don't work well; hypogonadism also undermines the development of sexual organs and the regularity of menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/werner-syndrome#symptoms-and-causes" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/werner-syndrome#symptoms-and-causes" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Werner syndrome also causes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; people to lose the layer of fat beneath the skin, along with muscle mass and bone density. Atrophy of the vocal cords causes many people to develop a high-pitched, squeaky or hoarse voice. Their skin develops smooth or hard patches, areas of hyper- or hypopigmentation, and redness due to widened blood vessels. Together, these changes cause people with the syndrome to have a "pinched"-looking face, with prominent eyes and a thin, beaked nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some people, soft tissues such as ligaments and tendons calcify over time, becoming stiffer. Calcium can also build up in the cornea of the eyes. By their 20s or 30s, many people with Werner syndrome develop age-related cataracts, a clouding of the lenses of the eyes that usually does not occur before age 50. In their 30s, people with Werner syndrome can develop type 2 diabetes, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), chest pain (angina), heart attack or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with the syndrome are also prone to certain cancers, such as thyroid cancer, melanoma, osteosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma. Studies conducted in the 2000s suggested people with the syndrome typically die in their early to mid-50s, but with newer medical treatments, people can &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9195377/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9195377/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;now survive a few years longer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatments: &lt;/strong&gt;There is no cure for the underlying cause of Werner syndrome; treatments are aimed at addressing a patient's specific symptoms. For example, a person may take medications and implement dietary and lifestyle changes to manage type 2 diabetes; undergo surgery and chemotherapy for cancer; and take medicines to counter the hardening of their arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing Werner syndrome may involve genetic testing to confirm that a person carries two defective copies of the WRN gene. In addition, the family members of people with Werner syndrome can undergo genetic counseling to see if they're carriers of mutant WRN genes; those who carry only one copy don't develop the syndrome but could pass on the condition to their children if their partner also carries a mutant copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couples who are carriers but still wish to conceive a child can potentially explore preimplantation genetic testing, which is genetic testing performed as part of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-rvqfYwZHNEUEnAEuWtzwta-Sjw3qO7nfYCOV9VVugW7XZiPSc7u5kSr" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-rvqfYwZHNEUEnAEuWtzwta-Sjw3qO7nfYCOV9VVugW7XZiPSc7u5kSr slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;arly in his new book &lt;em&gt;These Strange New Minds&lt;/em&gt;, Oxford cognitive neuroscience professor and U.K. Google DeepMind AI researcher Chris Summerfield describes a classic cartoon scene in which Wile E. Coyote has just been led over a cliff by Road Runner, his legs churning for solid ground as he briefly hovers above the canyon below, moments from a catastrophic plunge. “I am writing this book because we have just gone over that cliff,” asserts Summerfield. “The safe ground we have left behind is a world where humans alone generate knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;p&gt;Knowledge is, after all, power. It is what has enabled humans to build gleaming civilizations on Earth, to explore the reaches of our starry solar system, to dream up mind-bending artworks, and to grasp the material, cultural, and political dimensions of our everyday realities. As AIs become increasingly savvy at producing and acting on knowledge, what will they or those who control them do with it? In whose interest will they act, especially if AIs begin cooperating with one another?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summerfield is, at least in the immediate future, less worried about the technology itself than about humans’ capacity to understand how it works and to interact with it intelligently. And this is, in part, the purpose of &lt;em&gt;These Strange New Minds&lt;/em&gt;: to help readers understand precisely how LLMs work, how they use language, and why the results look so much like human thought and speech. Over the course of the book, he takes us on a tour of the history of AI’s development—from its early philosophical underpinnings to its pop culture inspirations and impacts and explores our shifting ethics as it relates to these new minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Summerfield argues that LLMs are not sentient—at least not in any way humans can understand—that they’re unlikely to take over and destroy the world, but that they may well exacerbate existing problems. After all, AI’s limitations are not that dissimilar from those of the human brain, he says. We spoke with Summerfield about the limitations and risks of a technological revolution that is approaching so rapidly we’ve barely had time to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

Coyote, we have all just gone over a cliff in our relationship with AI. “The safe ground we have left behind is a world where humans alone generate knowledge.”&lt;em&gt; Photo by Catalina Renjifo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You use Wile E Coyote as a metaphor for the “cliff” we’ve run over in regard to AI. How did we get here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology hasn’t yet outrun our ability to control it, but this is the direction of travel. The metaphor refers to the unknowns associated with a new world in which AI systems can generate new knowledge—the first time an agent other than a human has been able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the significance of the language in large language models?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For humans, language is our superpower. Language is the critical cognitive advance that unlocked our ability to cooperate and collaborate and build an advanced civilization. Language allows us to share knowledge with each other, and to create new knowledge by combining ideas: Think of a horse with a horn—oh! A unicorn. So, the fact that AI has learned to talk is a really, really big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To what extent does AI’s mastery of language give it some of the same super-powers as humans—such as the ability to cooperate and to share and create new knowledge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperation requires more than just language—it requires the ability to infer the beliefs and preferences of others, and to adapt to the social world. We haven’t yet extensively tested situations where LLMs interact with each other, to understand what the consequences may be. Their ability to reason, however, gives AI systems the opportunity to create new ideas, by putting existing pieces of knowledge together in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do LLMs “understand” language or are they just good at acting like it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is we don’t have widely agreed definitions for what it means to “understand” something in the first place. Do you “understand” how a combustion engine works? Do you “understand” why World War II happened? We don’t have strong criteria for making hard and fast judgments like this. What we can say, however, is that LLMs’ formal competence in language, including in generating entirely novel utterances, is as good as or better than a human, at least for English and other well-resourced languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology hasn’t yet outrun our ability to control it, but this is the direction of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book you explore assertions that AI has become or will become conscious. How could AI consciousness impact society?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t think it would affect society at all, because we would never know whether it is conscious or not. When it comes to any agent other than ourselves, consciousness is very much in the eye of the beholder—I can’t experience your subjectivity, but if you display certain behaviors, I will treat you &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; you are conscious. We do this with our pets all the time. I expect that as AI becomes more humanlike, people will come to believe that it is conscious, but we won’t ever know for sure whether that is right or not.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will AI be a tool, or a new form of person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s more useful to think about AI as a tool, and in particular as a sort of digital service that we can use to make decisions on our behalf. People need to remember that when talking to AI they are not interacting with a person—they are using a service that is provided by a technology company. But if it behaves in humanlike ways, it will definitely be tempting to treat AI like a human. However, I am not convinced that what we need is more humans—we have 8 billion of them already. We need better tools for organizing society, so that we can live together more peacefully, prosperously, and equitably—variables that are in short supply right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can LLMs “think?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs carry out reasoning steps in natural language that resemble those that you and I might make when solving a problem. They can even say these steps to themselves out loud whilst they are reasoning, and—just like for you and me—this improves their chances of finding a good solution. But we haven’t really clearly defined what it means for a human to “think” so there will always be room for some people to claim that what AI systems are doing does not count as “thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book you push back against the idea that the use of the word “computation” as a metaphor for human thinking is somehow socially oppressive. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have argued that if we use the metaphor that the brain computes information, we are somehow lowering people to the level of computers, and that this is intrinsically harmful. I agree that it’s important for us to maintain a notion of human “difference”—we have our own concerns, and they should be treasured—but I think the general idea that it’s oppressive to use computation as a metaphor for the brain is a bit silly. It’s just a useful way of thinking about thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People need to remember that when talking to AI they are not interacting with a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You discuss the risks posed by AI “autopropaganda.” How would this differ from the digital misinformation we’re facing today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algorithms embedded in content recommendation systems, such as social media platforms, already ensure that we view “autopropaganda”—propaganda for the views we already hold, i.e. that confirms our existing beliefs. If AI became highly personalized, there is a risk that it could behave similarly, only telling you what you want to hear. The difference would be that AI systems can actively engage with you in persuasive dialogue, so the effect risks being much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many people envision a near future where AI solves the looming issues of the day, but as you discuss in the book, this expectation may be misplaced. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is very good at retrieving knowledge and reasoning about formal problems, but many of the issues that we face today require a different sort of skill—the ability to bring people together to cooperate. We have yet to see much evidence that AI is good at this—although there have been some early attempts, including one that I &lt;a href="http://habermas.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; at Deepmind. [A study on whether AI can function as a political mediator.] The ability to solve formal problems, like playing Go at Grandmaster level or solving logic puzzles, does not necessarily equip you for the real world, where things tend to be quite messy. Outcomes are uncertain—stochastic rather than deterministic—and challenges can arise without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You close the book by exploring some of the potential AI doomsday scenarios. What worries you the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of AI is likely to exacerbate systemic problems that already exist, such as disruption to the labor market from growing automation, the concentration of capital in the hands of large multinational companies, the spread of mis/disinformation in the information ecosystem, the use of cyber technologies for criminal or destabilizing attacks on critical infrastructure, and the environmental costs of intensive demand for energy, water, and rare earth minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am worried about what will happen when AI systems begin to interact with each other. As humans, we are not all that smart on our own. You might think you are smarter than a chimp, but if I stranded you both on a desert island, my money is on the chimp surviving longer. We are good at cooperating, and our intelligence is enabled by our social world. When agents start to interact, they will naturally find modes of acting and communicating that may be misaligned with human values. This is what worries me most! &lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead image: cybermagician / Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="fragment-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
