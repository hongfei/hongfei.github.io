              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Commonwealth has ZIP codes that range from very low risk for a measles outbreak, such as Winthrop’s 02152, to very high risk, such as Middlefield’s 01243 and Conway’s 01341, based on the percentage of children younger than 5 who have had at least one shot of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Compared to other New England states such as New Hampshire and Vermont, Massachusetts has comparatively fewer high-risk ZIP codes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Outbreaks are much more likely to happen where there is low vaccination,” said Dr. Ben Rader, scientific director of Boston Children’s Hospital’s innovation group, who coauthored the paper with Brownstein. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In their study, the researchers sought to capture children who are often missing from official reporting systems, such as those who are homeschooled, uninsured, or too young to attend kindergarten. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For that reason, their estimates for the number of kids vaccinated for measles are lower than those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brownstein and Rader started this work while researching vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. They noticed that skepticism surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine seemed to spill over into routine childhood immunization, including the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, shot.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To gather their data, the researchers used an online surveillance platform called Outbreaks Near Me, where parents voluntarily reported whether their children under 5 had received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. They then applied a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;statistical method that uses limited survey data and population information to estimate what’s happening in a community, and a geospatial AI tool developed by Google to estimate vaccination rate down to the ZIP code level. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Places that we found had severe pockets of under-vaccination ultimately became sources of major outbreaks in the US, like in West Texas and New Mexico,” Brownstein said. “But even more concerning is that it will likely reflect where we’re going to see future outbreaks in the coming years.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, said Massachusetts remains relatively protected except for a few areas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However, New England’s interconnectedness complicates risk. Travel between states increases the chance that measles from higher-risk areas could spread. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It just increases our vulnerability for those areas in our state in particular that might have low vaccination rates,” said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease physician and founding director of Boston University Center on emerging infectious diseases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bhadelia noted that parts of Western Massachusetts are beginning to show lower vaccination coverage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The concern for a state like Massachusetts that still maintains a pretty high overall vaccination is when you get these coalescing pockets of lower immunity,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Hamer said measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, requiring population-wide vaccination rates of roughly 93 to 95 percent to maintain herd immunity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Vaccination, of course, is about protecting yourself and your families, but it’s also about your community,” Brownstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bhadelia said that losing measles elimination status would signal more than just a symbolic failure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It really gives you a state of the nation in terms of our public health and our public health readiness and preparedness,” she said. “It’s reputational, but it also is saying something about disease burden within the country.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A panel of international experts will review the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/well/year-anniversary-measles-outbreak-elimination-status.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/well/year-anniversary-measles-outbreak-elimination-status.html"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; later this year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She said rapid case identification, contact tracing, and public education will be essential to prevent outbreaks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The best we can do is continue to make sure that children are getting their first dose of MMR, and that they’re getting their second dose at the appropriate age,” Hamer said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children receive their first dose between the ages of 12 and 15 months and the second dose between ages 4 and 6. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Despite growing risks nationwide, Massachusetts’ strong public health infrastructure remains a critical safeguard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re great, but we’re not perfect,” Brownstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

    &lt;p&gt;If you have ever lifted a weight, you know the routine: challenge the muscle, give it rest, feed it and repeat. Over time, it grows stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, muscles only &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181915670"&gt;grow when the challenge increases over time&lt;/a&gt;. Continually lifting the same weight the same way stops working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might come as a surprise to learn that the brain responds to training in much the same way as our muscles, even though most of us never think about it that way. Clear thinking, focus, creativity and good judgment are built through challenge, when the brain is asked to stretch beyond routine rather than run on autopilot. That slight mental discomfort is often the sign that the brain is actually being trained, a lot like that good workout burn in your muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about walking the same loop through a local park every day. At first, your senses are alert. You notice the hills, the trees, the changing light. But after a few loops, your brain checks out. You start planning dinner, replaying emails or running through your to-do list. The walk still feels good, but your brain is no longer being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine feels comfortable, but comfort and familiarity alone do not build new brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sTqquL0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;neurologist&lt;/a&gt; who studies brain activity, I use &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.11.052"&gt;electroencephalograms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-century-after-the-eeg-was-discovered-it-remains-a-crucial-tool-for-understanding-the-brain-213843"&gt;EEGs&lt;/a&gt;, to record the brain’s electrical patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in humans shows that these rhythms are remarkably dynamic. When someone learns a new skill, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820296116"&gt;EEG rhythms often become more organized and coordinated&lt;/a&gt;. This reflects the brain’s attempt to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0402820101"&gt;strengthen pathways needed for that skill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your brain trains in zones too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists believed that the brain’s ability to grow and reorganize, called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/541870"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, was largely limited to childhood. Once the brain matured, its wiring was thought to be largely fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that idea has been overturned. Decades of research show that adult &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-021-00433-z"&gt;brains can form new connections&lt;/a&gt; and reorganize existing networks, under the right conditions, throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most influential work in this field comes from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.04.007"&gt;enriched environment studies in animals&lt;/a&gt;. Rats housed in stimulating environments filled with toys, running wheels and social interaction developed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0053888"&gt;larger, more complex brains than rats kept in standard cages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2005.04.009"&gt;Their brains adapted&lt;/a&gt; because they were regularly exposed to novelty and challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human studies find similar results. Adults who take on genuinely new challenges, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1663218"&gt;learning a language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.12.010"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-13416-2"&gt;practicing a musical instrument&lt;/a&gt;, show measurable &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1663218"&gt;increases in brain volume and connectivity&lt;/a&gt; on MRI scans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: Repetition keeps the brain running, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00076"&gt;novelty pushes the brain to adapt&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to pay attention, learn and problem-solve in new ways. Neuroplasticity thrives when the brain is nudged just beyond its comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/714012/original/file-20260122-56-rk8twa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Tasks that stretch your brain just beyond its comfort zone, such as knitting and crocheting, can improve cognitive abilities over your lifespan – and doing them in a group setting brings an additional bonus for overall health.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/knitting-group-royalty-free-image/1977315544?phrase=knitting%20health&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Dougal Waters/DigitalVision via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The reality of neural fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like muscles, the brain has limits. It does not get stronger from endless strain. Real growth comes from the right balance of challenge and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the brain is pushed for too long without a break – whether that means long work hours, staying locked onto the same task or making nonstop decisions under pressure – performance starts to slip. Focus fades. Mistakes increase. To keep you going, the brain shifts how different regions work together, asking some areas to carry more of the load. But that extra effort can still &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329212"&gt;make the whole network run less smoothly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neural fatigue is more than feeling tired. Brain imaging studies show that during prolonged mental work, the networks responsible for attention and decision-making &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78768-3"&gt;begin to slow down&lt;/a&gt;, while regions that promote &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119812"&gt;rest and reward-seeking take over&lt;/a&gt;. This shift helps explain why mental exhaustion often comes with &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-loss-rewires-the-brain-for-cravings-and-weight-gain-a-neurologist-explains-the-science-behind-the-cycle-255726?utm_medium=article_clipboard_share&amp;amp;utm_source=theconversation.com"&gt;stronger cravings for quick rewards&lt;/a&gt;, like sugary snacks, comfort foods or mindless scrolling. The result is familiar: slower thinking, more mistakes, irritability and mental fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the muscle analogy becomes especially useful. You wouldn’t do squats for six hours straight, because your leg muscles would eventually give out. As they work, they build up &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00114.2004"&gt;byproducts that make each contraction a little less effective&lt;/a&gt; until you finally have to stop. Your brain behaves in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the brain, when the same cognitive circuits are overused, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.07.010"&gt;chemical signals build up&lt;/a&gt;, communication slows and learning stalls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rest allows those strained circuits to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108076"&gt;reset and function more smoothly over time&lt;/a&gt;. And taking &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa143"&gt;breaks from a taxing activity does not interrupt learning&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, breaks are critical for efficient learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/714015/original/file-20260122-56-itvcr4.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Overdoing any task, whether it be weight training or sitting at the computer for too long, can overtax the muscles as well as the brain.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/businesswoman-has-stiffness-in-neck-and-shoulders-royalty-free-image/2137509949?phrase=overworking%20the%20muscles&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Halfpoint Images/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The crucial importance of rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all forms of rest, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/STR.0000000000000453"&gt;sleep is the most powerful&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the brain’s night shift. While you rest, the brain takes out the trash through a special cleanup system called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30318-1"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt; that clears away waste and harmful proteins. Sleep also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101449"&gt;restores glycogen&lt;/a&gt;, a critical fuel source for brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And importantly, sleep is when essential repair work happens. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.5.2S.S6"&gt;Growth hormone surges during deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, supporting tissue repair. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-011-1044-0"&gt;Immune cells regroup&lt;/a&gt; and strengthen their activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-understanding-sleep"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the stage of sleep linked to dreaming, the brain replays patterns from the day to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-013-0430-8"&gt;consolidate memories&lt;/a&gt;. This process is critical not only for cognitive skills like learning an instrument but also for physical skills like mastering a move in sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, chronic sleep deprivation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706694115"&gt;impairs attention&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.4668"&gt;disrupts decision-making&lt;/a&gt; and alters the hormones that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23616"&gt;regulate appetite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2018.02.010"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. This is why fatigue drives &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00662.x"&gt;sugar cravings and late-night snacking&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is not an optional wellness practice. It is a biological requirement for brain performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exercise feeds the brain too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-023-03492-8"&gt;Exercise strengthens the brain&lt;/a&gt; as well as the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical activity &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-019-0174-x"&gt;increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that acts like fertilizer for neurons. It promotes the growth of new connections, increases blood flow, reduces inflammation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-023-03492-8"&gt;helps the brain remain adaptable across one’s lifespan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why exercise is one of the strongest &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00184-9"&gt;lifestyle tools for protecting cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Train, recover, repeat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important lesson from this science is simple. Your brain is not passively wearing down with age. It is constantly remodeling itself in response to how you use it. Every new challenge and skill you try, every real break, every good night of sleep sends a signal that growth is still expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need expensive brain training programs or radical lifestyle changes. Small, consistent habits matter more. Try something unfamiliar. Vary your routines. Take breaks before exhaustion sets in. Move your body. Treat sleep as nonnegotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you lace up your shoes for a familiar walk, consider taking a different path. The scenery may change only slightly, but your brain will notice. That small detour is often all it takes to turn routine into training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain stays adaptable throughout life. Cognitive resilience is not fixed at birth or locked in early adulthood. It is something you can shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a sharper, more creative, more resilient brain, you do not need to wait for a breakthrough drug or a perfect moment. You can start now, with choices that tell your brain that growth is still the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As we age, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-mere-sight-of-a-sick-person-can-trigger-our-immune-system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; gradually declines in function, leaving the body more vulnerable to disease. Scientists have discovered a new way to rejuvenate a key component of immune function, potentially boosting health in later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard focused on the thymus, a small organ in front of the heart that's crucial for the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;development of T cells&lt;/a&gt;. These immune cells act as guards, identifying and fighting threats such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="188377" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From early adulthood, the thymus shrinks and slows, limiting T cell production. In mouse models, the researchers were able to repurpose part of the liver as a thymus substitute, sending the molecular signals that stimulate T-cell production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tattoos-affect-your-immune-system-in-ways-were-only-beginning-to-understand"&gt;Tattoos Affect Your Immune System in Ways We're Only Beginning to Understand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we get older, the immune system begins to decline," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Mirco Friedrich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to think about how can we maintain this kind of immune protection for a longer period of time, and that's what led us to think about what we can do to boost immunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188380" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188380" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells.jpg" alt="Liver diagram" class="wp-image-188380 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells-600x429.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188380" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers used the livers of the mice to stimulate T cell production. (Friedrich et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers compared the immune systems of young mice with old mice to identify three key signaling proteins that decline with age: DLL1, FLT3-L, and IL-7. These handle the jobs of turning cells into T cells and keeping those cells healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, an mRNA treatment package was assembled; mRNA (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;messenger ribonucleic acid&lt;/a&gt;) is like a set of instructions for protein production. This treatment was injected repeatedly into the livers of older mice, producing the desired signaling effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is a high-output protein producer, even in old age. What's more, blood leaving the stomach and intestines must pass through the liver, and it's relatively easy to access for treatments like this, making it an ideal target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older mice given the mRNA treatment for four weeks, there were notable increases in both the number and diversity of T cells. They responded more strongly to vaccinations and were better able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-treatment-safely-kills-cancer-cells-with-light"&gt;fight off cancer tumors&lt;/a&gt; – signs of a boosted, younger, healthier immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our approach is more of a synthetic approach," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Feng Zhang. "We're engineering the body to mimic thymic factor secretion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the T cell production boost generated through the liver was temporary. This reduces the risk of overstimulating the immune system, which can lead to inflammation and the body &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nightmares-may-have-an-eerie-link-to-autoimmune-disease"&gt;attacking itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are promising, but this needs to be demonstrated to be a viable approach in humans as well as in mice. The researchers plan to expand their study in the future by looking at other types of animals, signal proteins, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous attempts to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12418"&gt;rejuvenate T cell production&lt;/a&gt;, including putting immune system boosters directly into the bloodstream, often with side effects and risks. These early results suggest this liver-based approach could offer a safe and effective alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can restore something essential like the immune system, hopefully we can help people stay free of disease for a longer span of their life," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09873-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump assiduously courted R.F.K. Jr.’s support throughout the campaign, so why wouldn’t he put an anti-vaccine crank in charge of American public health? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing in life is as inevitable as all that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Slow Boring</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5qazhPckxScnhqbU9PeG51VFBQM2E5bE41UWdSemhxeE42R2VCU01uZGFYN2pHY1hNYzlGZUVWUURHTV9uX0hKT3dVdTJERmplOTV5VkpTSzd6UUE2UG5lNml0Z3ZUN3cwUHNxZFJMYw</guid></item><item><title>血糖峰值与阿尔茨海默氏症风险增加69%相关- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-sugar-spikes-linked-with-69-higher-risk-of-alzheimers</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;High blood sugar spikes after meals could be a contributing factor &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;to Alzheimer's risk&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study that gives us more insight into the relationship between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="189166" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, insulin resistance, and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jdi.12087"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that diabetes and dementia can be connected in some cases. But whether one is causing the other, and what biological mechanisms are involved, remain areas that scientists are still investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers from the UK ran an analysis of a large genetic dataset covering 357,883 individuals, finding that people with a relatively higher level of blood sugar (glucose) in the two hours after eating were also 69 percent more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/garlic-could-be-a-secret-weapon-to-keep-down-your-glucose-and-cholesterol"&gt;Garlic Could Be a Secret Weapon to Keep Down Your Glucose And Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding could help shape future prevention strategies, highlighting the importance of managing blood sugar not just overall, but specifically after meals," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2026/01/14/blood-sugar-spikes-linked-to-higher-risk-of-alzheimers-disease/amp/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Andrew Mason, from the University of Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a technique called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian Randomization&lt;/a&gt; (MR) to analyze the data. Instead of actually taking measurements of post-meal blood sugar, they looked for people with genes known to be associated with sugar spikes after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189169" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph.jpg" alt="Alzheimer's risk graph" class="wp-image-189169 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph-600x248.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189169" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The data showed a significantly increased risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="189166" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; connected to 2-hour post-load glucose (2hPG). (Mason et al., &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Obes. Metab.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this looks at the genetics that each person is born with, it takes out the influence of environmental factors and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-cut-your-risk-of-dementia"&gt;other health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, allowing cause-and-effect to be determined more confidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was a strong connection between post-meal blood sugar spikes and Alzheimer's, no link was found for standard glucose or insulin levels, or insulin resistance, for either Alzheimer's or dementia overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, brain scans carried out on a subset of the participants showed no relationship between glucose or insulin traits and changes in brain or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-memory-center-never-stops-making-neurons-study-confirms"&gt;hippocampus size&lt;/a&gt;, or more white matter damage – the implication being that something more subtle is happening to connect sugar spikes with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous observational and MR studies &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-0905"&gt;have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that 2-hour post-load glucose is a glycaemic trait that strongly predicts poorer cardiovascular outcomes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.70353"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that the genetic predisposition for this marker of postprandial glucose is also associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still not clear why a post-meal burst in sugar raises the risk of dementia, but we know that the brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/db20-0895"&gt;relies on glucose&lt;/a&gt;, just like the rest of the body. It's possible that some kind of inflammation or stress is being caused in brain cells after meals, and further down the line, targeting it could lead to dementia treatments or prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there's a notable caveat to the research: the team was unable to replicate the findings in an older genetic dataset of 111,326 people – perhaps because of differences in how the participants were selected, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original UK Biobank dataset used tends to skew towards healthier participants and individuals of a higher socioeconomic status, and exclusively draws on people of White British ancestry, so more work is required to test this idea in more diverse groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We first need to replicate these results in other populations and ancestries to confirm the link and better understand the underlying biology," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2026/01/14/blood-sugar-spikes-linked-to-higher-risk-of-alzheimers-disease/amp/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; genetic epidemiologist Vicky Garfield, from the University of Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If validated, the study could pave the way for new approaches to reduce dementia risk in people with diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.70353"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

African health leaders said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. At the heart of the controversy is the west African nation of Guinea-Bissau – one of the poorest countries in the world and the proposed site of a hotly debated US-funded study on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study on hepatitis B vaccination, to be led by Danish researchers, became a flashpoint after major changes to the US vaccination schedule and prompted questions about how research is conducted ethically in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Thursday, Quinhin Nantote, a military doctor and the recently appointed minister of health in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea-bissau" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt;, confirmed to journalists that the trial has been “cancelled or suspended” because the science was not well-reviewed. Guinea-Bissau experienced a coup in November, and top leaders were recently replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A team of research experts at the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, at Nantote’s request, will travel to Guinea-Bissau to help officials review the study. Officials from Denmark and the US have also been invited to review the trial, Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa CDC, said at the press meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The decision to halt the trial is not for international organizations or foreign countries to determine, Kaseya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s the sovereignty of the country,” he said. “I don’t know what will be this decision, but I will support the decision that the minister will make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have called into question the credibility of the Africa CDC, after officials with the organization &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the study was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement on Wednesday. He said the Africa CDC was waging “a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts”. When asked by the Guardian, he offered no proof of either claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An HHS official also called the Africa CDC “a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly”, adding that the organization was “not a reliable source”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kaseya said he had spoken to senior HHS officials, who were unaware of the statement, and he pointed to the Africa CDC’s key role in responding to outbreaks with global implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s very important to fund research that Africans actually want,” said Abdulhammad Babatunde, a medical doctor and global health researcher in Nigeria. “Africans want to solve Africa’s problems, not satisfy the curiosity of the funders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers would have given hepatitis B vaccines to 7,000 infants at birth and withheld the vaccines for another 7,000 infants until six weeks of age in order to study the overall health effects of giving the vaccines alongside other shots. Nearly one in five adults and about 11% of young children in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B – putting them at high risk of severe illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is not acceptable,” said Babatunde of the study’s design. “To prevent things like the Tuskegee study and others, the control group has to get the standard of care, and the intervention group should get [potentially] better care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; giving the hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns within 24 hours of birth. Infants in Guinea-Bissau currently receive the shot at six weeks of age, but the doses will roll out to all newborns in 2028 in order to close gaps in care standards. “The current reason why the vaccine is not achieving coverage in Guinea-Bissau is because there’s no funding, and the funding should try to promote the vaccine, not use children as lab rats,” Babatunde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials in an imbalanced power structure may be intimidated, he said. “It might be a very tough call for the officials in Guinea-Bissau, depending on what they stand to lose if they restrict the study. At this moment, it’s [time] for other African member states to come support Guinea-Bissau, to maintain their sovereignty and protect the children of Guinea-Bissau.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When deciding whether a revised version of the study will move forward, “the most important voice” is that of Guinea-Bissau’s ministry of health, which is responsible for protecting the health of all Bissau-Guineans, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Institute. “So hearing from ministry officials today is hugely important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The confusion in Guinea-Bissau comes back to how the trial was given the green light, said Nantote, who spoke in Portuguese through a translator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An early version of the study was approved by Guinea-Bissau’s six-person ethics committee, Comité Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa em Saúde (CNEPS), on 5 November, &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/protocol-for-the-trial-the-broader-health-effects-of-hepatitis-b-vaccination-at-birth-an-investigator-initiated-randomized-controlled-trial-in-guinea-bissau/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Danish researchers. The researchers have since made updates that have not been approved by the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guinea-Bissau ethics committee, CNEPS, initially approved the study, according to an individual who identified himself to the Guardian as the interim director of CNEPS. The study did not mention that infants would go unvaccinated, he said – but the ethical concern is that the vaccine would be withheld from some newborns at birth, when it is most needed. No further changes have been made to the design of the trial because it was “suspended” by the country’s ministry of health, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We think that they did not meet and they did not address this issue adequately,” Nantote said of the ethics committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish researchers did not appear to seek approval from ethics boards in Denmark or the US, though the Helsinki declaration requires approval from research ethics committees in both the sponsoring and host countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS did not respond to the Guardian’s questions on ethical concerns and its characterization of the Africa CDC.

that babies receive a vitamin K shot at birth to protect them from severe bleeding in early life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These recommendations have significantly reduced vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Without this injection at birth, babies are over 80 times more likely to develop severe bleeding, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, in recent years, health care professionals say more parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns. Additionally, a study published earlier this month found that the proportion of newborns who did not receive a vitamin K shot has nearly doubled in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors told ABC News this trend is very concerning and warned that foregoing this shot at birth puts babies at higher risk for life-threatening bleeding early in life that can have debilitating or deadly consequences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;What is vitamin K, and why do babies need it at birth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vitamin K is necessary to help the body form clots appropriately, but babies are born with very small amounts of this vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This puts them at increased risk of a condition called vitamin K deficiency bleeding, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/fact-sheet/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To prevent this bleeding, a vitamin K injection has been recommended for newborns in the U.S. since the early 1960s. It's given as a single, intramuscular shot soon after birth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Vitamin K is a critical factor for clotting the blood, so the best way that we can prevent bleeding in newborn babies is to give them a shot of vitamin K," Dr. Kristan Scott, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since this injection became standard of care, doctors say it is now very rare for babies to experience vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the U.S., but they worry more babies will suffer from bleeding complications as more parents refuse the shot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It was a really successful public health intervention that decreased the likelihood infants were going to have bleeds, whether that be spontaneous in their head or abdomen or following a procedure like a circumcision," Dr. Katharine Clouser, a pediatric hospital medicine provider at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told ABC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser explained that in addition to babies having low levels of vitamin K at birth, they don't get enough from breast milk or formula, making this early injection important for bleeding prevention as early as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That protection extends until babies have introduced enough solids in their diet that contain higher levels of vitamin K, which is usually around 6 months old, Clouser said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Why are fewer newborns receiving vitamin K? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors told ABC News that, in recent years, more parents have been refusing or questioning the necessity of a vitamin K injection at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said that within her group at the hospital, along with discussions among groups across the country, "many people are anecdotally seeing that we're having more discussions about families who are refusing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She continued, "Many pediatricians, and even those who are practicing general pediatrics outside in an office, they're often counseling these families before the baby is born, meeting them before they're born and having a lot of these discussions, which we were not needing to have prior to the last couple of years." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some of the refusals have been fueled by misinformation, such as fears the preservative in the shot could harm children, or distrust in the medical system, the doctors say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Parents may have also confused the vitamin injection with a vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Vitamin K is not a vaccine, it's a supplement," Scott said. "Vitamin K is just a vitamin K supplement and is safe for babies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A recent study, published in the medical journal &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2842444?guestAccessKey=94d98e67-297d-479f-a0ad-9b3daee96709&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=120825" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, for which Scott was a lead researcher, found an ongoing drop in newborns receiving the protective shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott and other researchers analyzed more than 5 million health records from 2017 to 2024. They found that in 2024, 5.2% of newborns did not receive a vitamin K injection at birth compared to about 3% in 2017.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This equates to nearly 190,000 babies who did not receive a vitamin K shot in 2024, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr038.pdf" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;based on population estimates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"[This] might sound like a small increase, but it's a really significant increase in the number of families who are refusing the injectable vitamin K," Clouser, who was not involved in the study, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott said many medical colleagues have shared anecdotes that they are seeing more babies with vitamin K deficiency bleeding as more parents refuse this shot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"What's concerning is that that number could potentially continue to increase, and then we are going to have a larger number of babies that, unfortunately, are at risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Numerous studies that have been done over decades have ruled out harms such as a link between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer, the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors recommend that parents talk to a trusted health care provider or pediatrician before making a decision to refuse vitamin K, to better understand the benefits of the shot and the risks of refusing it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said giving a vitamin K injection at birth is a very common practice around the globe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have a ton of safety data over years and years and years of these formulations, and in fact, we give a smaller dose than we used to, knowing that we have found a really effective dose." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;What are the risks of not receiving vitamin K at birth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Bleeding can happen anywhere in the body without adequate vitamin K, but one of the most feared complications is bleeding that occurs in or surrounding the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Any brain bleed can be life-threatening and, if it's not life-threatening, it can potentially lead to permanent disability for the rest of that baby's life," Dr. Leah Croll, assistant professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Croll explained that babies are at increased risk for brain bleeding because the blood vessels in and surrounding the brain grow rapidly early in life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Those growing arteries and veins can be more likely to break and bleed, and that can cause very devastating consequences that can be potentially permanent," she said. "I'm very, very concerned to learn that parents are potentially electing to opt out of vitamin K administration at birth." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Croll went on, "The idea that this decision could have these consequences, that the baby is then left to deal with for the rest of their life, is really almost hard to wrap your mind around." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott said excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord or after any procedure, such as a circumcision, is also a common complication of vitamin K deficiency bleeding. One &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477513124006752" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that vitamin K injection after birth reduced the risk of severe bleeding by sixfold after circumcision.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, doctors say the risks of the vitamin K injection itself are rare and minimal. The risk of complications from not receiving a vitamin K shot at birth far outweighs the risks of the injection itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There is a risk of a local redness or irritation from an injection because it is an injection, but beyond that, there are really minimal harms to giving vitamin K," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An oral formulation of vitamin K exists, but it is riskier to use in place of the intramuscular injection, doctors say. Instead of a single shot, oral vitamin K would have to be given in multiple doses for weeks early in the baby's life to offer protection from bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Truthfully, we don't know how much of the oral vitamin K a baby would be absorbing. And so, to truly use evidence to prevent risk in vitamin K deficiency bleeding, we should be giving the intramuscular shot," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said that doctors have evidence of what can happen when vitamin K stops being used. In the early 1980s, some hospitals in England stopped providing vitamin K as a routine recommendation due to an alleged association between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer, and it was only recommended for children at high risk for bleeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Following this move, cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding increased among newborns in England, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1421901/#:~:text=Abstract,the%20respective%2095%25%20confidence%20intervals." target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;research found&lt;/a&gt;. The oral formulation of vitamin K was less effective, eventually leading to revised recommendations in favor of the shot, given universally for all babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Oftentimes, families are not receiving the whole story, right?" Clouser said. "They hear that England paused it for a while, but don't know what happened afterward. And so, I think that parents are really wanting to have more information and they don't know who they can trust." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think that what we need to recognize is that a trusted pediatrician, your trusted [obstetrician] are all recommending this vitamin K injection," she said. "And so, we know it is safe. ... I think when you have a consensus like that from many different types of medical providers, whether it be nurses, midwives, physicians, OBGYNs, pediatricians, everyone is saying the same thing. I think it's definitely something that can be trusted." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Jade A.

I was overwhelmed with wonderfully supportive messages – nearly 400 comments on LinkedIn and dozens of private messages, and hundreds more beneath &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpkenx9dzo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;a piece about it&lt;/a&gt; on the BBC News website. Many of them followed similar lines: calling me "brave" for speaking out. Or thanking me for "normalising" brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I didn't feel particularly brave (or normal!) at the time - but it did spell out to me just how much shame and stigma was attached to some of the symptoms of perimenopause and menopause, even though it affects pretty much half the population at some point in their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Hollywood stars like Oprah Winfrey and Halle Berry have spoken out about their own experiences of menopause and its impact, as have TV presenters Davina McCall and Lorraine Kelly. Gwyneth Paltrow called for a "rebrand" of menopause back in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And there have been some changes. For example, menopause screening is to be officially incorporated into &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq50z185d78o" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;NHS health checks in England&lt;/a&gt; offered to women over 40 from this year. Plus, an Employment Relations Bill means that UK employers of 250 or more need to have "menopause action plans". This comes into effect from April 2027 (and on a voluntary basis from this April).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Yet a self-selecting survey of around 1,600 women, published in October by University College London, found that more than 75% felt that they are not well-informed enough about menopause. Which suggests that something is going amiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/646a/live/413a4630-e7cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images for BAFTA Gwyneth Paltrow " class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images for BAFTA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow called for a "rebrand" of the menopause back in 2018&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;What's more, many women say there is still stigma surrounding menopause and feel they cannot openly talk about the menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One woman in her 60s, an academic specialising in social policy, messaged me to say that she had started making light of her "menopausal moments" around female colleagues.

There are an estimated four million women aged 45 to 55 employed in the UK, according a government report published in 2024 – this is the most common window for menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Jo Brewis, professor of people and organisations at The Open University Business School, says that when people mask symptoms at work, this can lead to a set of what economists call intensive margin costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"In other words, the effort involved creates an extra burden for those affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some may leave their jobs altogether. An estimated one in 10 women, aged between 40 and 55, working through menopause have left a job because of their symptoms, according to a report from The Fawcett Society in 2022, which analysed data from a survey of around 4,000 UK women carried out by Savanta ComRes research consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a2d/live/e1e5ddb0-e7cf-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="FilmMagic via Getty Images Halle Berry attends a red carpet event

For example, the Japanese word for menopause, "konenki", means renewal and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There, it's sometimes described as a "second spring" - which nods to a positive transition into a different phase of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Megan Arnot, honorary research fellow in evolutionary anthropology at University College London, says: "Many countries still carry a stigma around menopause, similar to the UK, though it seems attitudes here have begun to shift in recent years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, she suggests there are cultures and countries where menopause is framed more positively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"In many indigenous communities, including Native American and Mayan cultures, menopause is seen as a transition into wisdom and leadership, granting women greater respect and influence […] Similarly, among Indigenous Australian communities, postmenopausal women often become key cultural educators and spiritual guides."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/16c7/live/28860150-e7d0-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A woman walks over a crossing in Tokyo

Problems. We never ask them, did anything change during this time that was positive for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If you only ask questions about negative things, you're going to have very negative perceptions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She spent ten years living and working in Japan, and talking to women there left her with "a sense of potential and hope for the next phase of [her] life".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Admittedly, I don't currently share this view - and if my husband said that to me right now, I couldn't guarantee his safety. But perhaps there is something in the idea of, instead of fixating on the rollercoaster of symptoms, considering the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;No 'one size fits all' answer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Menopause has long been big business: there are dietary supplements, symptom trackers, therapeutic headbands, and life coaches all specialising in it. My targeted social media feeds are full of adverts for midlife natural remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The menopause market was estimated to be worth more than $17bn (£13bn) in 2024, and is projected to reach more than $24bn (£18bn) by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But often none of this is enough by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When it comes to the workplace, Brewis stresses that employers need to be careful about how they offer support. In her view, line managers need specific training to be able to support their teams, for example, in having sensitive conversations and working out reasonable adjustments for individuals. She adds that clearly identifying menopause as a legitimate reason for absence is also important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Some people will never want to disclose their menopausal status at work, no matter how compassionate or supportive their organisation is, and that is absolutely their prerogative," she adds.

At a press conference held today, officials from Guinea-Bissau’s ministry of health said that the study was being suspended pending a technical and ethical review by its national public health institute. The announcement followed weeks of conflicting statements as to whether or not the trial would proceed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding the study,” said Quinhin Nantote, the minister of public health for Guinea-Bissau. “Faced with this situation, we decided to suspend it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mixed messages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting, convened by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), comes after an official with the organization &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/controversial-cdc-hep-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-may-be-canceled" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/controversial-cdc-hep-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-may-be-canceled" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;signalled last week&lt;/a&gt; that the trial would not proceed. In an e-mail to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; today, officials at the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a prominent funder of the research, said that the study was still on track, leaving the trial’s status still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03054-z" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-026-00220-9/d41586-026-00220-9_51462824.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Hotly anticipated US vaccine meeting ends with confusion — and a few decisions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study is proceeding as planned and we continue to work with our partners to finalize the study’s protocols,” wrote Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the HHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continuing row shines a spotlight on long-standing tensions for clinical research trials in Africa. African scientists say that the Guinea-Bissau study shows how political pressure, funding interests and fragmented oversight can push local health priorities aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hepatitis B vaccine trial was designed by researchers at the Bandim Health Project (Projecto de Saúde) out of the University of Southern Denmark, and funded in part through a US$1.6 million research grant from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, part of the HHS. The study aims to randomize 14,000 newborns in Guinea-Bissau starting in early 2026 to either receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth or not, before the country’s planned universal birth-dose vaccine policy begins in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bandim researchers have said that the study is a chance to investigate whether the vaccine has broader effects on infant health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But several scientists have argued that by randomizing newborns to not receive the vaccine, the trial denies a safe and life-saving intervention to infants in Guinea-Bissau, which has a hepatitis B prevalence of about 19%. The immune systems of newborns are immature and about 90% of people infected at birth go on to develop chronic, lifelong infections which may lead to liver disease and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers who oppose the study argue that it is structured in a way that increases the likelihood of detecting harm from the birth dose, even if that harm is not real or clinically meaningful. “They’re trying to use African children to prove a case for reducing vaccines in the US,” says Seye Abimbola, a professor of health systems at the University of Sydney in Australia, who researches decolonizing global health. “That’s problematic.” The United States removed its own recommendations for a birth dose of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03937-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03937-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bandim Health did not respond to &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;’s request for comments on the study design. Hilliard at the HHS said that the research “is based on the highest scientific and ethical standards”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Once it’s damaged, that’s it. Heart cells don’t grow back. After a heart attack, the muscle scars, the damage stays, and doctors focus on managing what’s left. That idea has shaped how we think about recovery for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an Australian &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2026/01/20/human-heart-regrows-muscle-cells-after-heart-attack-world-first-study-shows.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;is gently pushing back on that belief. Not with hype or wild promises. Just with careful data and a quieter kind of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pioneering research by experts at the University of Sydney, the Baird Institute and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney has shown that heart muscle cells regrow after a heart attack, opening up the possibility of new regenerative treatments for cardiovascular disease," the University of Sydney has said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until now we’ve thought that, because heart cells die after a heart attack, those areas of the heart were irreparably damaged, leaving the heart less able to pump blood to the body’s organs. Our research shows that while the heart is left scarred after a heart attack, it produces new muscle cells, which opens up new possibilities. Although this new discovery of regrowing muscle cells is exciting, it isn’t enough to prevent the devastating effects of a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Therefore, in time, we hope to develop therapies that can amplify the heart’s natural ability to produce new cells and regenerate the heart after an attack," first author Dr Robert Hume, from the Faculty of Medicine and Health and Charles Perkins Centre, and Lead of Translational Research at the Baird Institute for Applied Heart and Lung Research has explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heart disease and India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, India reported a total of 2,873,266 deaths due to cardiovascular diseases (as per World Heart Observatory data). " An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% were due to heart attack and stroke," the World Health Organisation (&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/india/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;) says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2016 India reported 63% of total deaths due to NCDs, of which 27% were attributed to CVDs. CVDs also account for 45% of deaths in the 40-69 year age group," the WHO has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So this study basically is trying to find out if heart cells can regenerate. So we know every condition that happens to the heart, whether it is ischemia or infarction, which is infarction is a heart attack and when the heart attack happens, the cells become dead. Now, human cells in the heart cells do not have that capacity to regenerate. Unlike the liver, the heart does not have the capacity to regenerate. But this study just showed that it tries to do that through mitosis to regenerate the cells, but we know clinically that this is not significant. So, our patients are not benefiting from this small amount of mitosis that happens to regenerate. So there has been, I can see three decades where there have been trials of using stem cells to regenerate this myocardium," Dr. Balbir Singh, Group Chairman - Cardiac Sciences, Pan Max &amp;amp; Chief of Interventional Cardiology and Electrophysiology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket told TOI Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, you can inject stem cells into the heart and try to improve the regeneration, but nothing has helped.

They sequestered the signals before they could be transmitted to the brain and cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, the therapy could work for any kind of chronic pain, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sereneuro.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://sereneuro.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daniel Saragnese&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of SereNeuro Therapeutics, the biotech company developing SN101.

It causes pain and stiffness, as well as inflammation driven by the breakdown of bone, cartilage and other tissues. There is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/treatment-plan/disease-management/treatments-for-osteoarthritis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/treatment-plan/disease-management/treatments-for-osteoarthritis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;osteoarthritis symptoms are managed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with lifestyle changes, including physical therapy, and various pain relievers, such as over-the-counter and topical painkillers, opioids, and steroid injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of neurodegenerative diseases — such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease — scientists have been working on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661825003858" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661825003858" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;using hPSCs to replace or repair damaged neurons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With SN101, though, the researchers are taking an alternative approach. The new hPSC-derived neurons are injected at the site of inflammation and exist alongside other pain-sensing neurons, rather than replacing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new neurons serve as biological decoys, binding nearby inflammatory factors before they can be picked up by the body's original neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3c5c605b-63f5-4160-99f3-ab6b4cf763f2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="potential-pros-of-sn101-3"&gt;Potential pros of SN101&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="ee89a6fa-ec7d-41e4-b638-d74c7e6ec007"&gt;Chronic pain, which is defined as pain that lasts three months or more, is often managed with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/manage-treat-pain/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/manage-treat-pain/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;opioid drugs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that bind to receptors in the body to reduce the intensity of pain. However, opioids cause unwanted side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, and carry a risk of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their downsides, it is estimated that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24844" target="_blank" data-url="https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24844" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about 9%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of patients with knee osteoarthritis turn to opioids, which can lead to excessive, long-term use. As such, scientists are always on the lookout for safer and more efficient pain-management techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using biologically complex cells that naturally express multiple pain receptors, SN101 may more closely reflect the way pain and inflammation manifest in living tissues, Liu said. This could help snuff out pain at its source. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prescription-drug-abuse/expert-answers/what-are-opioids/faq-20381270" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prescription-drug-abuse/expert-answers/what-are-opioids/faq-20381270" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Opioids&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, bind to receptors in the brain to temporarily block painful sensations, so they don't get at the signals at the root of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, this work remains at a preclinical stage," Liu emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research will need to pass significant milestones before human use, including formal toxicology studies, long-term safety assessments, and first-in-human clinical trials, he said. Nonetheless, he called the idea behind the therapy "innovative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="a1460edc-b423-4654-8991-6e9d658f0c5f"&gt;The researchers pointed out several limitations in their recent study that would need investigation before SN101 could be deemed safe for humans. One is the treatment's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bioanalysis-zone.com/what-is-immunogenicity/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bioanalysis-zone.com/what-is-immunogenicity/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immunogenicity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — that is, whether it triggers a harmful immune response in the body. Another limitation is that human and mouse knee joints are very different, so some results from the arthritic mouse study might not translate to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Human joints are larger [than mouse joints], more mechanically complex, and subject to decades of cumulative stress," Liu noted. Additionally, "pain processing and immune-neuronal interactions can differ substantially between mice and humans, which may affect both therapeutic efficacy and durability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="253ab9c5-6d07-4e1a-b76f-20531686ca46"&gt;

But there's good news: HPV vaccinations can help prevent cervical cancer, as well as a host of other cancers caused by HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, coupled with regular screening – including a new at-home option – and checkups are the best way to reduce the risk of cervical cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cervical cancer occurs when cells grow abnormally in the cervix," said Stephanie Henderson, MD, medical director for gynecology at Intermountain Health who is based in the Salt Lake City area. "This process usually takes several years, allowing a large window of opportunity to detect and treat abnormal cells early."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January is national Cervical Cancer Awareness Month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cervical cancer is the fourth-most common cancer in women around the world. More than 13,000 women in the United States are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, a number that has decreased dramatically over the past 50 years thanks to improved screening and the development of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV, a group of more than 200 common and highly contagious viruses. HPV, which also causes five other cancers, has been found in body fluids such as saliva, semen, and vaginal fluid but is most often passed from one person to another through direct physical contact. It is a common cause of genital warts and can infect the cells of the mouth, throat, genitals and anus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Historically, about 85% of all people, male and female, will be infected with HPV during their lifetime," Henderson said. "Fortunately, most people will recover from the virus before it causes any significant problems. The HPV vaccine helps people fight off HPV infection and helps prevent an HPV infection from progressing to precancer or cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research shows when detected early, five-year cervical cancer survival is higher than 90%. Yet more than half of all cervical cancer diagnoses are made beyond an early stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 ways to reduce your risk of cervical cancer:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get the HPV vaccine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the HPV vaccine for both boys and girls between the ages of 9-12 years old, because the vaccine is most effective when administered long before exposure to HPV. More than 135 million doses of the HPV vaccine have been safely administered in the U.S. alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccinating our sons and daughters at the recommended ages can help keep them healthy well into adulthood, and is the best way to prevent HPV-related cancers later in life," said Tamara Sheffield, MD, medical director of immunization programs for Intermountain Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescents and adults can get the HPV vaccine up to age 45. Check with your trusted women's health or primary care provider if you haven't received it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Begin getting a Pap smear screening at age 21&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This screening checks the cervix for abnormal cells that can become cancer.  Pap smear screenings are recommended once every three years for women ages 21-29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From ages 30-65, women can continue to have a Pap test every five years with HPV testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Screen for HPV at a checkup or with an FDA-approved home-test option&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guidelines for cervical cancer screening were recently updated by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to include a new home-test option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many tools to help prevent cervical cancer, and one of those is an FDA-approved HPV test that can be used at home by women over age 30," said  Henderson. "We're excited about home HPV tests since they can remove barriers to help more women get screened, but it's important that FDA-approved tests are used and directions are followed precisely for accurate results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask your health provider if self-swab collection is recommended and available in your area, and check to see if it's covered by your insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's also important to follow up with a women's health provider about Pap smear or HPV test results so you know what type of screening and frequency of screening is recommended in the future, based on your age and medical history," Henderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is at risk for cervical cancer?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women who smoke are almost twice as likely to get cervical cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women who become sexually active before age 18 are more likely to contract the HPV virus. Women with multiple sexual partners are also more likely to contract the HPV virus and develop cervical cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women with a weakened immune system have a greater risk of cervical cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information or to find a provider, visit Intermountain's women's health page at &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/womens-health" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;intermountainhealth.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

Many chronic health problems, from hypertension to diabetes, can be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9921002/"&gt;the consequences of a poor diet&lt;/a&gt;. Ultra-processed foods have been the target of criticism not just from Kennedy but a wide range of &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/public-health/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-ultraprocessed-foods"&gt;medical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/ultraprocessed-foods-bad-for-you"&gt;public health groups&lt;/a&gt; in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s a major problem with Kennedy’s vision: Simply insisting that people “eat real food” does not make it any easier for them to find or afford nutrient-rich meals in a country where most grocery stores are awash in fatty, sugary, and salty treats and over-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Instead, he places the onus for healthy eating on the consumer rather than focusing on improving the food environment that makes it so hard for many Americans to eat healthy diets in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s part of the whole MAHA movement to promote individual responsibility. That’s the constant mantra.&lt;em&gt; Do your own research&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;make your own personal decision&lt;/em&gt; about how you feel about these things, irrespective of the science,” said Marion Nestle, a long-time nutrition policy researcher at New York University. “But we know from decades, and decades, and decades of research that individual responsibility is not enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-hidden-meaning-in-rfk-jr-s-food-is-medicine-message" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The hidden meaning in RFK Jr.’s “food is medicine” message&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even though doctors and nutritionists have been clear about the negative impacts of consuming too much ultra-processed foods, Kennedy’s were the first federal guidelines to discourage eating them.

They overemphasize protein based on the latest nutrition science, set unrealistic expectations around a “zero sugar” diet for kids, and endorse certain foods — specifically beef tallow — that continue to befuddle even the nutrition experts who largely agree with the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="sign-up-for-the-good-medicine-newsletter" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Sign up for the Good Medicine newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Our political wellness landscape has shifted: new leaders, shady science, contradictory advice, broken trust, and overwhelming systems.

I spoke with a number of nutrition experts who, while uncomfortable with Kennedy’s actions on, for example, vaccines, still feel his tenure represents an opportunity to improve people’s eating habits and, as Kennedy himself would say, to address the underlying issues driving up rates of diabetes, hypertension, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Ideally, they told me, we could have the best of both worlds: a healthy eating agenda that everyone from Kennedy and MAHA to the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics could get on board with, while embracing the best public health practices that have proven their value over the last half century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s a very real risk here, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem with labeling food as medicine, as Kennedy does, is it could be construed as meaning food &lt;em&gt;instead of&lt;/em&gt; medicine. And that indeed is his administration’s implied message, as they cast doubt on &lt;a href="/health/471362/rfk-jr-vaccine-committee-hepatitis-b-shot"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/07/rfk-jr-antidepressants-teenagers-warnings/"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="/health/462311/trump-tylenol-autism-announcement-leucovorin"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt;: Embrace nutrient-rich foods, but avoid pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Can you use diet to manage all clinical conditions without needing traditional pharma treatments? I think obviously the answer is no,” said Seth Berkowitz, a University of North Carolina doctor who has developed “food is medicine” programs. “It would be problematic to say, ‘Well, I don’t need to take X, Y, Z, I’m gonna do everything through diet.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is already happening. Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.unmc.edu/healthsecurity/transmission/2025/03/04/as-measles-spreads-kennedy-embraces-remedies-like-cod-liver-oil/"&gt;embraced&lt;/a&gt; vitamin A and cod liver oil over vaccines during last year’s measles outbreak in Texas. And it is in line with the more outlandish wellness trends you will find on social media, like people eating &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2024/10/should-you-be-eating-activated-charcoal"&gt;activated charcoal&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes they will purge their body of toxins, that have taken the “food is medicine” concept to illogical extremes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-a-real-food-is-medicine-strategy-would-look-like" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What a real “food is medicine” strategy would look like&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Under Kennedy’s conception of “food as medicine,” &lt;a href="https://realfood.gov/"&gt;it’s on you&lt;/a&gt;, the individual, to put that practice into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem is the prescription for better eating has been tried — and has failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Many of us are living in “food swamps,” as nutritionists call them. Our local grocers and corner stores are stocked with cheap, unhealthy snacks and pre-made meals; the convenience of fast food restaurants are a short drive or walk away. Ultra-processed foods, especially those high in fats and sugars, are literally &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-makes-ultraprocessed-foods-addictive/"&gt;addictive&lt;/a&gt;. Their advertising is ubiquitous, flush with bright colors and cartoon mascots, and often, unhealthy foods are deceptively billed with health-conscious branding (I’m thinking of my beloved SmartFood white cheddar popcorn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Food is medicine,” as conceived by Kennedy, “frames poor diet as an individual problem that can be solved by the health care system or medical establishment, when it is a societal problem to be solved by these commercial determinants of health,” said Alyssa Moran, a nutrition policy researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. “But it does appeal to the people already looking for a natural cure and natural treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If we are serious about trying to address people’s healthy eating, we need to turn the country’s many food swamps into food oases that can make it truly feasible for people to eat healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And, on that front, Kennedy has had conspicuously little to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some nutrition experts do support the Trump administration’s efforts to limit what kind of foods can be purchased with food stamps (though the president has also signed off on significant cuts to the program). The new dietary guidelines will affect — and ultimately improve — which foods can be funded through the national school lunch program and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those are small wins that some nutritionists have long sought. But they are hardly a cohesive plan to make healthy food more accessible and, as importantly, affordable. And the risks of steering people away from effective conventional medical care could outweigh the positive by warning people off ultra-processed snacks and toward whole fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even so, food &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be medicine — in the proper context. But what Kennedy means by “food is medicine” is not the same as what the American Heart Association or other clinicians mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here are a few telling examples: In the 1980s and ’90s, community groups and local governments worked together to tailor meal programs for HIV patients who had no support for food shopping or preparation because of social stigma. The programs were narrowly focused, getting the right kind of food to a particularly at-risk population, seeking to overcome some of the structural barriers to their eating well. And today, Kevin Volpp, who is helping oversee a “food is medicine” initiative at the American Heart Association, which received support from the Biden administration, said their pilot programs aimed at getting whole foods to heart disease patients and those with uncontrolled diabetes were seeing “high follow-up rates, high customer satisfaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the same time, a structural overhaul of food regulations — from what ingredients are permitted to who can purchase unhealthy foods to how foods are advertised — could help address the root causes of the chronic disease crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some of the experts I spoke with sincerely want to see a ban on the most harmful ultra-processed foods being sold to minors, like tobacco or alcohol. But even short of a move like that, we could be doing a lot more to make it easier for people to make healthy choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;That common goal is still worth pursuing, but not at the expense of modern medicine. It’s not an either/or, as Kennedy would lead you to believe; it’s both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9mcDBKWU5aU29nRkRYaE9Ud0VjSTVseHE5NEprSnp1RHlsQTI4N2QxRFFSbFIzZkF6cmlJcGtGUEw4dG9COWZ2TldKSWl4TlBlWWNZWm5jbm83SG5VT3NQV1NrTmhGLUlIRG1WZnZTZ2NRYnNKRy1ZQnIyb3pIQQ</guid></item><item><title>新的研究显示了Apple Watch在检测心房颤动方面的有效性- 9to5Mac</title><link>https://9to5mac.com/2026/01/22/apple-watch-afib-study-effective-standard-care/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container med post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1113132"&gt;peer-reviewed research&lt;/a&gt; suggests Apple Watch could play a much bigger role in spotting atrial fibrillation. In a real-world study, researchers found that smartwatch-based monitoring caught far more cases than traditional approaches, including in people who had no idea anything was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-1036255"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apple Watch &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/06/watchos-5-1-2-ecg-app/"&gt;added the ECG app&lt;/a&gt; and irregular heart rhythm notification with the Apple Watch Series 4 in 2018. Since then, we’ve &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/23/apple-watch-ecg-afib-saved-life/"&gt;heard&lt;/a&gt; countless &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/05/12/apple-watch-atrial-fibrilation-alert/"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/07/apple-watch-diabetes-luebke/"&gt;Apple’s&lt;/a&gt; wearable helping save people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new study from Amsterdam UMC shows just how effective the Apple Watch is at detecting atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The six-month study included 437 people, all of whom were over the age of 65 and at elevated stroke risk. 219 people were given an Apple Watch and wore it for around 12 hours per day, while 218 people received standard care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After six months:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 people in the Apple Watch group were diagnosed
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;57% of those people had no symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;5 people in the standard-care group were diagnosed
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of whom experienced symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This highlights how the Apple Watch can catch AFib in people who never would’ve gone looking for it because they felt fine. AFib is often intermittent and asymptomatic, so short-term monitoring can miss it. That’s why the Apple Watch’s continuous monitoring is key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s Michiel Winter, cardiologist at Amsterdam UMC:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Using smartwatches with PPG and ECG functions aids doctors in diagnosing individuals unaware of their arrhythmia, thereby expediting the diagnostic process. Our findings suggest a potential reduction in the risk of stroke, benefiting both patients and the healthcare system by reducing costs. This reduction would offset the initial cost of the device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what is being called a major milestone in American cancer research and treatment, 5-year survival rates averaged across all cancers have never been higher, with 7-in-10 cancer patients living past 5 years post-diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This average was pumped up by large survival rate increases in leukemia (20%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (18%), and ovarian cancer (9%) over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5-year survival average also stands at 92% for breast cancer in women, 95% for melanoma of the skin, and 98% for prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers were chronicled in the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-research-news/people-are-now-living-longer-after-a-cancer-diagnosis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;75th annual Cancer Statistics report&lt;/a&gt; by American Cancer Society (ACS). It shows how 5-year survival rates have increased on average 20% since 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic states that most cancer recurrences happen within the first 5 years after diagnosis, so surviving this period is a strong indicator that the cancer is under control, and that while not “cured,” has a very low chance of coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20% increase in patients living to the 5-year mark reflects advancements in early diagnosis through routine screening procedures, and advances in treatment like the introduction of immune checkpoint therapy, CAR T-cell therapy, and drugs like tyrosine kinase inhibitors which have greatly increased the survival rate of leukemia patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even pancreatic cancer, long considered as sure as a court death sentence, has peaked over the last 20 years into a double-digit survival rate for the first time ever (13%). Another grim category, liver cancer, has risen from a 7% relative survival rate in the 1990s to 22% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survival rates for myeloma have doubled to 62%, and almost as much for lung cancer (15% – 28%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further still, later-state diagnoses are not as hopeless as they once were. According to the ACS, patients whose cancers had spread to “distant” organs averaged a 17% rate of 5-year survival in the mid-1990s, but now average 35% in the 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The cancer death rate has declined by 34% since its peak in 1991, averting about 4.8 million cancer deaths as of 2023,” the statistics report suggested.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a central regulator of human health, influencing everything from immune function and metabolism to mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And now, researchers from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-26796c20-f7ad-11f0-be49-a76661e62523"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; and the US have pinpointed a critical mechanism linking microbial balance to tissue health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their work reveals that intestinal stem cells, responsible for continuously rebuilding the gut lining, become less active with age, leading to cellular breakdown and a weakened intestinal barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This age-related decline coincides with a significant disruption in the delicate balance of the gut microbiome, which is increasingly being associated with chronic disease and the rise of colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-d94dc3f0-f7bc-11f0-be49-a76661e62523"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the balance between beneficial and harmful bacteria changes, the communication between microbes and stem cells breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This deterioration is believed to trigger a cascade of body-wide inflammation, a major driver of age-related decline. The findings provide a scientific foundation for the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15470619/The-six-WORST-foods-gut-health-revealed-experts-bad-news-youre-fan-sliced-bread-fizzy-drinks-oysters.html"&gt;booming gut-health trend&lt;/a&gt;, showing that the microbiome does far more than aid digestion - it appears to directly regulate tissue repair and cellular aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actor and wellness guru Gwyneth Paltrow is a long-time fan of the probiotic brand Seed, which runs for about $60 for a month's supply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To pinpoint the connection between gut bacteria and aging at the cellular level, the researchers designed a series of experiments, primarily using mice. They first confirmed that the gut microbiomes of young and old mice were distinctly different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, to test cause and effect, they performed a microbiome transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They gave old mice a course of antibiotics to clear their existing gut bacteria, then repopulated their systems with gut microbes from young donor mice, a process called fecal microbiota transfer, or FMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also performed the reverse, giving young mice the microbiome of old donors. To measure the impact, they tracked two key things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, they analyzed gene activity in the intestinal stem cells and in the specialized ‘nurse’ cells, called Paneth cells, that sit beside them in the intestinal wall, focusing on a crucial rejuvenation signal called the Wnt pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Second, they used several high-tech methods to directly measure the gut lining's ability to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This included tracking newly born cells as they migrated up the millions of tiny, finger-like projections, or villi, that line the intestine and absorb nutrients, a direct measure of how quickly the lining was being renewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a final, targeted experiment, they isolated a specific bacterium, Akkermansia muciniphila, that becomes more prevalent with age and fed it to mice to observe its specific effect on the stem cells' function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kourtney Kardashian's supplement brand Lemme markets a popular probiotic for $30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results show that old gut bacteria make the gut age faster but young bacteria can turn back the clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When scientists gave older mice the gut bacteria of young mice, the activity of the critical Wnt signaling pathway was restored and the older mice’s intestines started repairing themselves as if they were young again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their gut-healing cells became more active and better at regenerating tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, giving young mice an ‘aged’ microbiome only slightly reduced their stem cell function, suggesting a young gut environment is more resilient to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that Akkermansia muciniphila naturally increased in the guts of older mice. When they directly fed this bacterium to old mice, it further suppressed the Wnt pathway while reducing the stem cells’ ability to regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant finding in the study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(25)00392-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2213671125003923%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Stem Cell Reports&lt;/a&gt; was that the decline in the gut’s ability to repair itself is not an irreversible symptom of aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Changing the microbiome, specifically by introducing a younger community of bacteria, can restore the function of aged stem cells to full health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gut microbiome, therefore, is a central regulator of the aging process, helping to renew tissues. This also offers a potential target for interventions aimed at slowing age-related degenerative changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wellness industry has embraced a growing awareness of the importance of trying these interventions, including by taking probiotic and prebiotic supplements, eating fermented foods, eating a high-fiber diet and human fecal microbiome transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paltrow is seen above in a TikTok post that promoted Seed probiotics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study shows that gut microbiome imbalance not only influences health and cellular aging but also the onset of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is a key driver of age-related health issues and interventions have to do more than just add beneficial bacteria. They may need to fundamentally reset the entire microbial community to a more youthful state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Probiotics are one of America’s best-selling supplements, marketed for benefits ranging from improved digestion and skin health to better weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millions of Americans invest heavily in these supplements, which can cost up to $60 per month’s supply, hoping to support their gut health and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Probiotics consist of live bacteria or yeast designed to supplement and balance the natural microbiome in the digestive system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their popularity has surged alongside growing public awareness of gut health and the rise of wellness influencers on platforms like TikTok, where gut-focused content reaches millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether they truly are effective is up for debate, but their growing popularity has influenced and expanded the number of studies into their connections to cognitive and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some have shown promising links between certain probiotic strains and reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, improved mood regulation and even subtle enhancements in cognitive functions like memory and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:22:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOUDdWbmQyV3NubkhwanVtczBIbjV3SldpREhtZWRPV0pWTGFoTWtRdDRsOFV0RVRXNmNiQUV1eWNWUmRpcjlzZmpTbEZsV3FWNkJWRHgxSXB6OTdUNzFJVDBFN0lIX0RGU2VYbUQwaTRRQk1FUVczN21MRmM2NWVJYkF0TzZXXy0xdHBsOGR5TVVFakxTazZLaV96MFRfdW94RFgzTlBR0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBQb3I5WGU5cmdJbUlwTzhuLWF0VjV4YTNyYk1NQ0IxalJieXd6MFdjOTdNd0p5eGQzT1NhTmtVV3BBVXJuMVdTTDBIRE1DOXljN3RfRGgxcElQQzVQTEstM1Bvbm5SRm5sVWV4SGdPWUNFZnN1bFNuUmFWNkZ3RllhVUR2aFJ5Y0NycUZCX1RhUWhnX3hIcllGbGQ4Vll0TnphYjRObGdsdE02OA</guid></item><item><title>心脏病死亡人数下降。以下是如何降低头号杀手NPR的风险</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2026/01/22/nx-s1-5685136/heart-disease-deaths-prevention-american-heart-association</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;About every 34 seconds, someone, somewhere in the United States dies from heart disease — which remains the leading cause of death for both men and women, according to the American Heart Association. But a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-disease-stroke-deaths-down-yet-still-kill-more-in-u-s-than-any-other-cause" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the AHA says deaths caused by strokes and other heart conditions are on the decline.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There were about 25,000 fewer deaths from cardiovascular disease and strokes in 2023, compared to 2022, the most recent data available, the annual report released Wednesday says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Deaths due to heart disease rose during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think the last five years, as health overall was impacted by the COVID pandemic, was something of an anomaly," says &lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/katz-institute-for-womens-health/news/the-latest/american-heart-assoc-names-stacey-rosen-2021-physician-of-the-year#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDr.,steadfast%20commitment%20to%20her%20patients.%E2%80%9D&amp;amp;text=Women's%20health%20needs%20are%20unique,Center%20to%20make%20an%20appointment.&amp;amp;text=Request%20an%20appointment-,Dr.,Please%20enable%20it%20to%20continue." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Stacey Rosen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist who is the executive director of the Katz Institute for Women's Health at Northwell Health in New York, and the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/around-the-aha/new-aha-president-driven-by-fairness-doing-right-by-patients" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;president of the American Heart Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So, what will it take to keep the positive momentum going?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rosen says a preventive strategy should encompass the health care system and each person as an individual — and it should focus on the conditions that set the stage for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For instance, everyone should know whether or not they have high blood pressure — also known as hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you look at the U.S. statistics, there's actually almost 50% of Americans who have the diagnosis of hypertension," says Rosen. "And it is truly, aside from quitting tobacco, the most modifiable risk that we have."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many people don't realize they have high blood pressure because it doesn't bring on any specific symptoms. That's why check-ups are important — and the good news is that treating high blood pressure with medicine and lifestyle changes can literally prevent heart disease, explains &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=25223" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Sadiya Khan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Northwestern University. She's part of the team behind the new report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Improving high blood pressure with medicine has never been easier," Khan says. "There are so &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/07/nx-s1-5532108/the-silent-killer-increases-your-risk-of-stroke-and-dementia-heres-how-to-control-it#:~:text=According%20to%20NPR%2C%20hypertension%20is%20known%20as,*%20Limiting%20alcohol%20consumption%20*%20Stress%20reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;many inexpensive therapies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; available, and getting blood pressure under control can add years to life as well as prevent heart disease, stroke and dementia."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two more drivers of heart disease are obesity and diabetes, which can also be managed with a combination of medicines and changes in lifestyle habits including eating better and moving more. Community-level policy changes, like adding green spaces where people can exercise safely is important, Khan says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Having environments that promote activity can help us make healthier choices," Khan says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts have laid out&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.125.012625" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; lots of ideas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of policy changes that could support healthy communities and help lower the risk of heart disease. Initiatives include things like reducing sodium in the food supply (given excess salt in food is a driver of hypertension), and expanding health care initiatives focused on diabetes prevention, obesity treatment, and financial incentives to achieve cardiovascular risk factor reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;""There are many options and ways to move forward," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/parekh-anand.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anand Parekh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan. Parekh &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.125.012625" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote the policy paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the AHA. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;None of us can make policy changes on our own, but there are lots of opportunities to tweak our daily habits in a way that can protect our hearts. The American Heart Association promotes&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt; "Life's Essential 8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;," which includes a focus on diet, physical activity, sleep, quitting tobacco, as well as managing blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and weight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's tremendous data that shows the importance of Life's Essential 8," says Rosen, pointing to the "enormous" impact in reducing your risk of heart disease by following this advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Changing your habits can feel overwhelming, so Rosen recommends starting with small, specific, bite-sized goals: "So rather than saying, 'I'm going to lose weight', 'I'm going to exercise more', say 'I'm going to take the stairs twice a day, every day', 'I'm going to not have a breadbasket if I go out for a meal'."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Celebrating small wins is a nice on-ramp to healthier habits, which can help fend off heart disease. Rosen points to an example in her own life, when the evidence became clear that sufficient sleep can help protect the heart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was somebody who didn't focus on sleep as being a personal priority," she says. A few years ago she changed her habits and routines, aiming to get plenty of rest . "It has absolutely made a difference."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The first known outbreak of syphilis in Europe began at the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-bones-undermine-myth-about-columbus-and-syphilis"&gt;turn of the 16th century&lt;/a&gt;, but on the distant continent of South America, the pathogen's history goes much deeper than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 5,500-year-old skeleton discovered at an archaeological site in Colombia has now offered up DNA from the spiral-shaped bacterium &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treponema_pallidum"&gt;Treponema pallidum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strain, called TE1-3, is not in circulation today, but based on its genome, it belongs to a very old branch, or an "early-diverging sister lineage" of &lt;em&gt;T. pallidum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to have split off before other subspecies responsible for diseases like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syphilis"&gt;syphilis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yaws"&gt;yaws&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonvenereal_endemic_syphilis"&gt;bejel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinta_(disease)"&gt;pinta&lt;/a&gt; emerged and spread around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-shows-just-how-bad-syphilis-got-in-london-in-the-late-18th-century"&gt;Study Reveals Just How Bad Syphilis Got in London in The Late 18th Century&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, led by evolutionary genomics researcher Davide Bozzi, pushes back the evidence for treponemal diseases, as they're known, by roughly 3,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also points to an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-bones-undermine-myth-about-columbus-and-syphilis"&gt;origin for syphilis&lt;/a&gt; in the Americas rather than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-have-been-completely-wrong-about-the-origins-of-syphilis-in-europe"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, adding to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-confirms-syphilis-was-active-in-the-americas-long-before-columbus"&gt;growing genetic evidence&lt;/a&gt; elsewhere in South and Central America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Europe, the first outbreaks of syphilis occurred just after the Italian explorer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus"&gt;Christopher Columbus&lt;/a&gt; returned from his journey to the Americas, and as a result, the two events have been historically tied together – a knot firmly &lt;a href="https://oyc.yale.edu/history/hist-234/lecture-12"&gt;tightened by racist and xenophobic ideologies&lt;/a&gt; about the way diseases spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, genomic researchers are picking apart these deep and twisted roots using ancient DNA. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-confirms-syphilis-was-active-in-the-americas-long-before-columbus"&gt;Growing evidence&lt;/a&gt; from ancient bones suggests that syphilis-like diseases were present in the Americas long before their likeness emerged in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189741" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189741" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis-642x260.jpg" alt="Brazil Skeleton " class="size-medium wp-image-189741" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/HumanRemainsBrazilSyphilis.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189741" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pre-Columbian skeleton in Brazil found containing evidence of an ancient bacterial subspecies related to syphilis (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-bones-undermine-myth-about-columbus-and-syphilis"&gt;Jose Filippini&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unknown whether TE1-3 was spread from human to human via sexual activity, as is the case with syphilis, or by skin-to-skin contact, as is the case with yaws, bejel, and pinta. But based on its genome, this ancient strain possessed virulence genes found in modern versions, which suggests it was harmful – or at least had already adapted to infect human hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their results, Bozzi and colleagues estimate that the divergence between TE1-3 and other &lt;em&gt;T. pallidum&lt;/em&gt; lineages occurred roughly 13,700 years ago – well before agricultural expansion in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that contagious diseases were emerging among hunter-gatherer communities before the rise of dense farming populations living close to domesticated animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our findings show how even a single ancient pathogen genome can shift current understanding of pathogen emergence," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adw3020"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just because the oldest known evidence for a syphilis-like disease was found in South America doesn't mean it was solely confined to this one continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While controversial, a subset of scientists working in Europe &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-have-been-completely-wrong-about-the-origins-of-syphilis-in-europe"&gt;maintains&lt;/a&gt; that treponemal diseases and strains closely related to syphilis were present in Europe centuries before Columbus set sail for the Americas, suggesting that &lt;em&gt;T. pallidum&lt;/em&gt; was present on both continents before Columbus's&lt;span&gt; journey connected the two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Besides, there's even a chance that the expression of syphilis &lt;span&gt;and other treponemal diseases is &lt;/span&gt;environmentally and socially determined. &lt;span&gt;In other words, the bacterium may have been present in various populations but began to spread in different ways, and cause variations of the same disease, depending on environmental conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means the pathogen behind syphilis may not have been a sexually transmitted infection in pre-Columbian populations in the Americas; it may have later acquired this mode of transmission – and the stigma associated with it – in 15th-century Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without more evidence, all of these hypotheses remain possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a related &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aee7963"&gt;perspective&lt;/a&gt;, anthropologists Molly Zuckerman of Mississippi State University and Lydia Bailey of the US National Museum of Natural History, who were not involved in the recent research, argue that these findings "make it possible to move beyond simplistic ideas of where diseases geographically come from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Framing &lt;em&gt;Treponema&lt;/em&gt; origins through geographic binaries, such as 'Old World' versus 'New World,' obscures the ecological realities," they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aee4609"&gt;continue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Far from static or specific to a human population or environment, pathogens are tethered to mobile human and animal hosts and reservoirs, molded by human experiences and biosocial and environmental conditions, adaptable, and globalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adw3020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A rare but potentially deadly fungal infection known as histoplasmosis is sickening a cluster of people in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dozens of histoplasmosis cases have been reported in middle Tennessee since last fall, according to local health officials, while one woman may have died as a result. As of yet, officials have not identified a clear source of the cluster, though the infection is not transmittable between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A hidden danger&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/histoplasmosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20373495"&gt;Histoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt; is caused by inhaling spores of the Histoplasma fungus (typically the species &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;). Most people are not sickened by these exposures, but sometimes the infection causes relatively mild pneumonia, leading to symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain, and body aches. In rare cases, the infection can linger in the lungs and become a chronic problem or even spread to other parts of the body, like the brain, and cause serious, life-threatening illness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early December 2025, the Tennessee Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/program-areas/TNHAN_Histoplasmosis.pdf"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a health advisory to clinicians and labs in the state, warning of increased acute and severe histoplasmosis cases in Williamson and Maury County. At the time, it reported 18 known cases. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Health told Gizmodo on Thursday that this tally is now at 36.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, the family of Alyssia Brown, a resident from Spring Hill, &lt;a href="https://fox17.com/news/local/spring-hill-woman-dies-as-tennessee-investigates-histoplasmosis-cluster"&gt;came forward&lt;/a&gt; to the media to discuss her case and a possibly related death.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Brown’s symptoms reportedly began soon after she moved into her new home in October 2025. She experienced a chronic cough that refused to go away. Eventually, on December 8, she visited an emergency room, where she was diagnosed with bronchitis and prescribed a steroid medication. Her condition continued to worsen, and she passed away on December 15.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Prior to her death, she sought medical care again and requested that doctors test her for histoplasmosis, having heard about the cluster. According to her family and roommate, the test came back positive for the fungus on December 18. Local detectives are investigating Brown’s death, and her family is still awaiting her autopsy results, the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/histoplasmosis-outbreak-tennessee.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mystery source&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A potential origin for these cases hasn’t been identified as of yet, and it’s possible that one will never be located, given the nature of this fungus, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Histoplasmosis is commonly found throughout the soil in Tennessee, so it can be challenging to completely prevent exposure,” the Tennessee Department of Health representative told Gizmodo. Like many fungal infections, though, severe cases are more likely to occur in people with weakened immune systems. People exposed to high levels of the fungus are also at greater risk of severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, the fungus is known to thrive in soil that’s been saturated with bird or bat droppings, and bats are thought to be an important vector for transmission. Previous outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been linked to bat exposure. Last year, for instance, doctors &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-family-infected-with-airborne-fungal-disease-after-touring-bat-filled-caves-2000605418"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; how 12 out of 13 members of a single family developed the infection after visiting the bat-colonized Venado Caves in Costa Rica during a vacation. People in the U.S. have also contracted histoplasmosis from using &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bat-poop-fertilizer-blamed-for-deadly-fungal-infections-in-cannabis-growers-2000539391"&gt;bat guano as fertilizer&lt;/a&gt; to grow cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health is advising doctors to stay on alert for further cases and to suspect histoplasmosis when treating people from middle Tennessee with unexplained fever or respiratory illness.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Like the injection, the new Wegovy pill contains semaglutide, the same active ingredient as Ozempic. It works by mimicking a hormone in the body — glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) — that helps &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-does-the-brain-regulate-body-weight" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-does-the-brain-regulate-body-weight"&gt;&lt;u&gt;control appetite and blood sugar levels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="8316e336-e125-41f4-9f6b-810c671ad906-2"&gt;Both forms of Wegovy are approved to help adults with obesity — as well as adults who are overweight and have related health conditions, like high blood pressure — lose weight and keep it off, in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. However, only the injectable version is approved for children 12 and up with obesity; the pill version is not yet cleared for that age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="56dfb11b-a920-44e6-b684-aac2c8e51a7c"&gt;Here's what to know about the new Wegovy pill and who might benefit most from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-32c8bc40-166d-4790-9e46-78730df8c567" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-semaglutide-pills-work-as-well-as-injections-3"&gt;Do semaglutide pills work as well as injections?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="c28f5363-e847-4603-9086-61b351d99219"&gt;The main difference between the Wegovy pill and the injection is how the drug enters the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When semaglutide is injected under the skin, it is absorbed directly into the blood. When taken as a pill, however, the drug must first pass through the stomach and intestines, where some of its active ingredient is broken down by digestive enzymes before it can be absorbed through the gut lining and into the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, "only a small fraction [of the pill] reaches the bloodstream," explained &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20488/chika-anekwe" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20488/chika-anekwe" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Chika Anekwe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, obesity medicine clinical director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Weight Center and an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School. This is an expected difference between injected and oral medications, in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qFZ8gTUHqxYuA2ppixrs2S" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qFZ8gTUHqxYuA2ppixrs2S slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the pill exposes the digestive tract to more semaglutide than the injection would, its local effects on the gut are minor, Anekwe explained. That's because the "key effects still require absorption and systemic signaling," so they only kick in once the drug reaches the bloodstream, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make up for that digestive process, the pill version of Wegovy is taken at a much higher dose than the injectable form. The highest dose of the pill is 25 milligrams, compared with 2.4 milligrams for the weekly injection, Anekwe told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pill also comes with strict instructions for when you should take it, Anekwe said. It should be taken on an empty stomach in the morning with a small amount of water, and patients must wait at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medications, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.novo-pi.com/wegovy.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.novo-pi.com/wegovy.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;its drug label says&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This ensures that the medication will be properly absorbed at the intended dose. The injectable version does not have these restrictions; it can be taken at any time of day and with no fasting required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1942738547/priya-jaisinghani" target="_blank" data-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1942738547/priya-jaisinghani" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Priya Jaisinghani&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist at NYU Langone Health, discussed the effectiveness of the two formulations during an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpxK_k0dklY" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpxK_k0dklY" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Endocrine Society webinar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about GLP-1 pills in December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, "there has been no long-term, head-to-head trial" that has compared the once-daily 25-mg pill with the once-weekly 2.4-mg injection in adults with obesity, Jaisinghani said. However, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sciencehub.novonordisk.com/congresses/ow2025/plotkin.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://sciencehub.novonordisk.com/congresses/ow2025/plotkin.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;results from clinical trials that tested the drugs separately&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest the two versions lead to very similar weight loss when taken as instructed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the STEP-1 trial, a study of 2.4-mg injectable semaglutide, participants lost an average of about 14.4% of their body weight. In the OASIS 4 trial, a study of the 25-mg pill, participants lost an average of about 13.9% of their body weight. Jaisinghani said these results indicate that the pill and the injection "offered comparable efficacy for weight management."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="8e1a6ab9-90fc-4de2-a49f-15f8ab0f9bbe"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;This is a 1.5-mg starter dose of the Wegovy pill.

These include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About three-quarters of Wegovy users experience mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, Anekwe said. But for both forms of the drug, a minority of patients — around 7% to 10% — stop taking the medication because of these effects, according to trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Some real-world data suggest that a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;higher percentage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819256" target="_blank" data-url="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819256" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;of patients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stop taking GLP-1s within a year of starting them, but that may be due to a mix of factors, including both side effects and medication cost.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2359ea89-a27e-472c-88fd-be773fb75269" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-might-benefit-more-from-the-pill-or-the-injection-3"&gt;Who might benefit more from the pill or the injection?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="0fe998e4-be31-4b3d-9f38-4b8330634f1e"&gt;Patients considering Wegovy may opt for the pill or injection for different reasons. For instance, "the pill may be better for someone who is averse to using injections," Anekwe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pill version may also be more appealing to people who do not have reliable access to refrigeration, such as frequent travelers, she said. That's because the pill can be stored at room temperature, unlike the injection, which must be refrigerated. Generally, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.novomedlink.com/obesity/products/treatments/wegovy/resources/for-pharmacists.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.novomedlink.com/obesity/products/treatments/wegovy/resources/for-pharmacists.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wegovy injectables should be kept between 36 and 46 degrees Fahrenheit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2 to 8 degrees Celsius). And if needed, the pens can be stored at 46 to 86 F (8 to 30 C) for up to 28 days, if their caps haven't been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="44ee8676-efdc-4039-aaf2-a8fc220a82bd"&gt;That said, the strict daily schedule of taking a pill on an empty stomach with restrictions on food timing may be challenging for some people to stick to. Those individuals may prefer the convenience of a once-weekly injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost and insurance coverage may also influence which version people choose. The pill may be better for someone who doesn't have insurance coverage because it has a lower out-of-pocket cost, Anekwe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And besides lifestyle factors and cost, there is another important difference that determines who can use each version: Unlike the injectable form of Wegovy, which is approved for adolescents ages 12 and older with obesity, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.novo-pi.com/wegovy.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.novo-pi.com/wegovy.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wegovy pill is currently approved only for adults&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="a3cc1fe7-ba58-4f8f-a0eb-168093acacf3"&gt;

But 16 days later, the now 30-year-old noticed she was experiencing unusual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The former substance abuse counselor’s eyes were red and dry and her face and lips began to swell, she told Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media, via &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37951078/mum-skin-horror-reaction-drug-face-melting-eyesight/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Sun;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Her symptoms eventually progressed to a painful rash on her torso and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I wasn't sure what it was, I just knew something didn't feel right,” she explained. “The second day, my sister came to my house, and I was pretty incoherent. I was having a hard time breathing and was disoriented. That's when the rash started to spread across my face and left me with blisters. It was very painful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As McAllister’s condition worsened, she realized she needed medical attention and went to the hospital. There she quickly learned from doctors she was suffering from a skin disease called Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emily McAllister&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SJS is a rare and serious skin disorder caused by an allergic reaction to medications, such as antibiotics or anti-seizure drugs, and sometimes infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms include a fever, sore mouth and throat, fatigue, burning eyes, red or purple rashes and blisters on the skin. As these erosions (painful open wounds that look like burns) develop, the top layer of affected skin dies and starts to shed, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17656-stevens-johnson-syndrome" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. The erosions typically spread to the eyes, chest, mouth, nose, throat, urinary tract, and genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SJS can also progress to its most severe form, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), where at least 30% of the skin is affected. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK574530/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institutes of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, about 30% of people who develop TEN do not survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;McAllister was admitted to the hospital’s burn unit and over the next three years, she was hospitalized and fighting for her life. She lost 87% of her skin due to the blistering rash and underwent numerous surgeries including eyelid reconstruction, a stem cell transplant, a salivary gland transplant and three uterine surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During that time, McAllister’s vision also deteriorated — a complication of SJS — resulting in her undergoing six eye surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emily McAllister in the hospital for SJS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Even after recovering from SJS, she said, much of the damage is permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Now I’m blind in both eyes. In the left eye, I don’t have any vision and in the right eye, I wear a special contact lens that helps a little bit but I’m still considered legally blind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She says SJS is "so severe it lasts your whole life. My life is a lot different, I’m considered disabled now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, McAllister admitted that she tries to stay positive about her health journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I do feel lucky to be alive because SJS can be fatal,” she said. “I am lucky to continue to live life and be there while my daughter grows up.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-loses-skin-goes-blind-from-rare-condition-sjs-11889920" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Singapore</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:13:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9paXY1ZXh0XzhiQWtDdnRvMWRuVUpZSU4yOUVENEpLX3JRV3hWeFptelVPel9RdjAtZ1ItdmdrdHBGeDd4NS1tWVVMbktLNkVfWkc3bWVIQ3VyRF9fWEt3dlI0Wmd4eWwyWVktOHBWVEw4UQ</guid></item><item><title>研究显示GLP-1停药后体重恢复较轻-正在寻找α</title><link>https://seekingalpha.com/news/4541668-study-sheds-light-weight-regain-glp-1-use</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sa-content-offsets"&gt;&lt;div class="paywall-full-content R6FbO mb-32 flex sa-text-content sa-media-content sa-table-content sa-content-helpers print:block"&gt;&lt;div class="w-0 grow print:w-auto"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="T2G6W JYDbo" data-test-id="content-container"&gt;&lt;figure class="getty-figure" contenteditable="false" data-show-to-all="false" data-type="getty-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/2244140593/image_2244140593.jpg?io=getty-c-w630" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;This past week has brought a dizzying back-and-forth about a U.S.-funded medical research trial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many public health experts call the study unethical and unnecessary, likening it to the infamous Tuskegee Experiment, while the Trump Administration has promoted it as a rare opportunity to study the potential negative effects of a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The randomized controlled trial — funded partly with $1.6 million from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — would study the general health effects of the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth in the west African country of Guinea-Bissau.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a relatively small study in a relatively remote place, there has been outsized attention, and the rumor mill has been spinning. There have been contradictory reports that the trial has already started, that it has been canceled and that it's proceeding as planned.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This morning at a press conference, the Minister of Public Health in Guinea-Bissau, Quinhin Nantote, finally weighed in, saying the study is suspended pending review.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We decided to suspend or even cancel the above mentioned study," said Nantote, who was speaking in Portuguese, through an interpreter. He said a local ethics committee that had approved the study did not have the "required technical resources" and did not coordinate with the necessary other medical authorities in the country. The country experienced a military coup in November last year and many high level officials changed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nantote said the ethics review was the "consequence of misinformation, weak social communication means and a lack of international communication, leading to inappropriate interpretations of our national health policies regarding immunization and health studies." He added that there has "been no sufficient coordination in order to take a final decision regarding that study."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Africa CDC, the health agency of the African Union, says it is sending a team to Guinea-Bissau to help the country evaluate the study. It says that local officials have the final authority.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not a foreign country that will come and say this one will take place. It's the sovereignty of the country," says Dr. Jean Kaseya, director-general of Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Immediately following the Thursday press conference, speaking on the condition of anonymity, an official with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent an email to NPR that contradicted Nantote and Kasaya, asserting that the study has not been suspended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's a look at why this trial has garnered so much attention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This study is happening as U.S. vaccine policy changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, giving the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/04/nx-s1-5629168/hepatitis-b-vaccine-kids-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hepatitis B&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vaccine to all newborns in the U.S. has been standard practice. It's also &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the recommendation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vaccine helps prevent infants from getting the hepatitis B virus from their mothers during delivery. The virus attacks the liver and can, years later, lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and death. There's no known cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, on December 5, CDC advisers &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/05/nx-s1-5634004/cdc-hepatitis-b-vaccine-acip-meeting" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;voted to overturn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisers — hand-picked by vaccine-skeptic and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — worried the vaccine might cause some harm. However, outside medical groups point to numerous &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ebch.120" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showing that it's safe and that rates of pediatric hepatitis B virus have &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/searchable-download/Universal%20Hepatitis%20B%20Vaccination%20at%20Birth%202Dec2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dropped by 99%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since 1991 and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.4.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CDC reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that in 2020 only 10 children in the U.S. got hepatitis B from exposure at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Less than two weeks after the vote, a &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;document emerged&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; detailing that the CDC would fund a study to look into the hepatitis B vaccine in Guinea-Bissau, where nearly one in five adults are infected with hepatitis B virus. That rate is much higher than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa where the prevalence is just around 6%, according to the Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basics of the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Guinea-Bissau does not currently give the hepatitis B vaccine to newborns per the WHO recommendation but plans to start doing so in 2028, according to Guinea-Bissau's Nantote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Danish researchers say on &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;their website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that they want to study 14,500 newborns during this "unique window of opportunity" before the birth vaccination starts. Half of newborns will get the hepatitis B vaccine at birth, while the other half would get the inoculation later as part of other routine vaccinations given at 6, 10 and 14 weeks old.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The idea is not to test whether the hepatitis B vaccine works against hepatitis B. Instead, the researchers are looking for other health effects of the vaccine. Do the newborns who get the vaccine develop other severe illnesses in the first few weeks of life? Do they get eczema in the first two years of life? Or perhaps they show neurological differences before they turn 5?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ethics: unethical and unnecessary? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not long after the study surfaced physicians and medical ethicists called for its cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[The Guinea-Bissau study] is highly unethical and cruel and frankly dishonest," says &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Paul Offit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and formerly a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's one of a number of physicians who have compared this study to the notorious &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/16/967011614/in-tuskegee-painful-history-shadows-efforts-to-vaccinate-african-americans" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tuskegee Experiment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which started in the 1930s and, for decades, denied treatment to poor African Americans with syphilis so that researchers could see how the disease progresses. More than 100 died as a result.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The 7,000 group that's not getting the vaccine till six weeks of age are now being exposed to substandard care — substandard care that is being paid for by American tax dollars," Offit says, noting that with such a high rate of hepatitis B virus in the population many of those youngers could be infected by their mothers before 6 weeks of age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious disease physician at Emory University, agrees with the Tuskegee analogy and worries the study could be the "initial trigger that then leads to communities being distrustful of medical intervention and vaccines." She says that distrust can last decades and even be passed down from generation to generation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the study counter that, currently, newborns in Guinea-Bissau are not getting the vaccine at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"No newborn in Guinea-Bissau will receive fewer vaccines because of this study," they wrote on &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;their website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, defending their study. They foresee that "vaccination coverage will increase" explaining "trial vaccination teams will operate every day of the year, including weekends and holidays. This is expected to increase timely vaccination coverage compared with routine services." The researcher did not respond to NPR's multiple requests for comment about the ethical questions and whether the study has been canceled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some bioethicists say there's a more fundamental issue: "The first and important consideration in making a study ethical is: The study has to answer a valuable question," says Christine Grady, former chief of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. "In this case, I think that's perhaps the biggest problem with this study," she says, noting that the vaccine has long been known to be safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers argue on their website that the results "will contribute to the global scientific understanding of how vaccination affects overall child health" and that "this is an important trial which can impact future vaccine policies in the region and worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The politics: Non-competitive, questionable researchers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another major point of contention: who is doing the research and how they were selected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Danish researchers at the helm — including Dr. Christine Stabell Benn — are highly controversial. They are affiliated with the University of Southern Denmark and lead the Bandim Health Project, which has done research in Guinea-Bissau for decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While work by Stabell Benn's team has been published in reputable scientific journals, their statistical work has been questioned. For example, last month, in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, outside biostatisticians evaluated the studies coming out of Bandim Health. What they found was that the group has "systematically over-interpreted the findings from their randomized trials," meaning the conclusions have been overstated and often aren't backed up by the data&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;when there was "proper statistical handling." That's according to a &lt;a href="https://health.au.dk/en/display/artikel/randomized-trials-show-no-evidence-of-non-specific-vaccine-effects" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;press release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the article.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I was surprised by some quite strong claims," explains &lt;a href="https://www.au.dk/en/stovring@biomed.au.dk/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Henrik Støvring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pharmacometrics and statistics at Denmark's Aarhus University and lead author on the article. "But whenever I looked at a randomized trial — the primary outcomes I could find — it did not show statistical significance."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Stabell Benn's team has pushed back against this conclusion and requested the review be retracted by the journal. The request is being reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, RFK Jr. is a fan of Stabell Benn's team.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He cited a widely-criticized study on vaccine safety by Stabell Benn and others when he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-74752/rfk-jr-vaccines-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pulled more than a billion dollars&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. funding for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. That money would have helped fund childhood vaccinations in many low-resources settings. The anti-vaccine organization RFK Jr. chaired — &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Children's Health Defense&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — also &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/research_tags/diphtheria-tetanus-pertusis-dtp/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Danish researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Outside vaccine experts have raised another concern: that the CDC awarded the $1.6 million dollars without an open, competitive process.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's led &lt;a href="https://medicine.usask.ca/profiles/bmi-affiliated/angela-rasmussen.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Angela Rasmussen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan, to worry that the Bandim Health Project was hand-picked by RFK Jr.'s team to do the research, since they are known to have raised safety concerns about vaccines long considered safe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"[The thing] people really need to know [is] behind this all — is cronyism, is bad science," she says. "It's babies getting chronic illnesses that can kill them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement to NPR, the U.S. HHS defended the study and said it is proceeding as planned and the protocol is being finalized. Their statement said the study "represents the world's first and perhaps only opportunity to test the overall health effects of [the hepatitis B vaccine at birth]."&lt;/p&gt;

On the flip side, it is possible to take your H20 intake to the extreme and become overhydrated, especially if you fall into certain groups. There are signs you’re drinking too much water, though, that can help you recognize when it’s time to dial it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/natasha-trentacosta-938538.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natasha Trentacosta, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natasha Trentacosta, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles; &lt;a href="https://www.wmchealth.org/physician-locator/michael-klein-1508866757" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michael Klein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michael Klein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a kidney specialist with WMCHealth in Hawthorne, NY and an associate professor at New York Medical College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overhydration is when there is an excess of water intake compared to water loss,” says &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/natasha-trentacosta-938538.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natasha Trentacosta, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natasha Trentacosta, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in LA. Here, doctors explain the signs of overhydration you should know in order to modulate your water intake in a healthy way, plus who can become overhydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of overhydration to know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mild water overload often is asymptomatic,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wmchealth.org/physician-locator/michael-klein-1508866757" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michael Klein, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michael Klein, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a kidney specialist with WMCHealth in Hawthorne, NY and an associate professor at New York Medical College. Still, there are some signs that may suggest an underlying issue with how your body is processing water (more on those below). According to the experts we spoke to, the most common signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who can become overhydrated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average healthy person likely does not need to worry about overhydration. “Your body is very effective at adjusting,” says Dr. Klein. “Once you reach adequate water levels, your body just gets rid of the excess very efficiently, assuming a state of normal health.” This is also the reason you don’t immediately get sick from not drinking enough water, Dr. Klein adds, because your body can adjust to changes in your water intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are certain groups of people who need to be careful not to overhydrate. The first is people with certain kidney diseases, especially those who produce excessive amounts of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is also known as vasopressin. “People who have an excess of ADH have strict water restrictions and water can be deadly. They have to be very careful,” says Dr. Klein. He explains that in these people (whose official diagnosis is &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000314.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion&lt;/a&gt;, or SIADH), ADH tells the body to hold onto water no matter how much you drink, which can lead to water intoxication if not accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar thing happens in people with liver disease and congestive heart failure, Dr. Klein says. “In &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a30872553/heart-failure-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart failure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, your kidneys think you are dehydrated, and they will secrete these hormones, and if you drink water, you can get profoundly water toxic,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overhydration may also happen in athletes if they drink excessive amounts of water following strenuous exercise or activity, says Dr. Trentacosta. “This dilutes the sodium in their bodies and results in hyponatremia,” she adds. Per the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Fhyponatremia%2Fsymptoms-causes%2Fsyc-20373711&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa70049905%2Fcan-you-drink-too-much-water%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, hyponatremia is a condition in which sodium levels drop dangerously low. In addition to the groups of people mentioned above, it may also occur in those taking diuretics or antidepressants, people who have adrenal gland insufficiency or low thyroid hormone, or those who have chronic and severe vomiting or &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65833239/causes-of-diarrhea-to-know-about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diarrhea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, for most people, neither type will be an issue. “Normally, drinking large amounts of water, even up to six gallons, can be managed by the natural ability of our bodies to regulate water excretion through the combined efforts of the pituitary gland, kidneys, liver, and heart,” Dr. Trentacosta says. “But if any of these organs are dysfunctional, that upper limit can be lowered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overhydration is rare, but it can occur—and in some cases, it may be caused by a serious issue that needs to be addressed. If you’re regularly experiencing any of the symptoms above, it’s definitely worth giving your physician a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:30:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOLXpZOTdkSjlKVlFBVnYtTDQxYm93QmlOQ2FqeWc4QUpHMkc3VHhMdW9HbVRxQ2FmMlczbXcyOXFGbG90UkpydG1xQ0EwNlJRa0I1MFE0c3dUcHhNVC1MTDJaYkMwWDNmVGNTT0t0dFh2LUNEZ1BYMTBSS3hrRkpNTnhR</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心疫苗顾问对脊髓灰质炎疫苗接种的首要问题，其他长期建议- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/22/vaccine-policy-adviser-kirk-milhoan-individual-rights-trump-public-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chair of a federal vaccine advisory panel charted a new course for the committee in a podcast released Thursday — suggesting the public might want to reconsider the use of polio vaccines, arguing individual freedoms should be a north star of the panel, and pointing to the Covid pandemic as key to his thinking on health policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who became chair of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in December, also downplayed established science on vaccines during an interview for the podcast and suggested policy goals, not new research, were the driving force behind changing recommendations in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging interview with the podcast “&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-should-i-trust-you/id1788335471?i=1000746190751" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Why Should I Trust You&lt;/a&gt;?”, Milhoan painted a more detailed picture of the committee’s strategy than has been previously known as it moves to weigh recommendations for vaccines given to children and pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked why the committee had revised existing recommendations, including delaying the age by which some children are immunized for hepatitis B, Milhoan said plainly: “Yeah, because we were concerned about mandates, and mandates have really harmed and increased hesitancy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current members of the ACIP were handpicked by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he dismissed its prior members last summer, accusing them of being influenced by the pharmaceutical industry. The new members, who include a number of Kennedy allies and vaccine critics, have since recommended removing thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative, from flu vaccines and splitting the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella combined shot with varicella taken separately. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group now intends to continue to review long-settled recommendations for pediatric vaccines and those given to expectant parents. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-should-i-trust-you/id1788335471?i=1000746190751" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first interview Milhoan has given&lt;/a&gt; since a December ACIP meeting during which the hepatitis B recommendation was made and since he became chair. After the December meeting of the committee concluded, Milhoan was heard comparing the members of the panel to “puppets on a string.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I was referring to what it’s like to be a committee member when there are lots of different pressures and threats coming in,” Milhoan said in the podcast, pushing back when asked if Kennedy or his agency was the “puppet master.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t had anyone say, ‘Kirk, this is what we want to make sure is voted on,’” he said. Milhoan did say, though, that he and other members of the committee have been subjected to threats, and that his son bought him bullet-proof clothing for Christmas. “You know, we have a whole email thread of all the threats we get as ACIPs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-public-health-versus-individual-rights-nbsp"&gt;Public health versus individual rights &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Milhoan clearly laid out what he sees as the goal of the new ACIP: protecting individual rights over public health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we are doing is returning individual autonomy to the first order, not public health, but individual autonomy to the first order,” he said. Members of the panel have frequently questioned whether providers adequately inform patients of the risks and benefits of vaccines. At one point, Milhoan accused the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is suing the Department of Health and Human Services over its vaccine policies, of claiming their members don’t have time to adequately inform patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“[Patients] should be making the decisions on what the risks are of disease, what the risks are of vaccines, which is different for each person, what the family history is, and then make a decision from there, as opposed to what was sort of more of a heavy-handed, authoritarian thought of the vaccine schedule that led to mandates that if you didn’t have this set of vaccines exactly how they were prescribed, then you didn’t get in school,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked about Milhoan’s remarks, an AAP official said they were “only the latest step in an effort to sow doubt and confusion” about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our answer is and has always been clear — talk to your doctor about the recommended vaccines for your child. Those decisions have always been made in partnership,” said Sean O’Leary, chair of the AAP’s committee on infectious diseases. “The answer isn’t biased government intervention, it’s trusted engagement between parents and doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the spectre of Covid-19 loomed large for Milhoan in the podcast: He frequently pointed back to messaging about the Covid vaccines, which he believes were made out to be more effective than they are. He also said that, as a pediatric cardiologist, vaccines weren’t front of mind for him until Covid-19 vaccine mandates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People couldn’t go to school, and they couldn’t do this, and they couldn’t do this, to get a vaccine that has really been a large failure,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milhoan also addressed what top appointees at the Food and Drug Administration have described as evidence that at least 10 children &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/29/covid-vaccine-deaths-fda-memo-vinay-prasad/"&gt;died from getting Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, calling it “a very large death signal.”  Vaccine experts have called on the FDA to make the data public; to date it has not. Milhoan told the podcast hosts he had seen the data, but did not elaborate on them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Milhoan cast doubt on the scientific rigor of current public health decision-making. “I don’t like established science,” he said, adding “science is what I observe.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He pushed back on co-host Brinda Adhikari’s assertion that vaccines have been proven to reduce the spread of polio and measles viruses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking at the observable science,” he said. “And what I’m saying is that there is an emotion when people use the word proven.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He criticized previous iterations of the ACIP for not thoroughly considering the safety of vaccines — even though the committee has previously recommended pulling vaccines from the market because of safety concerns — and said the new committee is bringing an “increased level” of focus on safety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, he also said he had no new framework to evaluate vaccine safety, even as he criticized the CDC’s available vaccine safety reporting system. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have a new solution. We’re working to figure out why it broke,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questioning-polio-measles-vaccines"&gt;Questioning polio, measles vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked about his thoughts on polio and measles vaccines, Milhoan seemed to question whether both are still necessary. There has been an international effort for nearly the past 40 years to eradicate the crippling polio virus, which still spreads in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and which occasionally makes its way out of that region. Measles, however, is running rampant in parts of the United States, with transmission occurring at rates that haven’t been seen since the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think also, as you look at polio, we need to not be afraid to consider that we are in a different time now than we were then. Our sanitation is different, our risk of disease is different, and so those all play into the evaluation of whether this is worthwhile of taking a risk for a vaccine or not,” Milhoan said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When … we talk about the risk of, let’s say, measles, many of those risks of not getting measles without having a vaccine was in the 1960s. We take care of children much differently now,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan’s suggestion that both better sanitation and less crowding could bring those diseases under better control than before the vaccines were introduced is a common talking point of Kennedy’s as well. One of Kennedy’s lawyers, Aaron Siri, prior to Kennedy’s confirmation, had petitioned the FDA to revoke approval for the polio vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan also seemed to suggest that the ongoing outbreaks will generate modern estimates of the risks measles poses. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’re going to have is a real-world experience of when unvaccinated people get measles,” he said. “What is the new incidence of hospitalization? What’s the incidence of death?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan said he didn’t want vaccination rates to decline — though many public health experts say health officials’ changes to vaccine policy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/06/what-new-vaccine-schedule-means-doctors-parents-kids/"&gt;will do just that by introducing further uncertainty and confusion&lt;/a&gt; for families wondering whether to vaccinate their children. Earlier this month, the HHS recommended an entirely new childhood vaccine schedule, which slashed the number of recommended vaccines. ACIP was not consulted on the change but Milhoan said didn’t offend him. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have a desire for less people to get vaccinated,” Milhoan said. “My desire is to have as low a side effect profile as we can that has the maximum efficacy in preventing disease or preventing horrible outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. are having a chilling effect on vaccine makers as anti-vaccine rhetoric has turned into concrete changes to inoculation schedules and recommendations, investors and executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administration of President ​Donald Trump has, in the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51428590/us-revises-childhood-vaccine-schedule-to-recommend-fewer-shots" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;upended vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, with the U.S. last month ending its longstanding guidance that all children receive inoculations against flu, hepatitis A and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51431259/doctors-say-changes-to-us-vaccine-recommendations-are-confusing-parents-could-harm-kids" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;The unprecedented changes&lt;/a&gt; have led to diminished vaccine usage, hurt the investment case for some biotechs and created a drag that will likely dent revenues and raise costs for companies in the ⁠coming years, 15 investors and analysts told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccines will not be a growth area under the current administration," said Stephen Farrelly, global pharma and healthcare lead at ING, signaling a potential drag on the sector through 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine policy under Kennedy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who has ‌cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of vaccines contrary to scientific evidence, has moved quickly since taking over the Department of Health and Human Services under Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He fired a panel of independent ⁠expert advisers, replacing them with members who share his anti-vaccine views, and dropped broad COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for pregnant women and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also revived research into a long-ago debunked claim linking vaccines to autism, and adopted ‌new, reduced &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51433239/rsv-vaccination-push-made-a-huge-difference-for-utahs-kids-intermountain-health-says" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;childhood vaccine schedules&lt;/a&gt; without the long-standing ‍practice of involving a broad group of outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and analysts initially saw Kennedy's appointment as a headline risk, rather than a fundamental threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, issues such ⁠as tariffs and drug-pricing pressure from the Trump administration were weighing on sentiment, putting vaccine concerns on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanofi Chief Financial ⁠Officer François-Xavier Roger last year noted "a little bit of negative buzz" around vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That changed as the risks became less theoretical. Investors are now concerned that the impact of Kennedy's policies will be hard to reverse, echoing public health experts' worries, who also said they will lead to preventable illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy says the changes aim to improve safety and bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other peer nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A HHS spokesperson said in a statement that vaccine recommendations are based on the best available "gold-standard scientific evidence and public health considerations, not corporate interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big vaccine makers include UK-based GSK, France's Sanofi, U.S. drugmakers Pfizer and Merck, and smaller firms such as Moderna, Novavax and Germany's BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The striking policy changes have begun to prompt some rare public rebukes from industry leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla and Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson criticized Kennedy's rhetoric at a major healthcare conference last week, with Hudson citing "all the ... misinformation that is going around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bourla told reporters it ‍was driving down vaccination rates and increasing disease risk. "I'm seriously frustrated," he said. "What is happening has zero scientific merit and is just serving an agenda which is political and antivax."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Political pressure starts to bite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term prospects for vaccine makers remain robust, investors said, as vaccines are still the most effective tool for preventing disease. But they said companies were now more beholden to the whims of political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, success and failure will rest on the opinions of a few people. It's not enough to have good science and commercial opportunity," said Clear Street analyst Bill Maughan. "If you're a biotech investor, it just seems tough to really get conviction in a vaccine name right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors said they would stick by large-cap drugmakers less dependent on vaccine revenue, such as GSK, Sanofi, Pfizer and Merck. Smaller players like Moderna, BioNTech and Novavax face sharper risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of U.S. changes is already starting to take hold. GSK and Sanofi reported lower U.S. flu vaccine sales in the third quarter, despite ‌a more severe flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Australia's CSL postponed separating its vaccine unit, Seqirus, citing "heightened volatility" and falling U.S. vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's clearly consumer reaction to the narrative that is coming out in the United States," said Jefferies analyst Michael Leuchten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Long-term view&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors said demand for vaccines and disease ‌prevention will likely rebound. Outbreaks such as the rising measles cases in South Carolina, or an extended severe flu season, could drive renewed vaccine usage, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently said the 2025–26 flu season had seen at least 11 million cases and 5,000 deaths reported so far, nearly double last year's toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, have challenged Kennedy's policies in court and it remains to be seen how that will play out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors "often focus on shorter-term time frames, while companies clearly take a far longer-term view," said Linden Thomson, senior portfolio manager at asset management firm Candriam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These businesses have been around for decades. They don't invest on a one- or ⁠two-year horizon," agreed Matthew Masucci, an analyst for Callodine ​Capital, which owns GSK and Sanofi shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for now, investors may be more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whipsawing U.S. policy and vaccine skepticism are a drag on investment, said Ian Turnbull, an equity analyst at investment firm Mawer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does make it a less attractive market to invest in if your demand isn't predictable like it used to be," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;
