							&lt;p&gt;The clock read 3:47 AM when I found myself staring at the ceiling again, mind racing like I'd just chugged three espressos. No alarm. No noise. Just my brain deciding that the middle of the night was prime time for consciousness. If this sounds familiar, you're part of a surprisingly large club—one that meets nightly in the liminal space between deep sleep and dawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months, I assumed this was just another quirk of modern life, like doom-scrolling or having strong opinions about oat milk brands. But after diving into the research (spurred by my own obsessive sleep tracking), I discovered something fascinating: these early morning wake-ups might be your body trying to communicate something important about your circadian rhythm, stress levels, or overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The science of the 3 AM club&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's actually happening when you bolt awake at ungodly hours: Your body follows a complex 24-hour cycle that governs everything from hormone production to body temperature. Around 2-3 AM, something interesting occurs—your cortisol levels begin their natural rise, preparing your body for eventual morning awakening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, this rise is gradual, gently nudging you toward consciousness around 6 or 7 AM. But for many of us, this system has gone haywire. Dr. Michael Breus's research on sleep chronotypes suggests that our modern environment has stretched the natural variation in sleep patterns to extremes we've never seen before in human history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it like this: Your cortisol is supposed to be a slow-building crescendo, but stress turns it into a jarring alarm bell. When you're already running high on stress hormones during the day, that &lt;a href="https://www.ptsduk.org/sleep-and-cortisol-in-ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;natural 3 AM rise can overflow your metaphorical cup&lt;/a&gt;, yanking you into consciousness when you should be in deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why your sleep cycles matter more than you think&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every night, you cycle through different &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/stages-of-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stages of sleep&lt;/a&gt; approximately every 90-120 minutes. The fascinating part? The architecture of these cycles changes throughout the night. Early on, you get more deep, restorative sleep. But as morning approaches, you spend more time in REM sleep—the stage where your brain is almost as active as when you're awake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things become crucial. REM sleep is when your brain processes emotions and consolidates memories. It's also when you're most likely to wake up and actually remember it. Those 3-5 AM wake-ups often coincide with longer REM periods, which might explain why your brain feels so annoyingly alert—it's already revved up, processing the day's experiences and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Matthew Walker's research shows that even short-term sleep debt can disrupt this delicate dance, creating a cascade of effects that make quality sleep increasingly elusive. Think of it as a snowball rolling downhill—each night of poor sleep makes the next night harder, accumulating into an avalanche of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The chronotype connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone's internal clock runs on the same schedule. Some of us are &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-03-17-having-genetics-night-owl-protects-night-shift-workers-against-sleep-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;genetically programmed night owls&lt;/a&gt;, while others are natural early birds. The research reveals something surprising—scientists have identified at least nine different genes that influence whether you're more likely to thrive at dawn or come alive after dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the kicker: our modern world has &lt;a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/sleep/2020/night-owl-chronotypes-in-a-morning-lark-world-122120" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pushed these natural variations to extremes&lt;/a&gt;. Where morning larks and night owls might have been separated by just a few hours in pre-industrial times, we now see spreads of up to 12 hours between extreme chronotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because fighting your natural chronotype is like swimming upstream—possible, but exhausting. If you're a night owl forced into a morning lark's schedule, those 3 AM wake-ups might be your body's protest against social jet lag, the disconnect between your internal clock and external demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What your body might be trying to tell you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tracking my sleep for months (yes, I became that person), patterns emerged. The nights I woke at 3 AM weren't random—they followed days of high stress, late-night screen time, or when I'd pushed through exhaustion instead of listening to my body's signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research backs this up. Studies show that chronic stress creates a vicious cycle: elevated cortisol disrupts sleep, poor sleep increases stress, and round and round we go. It's like being stuck in a biological escape room where the only exit is better sleep hygiene—which feels impossible when you can't sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's not just stress. These wake-ups can signal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accumulated sleep debt&lt;/strong&gt;: Your body cycles through sleep stages differently to compensate for chronic under-sleeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood sugar fluctuations&lt;/strong&gt;: Late-night snacks or skipped dinners can cause metabolic disruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circadian misalignment&lt;/strong&gt;: Your internal clock is out of sync with your lifestyle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormonal shifts&lt;/strong&gt;: Particularly relevant during perimenopause or other life transitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The recovery paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's where it gets frustrating: the research on "catching up" on sleep is mixed at best. That weekend sleep-in you're banking on? It might not fix the problem. One study found it takes &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/weekend-catch-up-sleep-wont-fix-the-effects-of-sleep-deprivation-on-your-waistline-2019092417861" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four days to recover&lt;/a&gt; from just one hour of lost sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science suggests that consistency matters more than marathon sleep sessions. Your circadian rhythm craves routine like a houseplant craves sunlight—regular, predictable, and at the right times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What actually works (based on science and self-experimentation)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of trial and error, here's what moved the needle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light is everything&lt;/strong&gt;: Our circadian rhythms evolved with natural light cycles. Getting bright light exposure within 30 minutes of waking and dimming lights 2-3 hours before bed made a bigger difference than any supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cortisol management game&lt;/strong&gt;: Since that 3 AM cortisol spike is inevitable, the goal is managing your baseline. Regular exercise (but not too late), stress-reduction practices that actually work for you (not just what Instagram wellness influencers suggest), and protecting your wind-down time all help keep that cortisol cup from overflowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temperature hacking&lt;/strong&gt;: Your body temperature naturally drops during sleep. Keeping the bedroom cool (around 65-68°F) and taking a warm shower before bed (the subsequent cooling mimics your natural temperature drop) can help maintain sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace your chronotype&lt;/strong&gt;: Stop fighting your genetics. If you're a natural night owl, trying to become a 5 AM workout person might be making things worse. Work with your biology, not against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those 3 AM wake-ups taught me something important: our bodies are constantly communicating with us, but we've gotten terrible at listening. In our always-on culture, we treat sleep like an inconvenience to optimize rather than a fundamental biological need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is clear: sleep isn't just about quantity—it's about quality, timing, and consistency. Those early morning wake-ups might be annoying, but they're also data points in understanding your body's needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After implementing these changes, my 3 AM wake-ups shifted from nightly occurrences to occasional visitors. More importantly, I stopped seeing them as failures and started seeing them as feedback. Sometimes I still find myself staring at the ceiling in the pre-dawn darkness, but now I know it's not just insomnia—it's biology trying to find balance in an unbalanced world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution isn't perfection; it's paying attention. Your body is remarkably good at self-regulation when you give it the right conditions. Those 3 AM wake-ups? They're not your enemy. They're your internal clock asking for a conversation about how you're living your days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe, just maybe, it's time we started listening.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="301" data-end="361"&gt;Let’s be real: waking up &lt;em data-start="326" data-end="337"&gt;refreshed&lt;/em&gt; is the new luxury flex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="363" data-end="576"&gt;In a world of hustle culture, 5 a.m. club influencers, and productivity gurus downing mushroom coffee, we’ve glorified early mornings—but no one’s talking about the stuff we do the &lt;em data-start="544" data-end="558"&gt;night before&lt;/em&gt; that wrecks them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="578" data-end="866"&gt;Sleep isn’t just about how many hours you get. It’s about &lt;em data-start="636" data-end="641"&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you wind down. And most of us are unknowingly doing things before bed that sabotage our sleep quality. Then we wake up groggy, drag ourselves through the day, and wonder if we need to cut carbs or start microdosing sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="868" data-end="944"&gt;Spoiler: You probably just need to stop doing these seven things before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="951" data-end="1004"&gt;1. &lt;strong data-start="958" data-end="1004"&gt;Doomscrolling like it’s your part-time job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1006" data-end="1305"&gt;Look, I get it. You open TikTok to check one recipe, and suddenly you’re 43 videos deep into “people who disappeared mysteriously and were never found.” Or worse, the algorithm hits you with a “clean girl” nighttime routine while you’re lying in three-day-old pajamas next to a half-eaten rice cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1307" data-end="1501"&gt;Doomscrolling might &lt;em data-start="1327" data-end="1333"&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like relaxing, but it’s mentally overstimulating. The constant hit of information—news, drama, opinions, memes—keeps your brain in high-alert mode, not wind-down mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1503" data-end="1800"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1503" data-end="1526"&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="1526" data-end="1529"&gt;Set a “digital sunset.” That means putting your phone on airplane mode or Do Not Disturb 30-60 minutes before bed. Replace the scroll with something analog—a book, journaling, or even stretching. Yes, it’ll feel weird at first. Withdrawal is real. But so is better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="1807" data-end="1874"&gt;2. &lt;strong data-start="1814" data-end="1874"&gt;Eating late-night snacks that mess with your sleep cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1876" data-end="2126"&gt;This one hurts me personally because I’ve been known to do late-night reviews of vegan cheesy puffs. But here’s the truth: what you eat before bed &lt;em data-start="2023" data-end="2032"&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;. Heavy meals, spicy food, and high-sugar snacks can disrupt your body’s natural sleep rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2128" data-end="2318"&gt;They mess with your digestion, blood sugar, and even core temperature—all things that impact how deeply you sleep and whether you wake up feeling like a slightly haunted version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2320" data-end="2556"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2320" data-end="2332"&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="2332" data-end="2335"&gt;If you &lt;em data-start="2342" data-end="2348"&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; snack, stick with something light and sleep-friendly: a banana with almond butter, a few walnuts, or chamomile tea with oat milk. Just don’t turn your bed into a snack lounge. Trust me, crumbs kill the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="2563" data-end="2605"&gt;3. &lt;strong data-start="2570" data-end="2605"&gt;Drinking alcohol to “wind down”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2607" data-end="2748"&gt;Ah yes, the sneaky one. Alcohol might &lt;em data-start="2645" data-end="2651"&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like a sedative—it helps you fall asleep faster—but it’s actually a sleep disruptor in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2750" data-end="2987"&gt;That glass of wine or nightcap lowers sleep quality, interrupts REM cycles, and often leads to 3 a.m. wakeups with a racing heart and regret. You might fall asleep quicker, but you’ll wake up feeling like you got hit by a kombucha truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2989" data-end="3208"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2989" data-end="3013"&gt;What to try instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="3013" data-end="3016"&gt;If you want a wind-down ritual, swap the booze for a calming alternative. I’m a fan of magnesium drinks, herbal teas, or even a vegan moon milk blend (yes, that’s a thing, and it’s delicious).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3215" data-end="3272"&gt;4. &lt;strong data-start="3222" data-end="3272"&gt;Taking your stress to bed with you (literally)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3274" data-end="3328"&gt;You can’t fight cortisol with a lavender pillow spray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3330" data-end="3529"&gt;If your mind is racing with thoughts like “Did I reply to that email?” or “Why did I say that thing in 2017?”—your body isn’t going to shift into sleep mode. You’re still mentally in fight-or-flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3531" data-end="3694"&gt;Many of us go from work to Netflix to bed without ever processing the stress of the day. That unprocessed energy doesn’t vanish—it just keeps spinning until 2 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3696" data-end="3937"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3696" data-end="3713"&gt;The solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="3713" data-end="3716"&gt;Introduce a “mental cleanse” before bed. This could be journaling, breathwork, or a simple brain dump—write down everything you’re thinking, even if it’s chaotic. Let the page hold your stress so your bed doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3944" data-end="4015"&gt;5. &lt;strong data-start="3951" data-end="4015"&gt;Having zero bedtime routine (and thinking it doesn’t matter)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4017" data-end="4075"&gt;Not having a routine is a routine—it just happens to suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4077" data-end="4261"&gt;Your body thrives on rhythm. If you’re crashing at different times each night, doing random things before bed, and expecting to sleep like a baby, you’re setting yourself up for chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4263" data-end="4354"&gt;Think of your bedtime routine as a signal to your body: “Hey, it’s safe to power down now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4356" data-end="4594"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4356" data-end="4374"&gt;What to build:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="4374" data-end="4377"&gt;Start small. Choose 2–3 calming things to do every night before bed: light stretching, skincare, reading, or listening to a calming playlist. (I’ve got a lo-fi Spotify mix called &lt;em data-start="4556" data-end="4574"&gt;"Sleepy Peaches"&lt;/em&gt; if you're curious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4596" data-end="4696"&gt;Once it becomes a ritual, your body will start recognizing the signs—and falling asleep gets easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="4703" data-end="4781"&gt;6. &lt;strong data-start="4710" data-end="4781"&gt;Using your bed as your office, dining table, or social media throne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4783" data-end="5007"&gt;This one’s for the WFH crew and the snackers (yes, I see you). When your bed becomes a place for eating, scrolling, working, and watching YouTube documentaries on mushroom farming, your brain stops associating it with sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5009" data-end="5136"&gt;It’s classic Pavlovian conditioning. If your brain links your bed with stimulation, you’ll lie down and feel wired, not sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5138" data-end="5332"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5138" data-end="5151"&gt;The move:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="5151" data-end="5154"&gt;Reclaim your bed as a &lt;em data-start="5176" data-end="5193"&gt;sleep-only zone&lt;/em&gt;. No laptops. No snacks. No reality TV. Treat your bed like a sacred space for rest—and maybe a little romance, but that’s another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5339" data-end="5412"&gt;7. &lt;strong data-start="5346" data-end="5412"&gt;Skipping wind-down movement because you think you’re too tired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5414" data-end="5654"&gt;Here’s a plot twist: light movement before bed can &lt;em data-start="5465" data-end="5474"&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; your sleep quality. Many people skip it thinking they need to stay still—but gentle movement can help release tension, calm your nervous system, and transition you into rest mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5656" data-end="5805"&gt;You don’t need to do a full yoga flow. Even 5 minutes of deep breathing while lying on your back with your legs up against the wall can work wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5807" data-end="5831"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5807" data-end="5829"&gt;Try this sequence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5832" data-end="5979"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5832" data-end="5898"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5834" data-end="5898"&gt;1 minute of box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5899" data-end="5934"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5901" data-end="5934"&gt;2 minutes legs-up-the-wall pose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5935" data-end="5979"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5937" data-end="5979"&gt;2 minutes of neck or shoulder rolls in bed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5981" data-end="6054"&gt;You’ll be surprised how much more grounded—and sleepy—you feel afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6061" data-end="6128"&gt;Bonus: The mindset trap of “I’ll just push through it tomorrow”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6130" data-end="6202"&gt;This one isn’t a habit so much as a belief system. And it’s a toxic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6204" data-end="6410"&gt;The idea that you can always catch up, power through, or caffeinate your way into productivity? It’s a myth. Chronic sleep sabotage catches up with you. You’re not weak for needing good sleep. You’re human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6412" data-end="6590"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6412" data-end="6440"&gt;Reframing the narrative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="6440" data-end="6443"&gt;You’re not being lazy by prioritizing rest. You’re being &lt;em data-start="6500" data-end="6511"&gt;strategic&lt;/em&gt;. Sleep is the foundation for everything else: focus, creativity, energy, mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6592" data-end="6669"&gt;So let’s stop treating it like an afterthought. Let it be the main character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6676" data-end="6740"&gt;Final thoughts from someone who’s tried all the wrong things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6742" data-end="6890"&gt;I’ve spent too many nights up late reviewing vegan protein cookies and convincing myself that three hours of sleep was “fine.” (Spoiler: it wasn’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6892" data-end="7169"&gt;But once I started changing these bedtime habits—even just one at a time—I stopped waking up feeling like a knocked-over succulent. I felt rested, energized, even &lt;em data-start="7055" data-end="7064"&gt;excited&lt;/em&gt; to get out of bed. (Which is wild, considering I’m not a morning person unless a new lo-fi album drops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7171" data-end="7269"&gt;So here’s my challenge to you: pick one of these habits and say goodbye to it this week. Just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7271" data-end="7295"&gt;Then watch what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7297" data-end="7360"&gt;You might just wake up one morning and realize—you feel &lt;em data-start="7353" data-end="7359"&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7362" data-end="7407"&gt;Like, naturally good. No adaptogens required.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The internet's latest health villain has arrived, and it's hiding in your kitchen cabinet. Seed oils—canola, soy, sunflower, and their botanical brethren—are being blamed for everything from brain fog to heart disease. Social media influencers call them the "Hateful Eight," while wellness gurus claim they're more toxic than industrial waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: &lt;strong&gt;the science doesn't back up the hysteria.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's Really Going On Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-seed oil movement gained steam around 2020, largely thanks to carnivore diet advocates appearing on popular podcasts. The basic argument goes like this: these oils are processed with chemicals, they're high in omega-6 fatty acids, and they're supposedly causing widespread inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds scary. Also sounds like the kind of oversimplified narrative that thrives on social media but crumbles under scientific scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evidence Actually Says...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250621103446.htm" target="_blank"&gt;2025 study analyzing blood markers from nearly 1,900 people&lt;/a&gt; found that higher levels of linoleic acid—the omega-6 fat that seed oil critics love to hate—were actually &lt;strong&gt;linked to lower inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;, not higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2024/08/20/theres-no-reason-to-avoid-seed-oils-and-plenty-of-reasons-to-eat-them" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; states there's "no reason to avoid seed oils and plenty of reasons to eat them." &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/scientists-debunk-seed-oil-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard researchers&lt;/a&gt; have pushed back on claims that these oils cause health problems ranging from headaches to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more telling: a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/article/seed-oils-facts-myths" target="_blank"&gt;2017 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; found that increased dietary intake of linoleic acid doesn't significantly affect blood concentrations of inflammatory markers. Only about 0.2% of omega-6s actually convert to the compounds that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; theoretically cause inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Real Culprits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what the seed oil panic gets wrong: it confuses correlation with causation. Yes, many foods containing seed oils are unhealthy—think french fries, packaged snacks, and processed junk. But these foods are also loaded with refined carbohydrates, sodium, and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/scientists-debunk-seed-oil-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard's Guy Crosby notes&lt;/a&gt;: "Sure, if you cut back on these foods, chances are you're going to feel better." But it's not the seed oils causing the problems—it's the overall nutritional disaster that is ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Processing Panic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics often point to hexane, a chemical solvent used in oil extraction, as evidence of toxicity. While hexane can be hazardous in gas form, it's used as a liquid solvent and then evaporated off. The EPA studied hexane extensively in the 1980s and found it safe for consumption in the trace amounts that might remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, mechanically extracted oils (cold-pressed, expeller-pressed) exist for those who prefer to avoid chemical processing entirely. They're more expensive and have shorter shelf lives, but they're available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://public-health.uq.edu.au/article/2024/02/if-you%E2%80%99re-worried-about-inflammation-stop-stressing-about-seed-oils-and-focus-basics" target="_blank"&gt;University of Queensland's research&lt;/a&gt; puts it best: if you're worried about inflammation, "stop stressing about seed oils and focus on the basics."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those basics? Eat more fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and lean proteins. Reduce ultra-processed foods. Get adequate omega-3s from fatty fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds. Exercise regularly. Manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revolutionary stuff, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Political Angle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that opposition to seed oils has become oddly politicized. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_oil_misinformation" target="_blank"&gt;Wikipedia documents&lt;/a&gt; how the movement has been "associated with the political right," with some academics describing it as part of "right-wing masculinist discourse."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When health advice becomes a political identity marker, you know you've wandered far from actual science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can seed oils be part of a healthy diet? Absolutely. &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/article/seed-oils-facts-myths" target="_blank"&gt;Mass General's research&lt;/a&gt; shows they can be beneficial when used in cooking—stir-frying vegetables, roasting fish, making homemade salad dressings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1502815/full" target="_blank" title=""&gt;systematic review published in Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found that seed oils from canola, flaxseed, and sesame can positively influence lipid profiles and glycemic control while potentially reducing oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Actually Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of obsessing over specific oils, focus on the bigger picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat mostly whole foods&lt;/strong&gt; rather than processed ones&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include omega-3 rich foods&lt;/strong&gt; like fatty fish and walnuts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a variety of fats&lt;/strong&gt; including olive oil, avocados, nuts, and yes, seed oils&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook at home more often&lt;/strong&gt; so you control what goes into your food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seed oil panic is a perfect example of how complex nutritional science gets reduced to clickbait headlines and social media soundbites. While the influencers are busy demonizing canola oil, the real dietary villains—ultra-processed foods, excessive sugar, and overall poor eating patterns—continue doing actual damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save your energy for the fights that matter.&lt;/strong&gt; Your health will thank you for focusing on evidence-based nutrition rather than the latest internet panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to reduce inflammation? Skip the seed oil hysteria and eat more vegetables. Revolutionary, I know.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers used deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants to track neural activity before and after 12 sessions of dynamic cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no immediate changes were seen, significant alterations in motor-related brain signals appeared by the end of the program. The findings suggest that exercise may induce broader network-level changes in the brain, helping to restore connections disrupted by Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Rewiring:&lt;/strong&gt; After 12 cycling sessions, brain signals in motor regions changed measurably.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; Smart bikes adjusted resistance in real time to maximize engagement and motor benefit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network-Level Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings hint at brain-wide rewiring beyond the DBS implant zone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was the early 2000s when researchers first showed that exercise can help relieve the tremors that are common with Parkinson’s Disease. So far, researchers haven’t been able to explain how exercise helps. But they may be getting closer to an answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel study conducted at University Hospitals and the VA Northeast Ohio Healthcare System, through its Cleveland Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Center, provides clues, as it shows that long-term dynamic exercise programs might have wider restorative effects on the brain signals of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients than researchers previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112073"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/parkinsons-exercise-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/parkinsons-exercise-brain-neuroscience-300x233.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/parkinsons-exercise-brain-neuroscience-770x599.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/parkinsons-exercise-brain-neuroscience-293x228.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/parkinsons-exercise-brain-neuroscience-150x117.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/parkinsons-exercise-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man on an exercise bike in a hospital.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used recordings from participants’ deep brain stimulation devices to try to assess how long-term exercise programs might be re-activating connections damaged by Parkinson’s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous studies, this investigation sought to decode the brain changes linked to motor symptom relief; both with the help of second-generation DBS devices and a long-term dynamic cycling exercise regimen in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details on the study are published in the June 2025 issue of &lt;em&gt;Clinical Neurophysiology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilot investigation, funded by a VA Merit Award from the Department of Veterans Affairs along with philanthropic funds to the Department of Neurology at University Hospitals (Penni and Stephen Weinberg Chair in Brain Health) was led by UH &amp;amp; VA neurologist Aasef Shaikh MD, PhD, who is also Vice Chair for Research at University Hospitals, Professor of Neurology, and Associate Medical Director of the Cleveland FES Center. Prajakta Joshi, lead author of the article, is a PhD candidate in biomedical engineering at the Shaikh Lab that is part of University Hospitals and Cleveland FES Center at the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already established over years of study that dynamic cycling regimens are beneficial for treating Parkinson’s tremor,” said Dr. Shaikh. “The latest study adds the use of deep brain stimulation and an ongoing exercise program to visualize how long-term exercise might be rewiring neural connections in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another unique and critical part of the study, Dr. Shaikh added, was the collaboration between the two medical systems, which provided a larger pool of potential participants for recruiting purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with Parkinson’s Disease – including military Veterans – were required to take part in 12 dynamic cycling sessions over a four-week period. All study participants had previously been implanted with deep brain stimulation devices to treat their motor symptoms; while simultaneously measuring the brain signals in the region where the electrodes are implanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another critical aspect of the study was the adaptive cycling regimen investigators used. This technology empowers the bike to learn how patients perform while biking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, viewing the connected game screen, riders are instructed to pedal up to 80 rpm, and to maintain that speed for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, their pedaling intensity is shown by an on-screen balloon, and riders have to keep the balloon aloft over water but within specific parameters on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the adaptive quality of the bike keeps riders guessing as to how much effort to apply. The bike’s motor assists them in attaining 80 rpm, but also adds and reduces resistance depending on the rider’s level of effort. Researchers believe this push and pull mechanism is particularly beneficial in treating Parkinson’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent State University PhD candidate Lara Shigo, a co-author of the study, acknowledges 80 RPMs is faster than a person would naturally choose to ride, but says the level doesn’t cause fatigue because the bike’s motor assists the rider in attaining that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exciting Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain signal recordings were captured from participants’ implanted DBS electrodes to assess participants’ brain signals before and after each exercise session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal was to understand the immediate and long-term effects of the exercise in that region of the brain where the electrodes are implanted, which is also the same area where Parkinson’s pathology is evident,” Dr. Shaikh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers did not observe immediate brain signal changes, but after 12 sessions, they saw a measurable change in the brain signals responsible for motor control and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshi and the team observed that while modern DBS systems offer a novel window into brain activity, they are limited to capturing signals only from the regions where the electrodes are implanted. As a result, other brain areas that may also contribute to the observed patterns could remain unmonitored.                               &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key insight, Joshi explains: “There may be a broader circuit involved. Numerous upstream and downstream pathways could be influenced by exercise, and it’s possible that we’re inducing a network-level change that drives the improvement in motor symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional work could help provide answers, Joshi adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that our next investigations could bring us closer to revolutionary and personalized treatments for PD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patient Success&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda “Mandy” Ensman, 59, was diagnosed with PD 12 years ago and participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew I needed to start exercising. It really does make a difference,” she explained. “Biking helped me with a variety of symptoms I was struggling with, including my gait, walking and increased my energy levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandy now regularly participates in physical therapy regularly at InMotion, where the study took place. The gym holds workout classes and programs that are geared specifically towards PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise, neurogenesis, and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88e9e6fbe4edf1a6e3ede4e5c8fde0e0e7fbf8e1fce9e4fba6e7faef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ansley Kelm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uhhospitals.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ansley Kelm – University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2025.03.018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Electrophysiological correlates of dynamic cycling in Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Aasef Shaikh et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical Neurophysiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrophysiological correlates of dynamic cycling in Parkinson’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="st015"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical exercise like dynamic cycling has shown promise in enhancing motor function in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We examined the underlying mechanisms of dynamic cycling in PD, emphasizing its impact on the activity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a pivotal region within the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="st020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation involved 100 dynamic cycling sessions conducted among nine PD individuals. Each participant underwent a maximum of 12 sessions over a four-week period. Local field potentials (LFPs) originating from the STN were recorded before and after cycling, utilizing DBS electrodes positioned within the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated both immediate and sustained impacts of dynamic cycling on LFP. The periodic LFP activity was assessed by determining the dominant spectral frequency and the power associated with that frequency. Aperiodic LFP activity was analyzed by calculating the 1/f exponent of the power spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="st025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediate and sustained effects of dynamic cycling on LFPs were evaluated.

These individuals also show a stronger preference for stimulating music, regardless of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity. It often begins in childhood and persists into adulthood in a significant proportion of cases. Adults with ADHD, especially those with the inattentive presentation, may struggle with sustained attention, task management, and organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disorder is also commonly associated with emotional challenges such as anxiety or depression. While stimulant medication can help regulate brain arousal and improve performance, researchers have also explored alternative strategies to support individuals with attentional difficulties, including environmental adjustments like background music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, doctoral candidates Kelly-Ann Lachance and Pénélope Pelland-Goulet, along with clinical neuropsychologist and full professor &lt;a href="https://www.musec.ca/en/frlaboratoire-musecenmusec-laboratory-english/" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Gosselin&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Montreal, sought to understand how young adults use music in daily life and whether those with ADHD symptoms differ from neurotypical individuals in their listening habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in how young adults with and without ADHD use background music during daily activities, especially those requiring more cognitive effort, since prior lab studies rarely examine real-world listening habits,” the researchers explained. “Given that individuals with ADHD often struggle with attention, we wanted to understand whether they listen to music differently in everyday contexts. This interest was sparked years ago when a parent of a teenager with attention difficulties once asked Dr. Gosselin if letting their child study with music was a good idea—an unanswered question that stayed with her ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted an online survey with 434 participants between the ages of 17 and 30. Participants answered questions about their music listening habits, musical preferences, and the perceived effects of background music on emotional and cognitive functioning. The survey also included a standardized screening tool for ADHD symptoms. Based on the responses, participants were divided into two groups: those who screened positive for ADHD and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that most young adults listen to background music during both cognitively demanding tasks—such as studying, problem-solving, and reading—and less demanding ones like cleaning, cooking, and exercising. However, individuals in the ADHD-screened group reported more frequent use of background music while studying and exercising compared to the neurotypical group. They also listened more frequently to music during low-effort activities overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, distinct differences emerged between groups,” the researchers told PsyPost. “ADHD-screened participants not only listened to music more often during study tasks but also preferred stimulating music across both more and less cognitively demanding activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, neurotypical participants tended to favor relaxing music during cognitively demanding activities and more stimulating music during less demanding ones. This pattern highlights a clear difference in how music is used and perceived—not just casually, but as a strategy to meet stimulation needs. It was interesting to see that these self-regulatory uses of music are already present in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings align with existing psychological theories. One of them, the Moderate Brain Arousal model, suggests that individuals with ADHD often experience lower baseline levels of brain arousal. They may use external stimulation—such as music—to help reach an optimal arousal state that supports task engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimulating music, by activating the brain’s reward system and releasing dopamine, could help compensate for this baseline deficit and reduce tendencies toward mind-wandering or distraction during tasks like studying. In contrast, neurotypical individuals may seek less stimulation and favor music that is more calming or predictable when engaging in complex work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated whether participants believed that background music improved their concentration or mood during cognitive tasks. Using a set of 27 statements, they conducted a factor analysis and identified two distinct dimensions of subjective experience: one related to cognitive functioning and the other to emotional functioning. Most participants reported that music helped with both, citing enhanced concentration and improved mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expectations, there were no significant differences between groups in how they rated the emotional or cognitive benefits of background music. This suggests that despite listening more often to music in daily life, ADHD-screened individuals do not necessarily perceive stronger effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that young adults with ADHD symptoms tend to listen to background music more frequently during activities that demand concentration, and they usually prefer more stimulating music, regardless of the activity type (e.g., more and less cognitively demanding),” the researchers said. “Many participants—both young adults with ADHD symptoms and neurotypical—also reported that music helped them stay focused and improved their mood. This suggests that background music might be a way for some people to manage their attention and emotions in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took care to account for potential confounding factors in their analysis. They controlled for variables such as musical training and mood symptoms and found that group differences in listening habits remained significant. For instance, even after adjusting for emotional distress, participants with ADHD symptoms still reported higher music use while exercising or doing simple tasks. This pattern suggests that the behavior is not solely driven by emotional coping but may also be related to attentional strategies or arousal regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are still some limitations to consider. One key limitation was the reliance on self-report data, which may be subject to recall bias or social desirability effects. In addition, the ADHD status of participants was determined through a screening questionnaire rather than a clinical diagnosis. This method may have included individuals with subclinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study adds to a growing body of evidence that music plays a meaningful role in how people manage attention and emotion in daily life. For individuals with attentional challenges, music may serve as a flexible and self-directed tool to help regulate arousal, reduce boredom, and support performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by using laboratory experiments or examining how different types of music affect cognitive performance and emotional state in individuals with ADHD. Longitudinal studies might also explore how music habits evolve over time or interact with other coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the short term, we have just launched a new survey targeting a younger population (ages 12 to 17) to explore their background music listening habits during daily activities,” the researchers said. “In English: https://ls.sondages.umontreal.ca/229667. In French: https://ls.sondages.umontreal.ca/978117.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As for long-term goals, a key next step would be to examine how specific musical characteristics—such as tempo, lyrics, or familiarity—influence attention and emotional regulation in real time. Future research should be interested in developing personalized music-based strategies that could help individuals with attentional difficulties in academic or work settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reflect what many people may already sense intuitively: music is not just background noise—it plays a role in how we manage our attention, mood, and motivation,” the researchers added. “Understanding these everyday habits could help guide more individualized and practical approaches to supporting mental health and focus, especially in people with ADHD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1508181" target="_blank"&gt;Listening habits and subjective effects of background music in young adults with and without ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Kelly-Ann Lachance Pénélope Pelland-Goulet, and Nathalie Gosselin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 18:07:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOWjc0enpKR1RBY3RhaFY1bGZIVzBXWlZfRTRvS0JMN01tdmF4aURyaFZpOUYxRXNsWU9jNVI3WHEtUkk0V2NMd1V4Mm04bmpyNmhfSW5EaGMyeGhIRFhEM21YQzhSMEo4UG9ISzlJWUtXNnpPZVhiQ201U1U1U3dSX3NmY0N0TzNTdlVKOFVJQm1MZ3FPV2tEUmQzd3pDc3M</guid></item><item><title>根据心脏病专家的说法，这是强化心脏的最佳日常习惯- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9HWkwyM3dIWjFvSnhtTGNJLWNBNWJXcjRzd21GbENrQzhmWUFsYVJmRzNheDZLVjdHZ3ozTEt0ek82NHc2MHYzdVFtcTR4emNrNmIydFRPS200SkR0Nk1taXJubU5uYUlKZENmTENFUEoyU3hwWTQ0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-daily-habit-to-strengthen-heart-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Is the Best Daily Habit To Strengthen Your Heart, According to Cardiologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Is the Best Daily Habit To Strengthen Your Heart, According to Cardiologists&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://parade.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to look too far into the future.

"There is no doubt from my view that bringing weight training is crucial to developing a balanced exercise regimen," Dr. Sathyamoorthy reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt in the American Heart Association's mind either. The organization recommends that adults engage in strength training at least two days per week in its &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guidelines for physical activity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guidelines for physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is often overlooked as people focus more heavily on the also-important recommendations for aerobic activity (150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you may know that weight training can help build and maintain muscle. The heart is also a muscle. However, pumping iron doesn't benefit the heart in the same way—you're not going to make your ticker bulkier by lifting weights or doing bodyweight squats..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strength training...can help create a more conducive environment for the heart to work within," explains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getcare.tgh.org/providers/debbie-rinde-hoffman-1801899091" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Debbie Rinde-Hoffman, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Debbie Rinde-Hoffman, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a cardiologist and vice chief of business development with Tampa General Hospital Heart &amp;amp; Vascular Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, strength training makes the body stronger, and the heart doesn't operate in a vacuum—it benefits too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strength training can lower weight, improve cholesterol and blood sugar and can improve blood pressure," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-guy-lowell-mintz-md-1508869884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Guy L.

Mintz, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the director of cardiovascular health &amp;amp; lipidology for the Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital and North Shore University Hospital. "Weight training builds lean muscle mass, and muscle burns more calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mintz notes that this &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1371324/kaitlin-vogel/calories-burned-running/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:calorie burn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;calorie burn&lt;/a&gt; continues even after the resistance workout (known as the "afterburn effect"). Speaking of "continues," the list of benefits strength training has for heart health doesn't stop there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also helps enhance insulin sensitivity, weight management, reduces inflammation and has a positive effect on our mood and sleep," states &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/saleem-husain/1316861" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Saleem Husain, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Saleem Husain, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist at JFK University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/popular-nighttime-habit-that-spikes-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Popular Nighttime Habit Could Spike Your Blood Pressure, Cardiologists Warn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Popular Nighttime Habit Could Spike Your Blood Pressure, Cardiologists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for Strength Training for a Stronger Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are tons of advice and workout plans available online, which are handy when starting a workout regimen. However, Dr. Mintz stresses that people looking to start strength training for a stronger heart should remember to "make it fun." Customization is also key based on your goals and experience. Here's what cardiologists recommend if you're trying to ramp up your strength training efforts for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Know what qualifies as strength training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: It doesn't require a gym membership (but you might benefit from one if you like to use equipment that you don't have at home).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything that increases muscle activity above normal activity [qualifies as strength training]," Dr. Mintz explains. "This can include weights and resistance bands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Husain notes that body weight moves also count—think push-ups, crunches, and squats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Work different muscle groups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists advise people to engage all their muscle groups each week. You might work the upper body, core, and lower body on separate days or opt for a full-body session three times a week. It is a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One method is to break up exercise into body sections," Dr. Sathyamoorthy says. "The other is to do circuit training, where you use machines to work each part of the body, repeating each full round two to three times for a good workout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sathyamoorthy adds that a bodyweight circuit approach, incorporating exercises such as push-ups, leg lifts, and squats, also works. "It's up to you, your goals and your comfort level," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Understand how long to strength train for heart health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association makes specific recommendations for duration and intensity of aerobic exercise, but doesn't do the same for resistance efforts. Dr. Rinde-Hoffman says there's not a cookie-cutter answer to questions like, "How long should I strength train for my heart?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It might look different for individuals depending on their age, sex, degree of physical conditioning and underlying medical conditions," Dr. Rinde-Hoffman points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Husain recommends tacking on 15 to 20 minutes of strength training to cardio workouts two to three times each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Go slow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists recommend easing into resistance training if you're a beginner or if it's been a while. "I usually recommend training with low-level weights, which you can use without having to hold your breath," Dr. Husain says, who adds it's important to warm up and cool down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ensure you can keep your posture throughout the set. "Correct form is key to avoiding injury," Dr. Mintz advises. "Do not jerk the weights." He adds that a personal trainer can help ensure you keep good form, and he suggests gradually increasing weight as your body can tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/first-moves-trainers-teach-clients-for-stronger-core" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The First 2 Moves Trainers Teach Clients Who Want a Stronger Core;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The First 2 Moves Trainers Teach Clients Who Want a Stronger Core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Advice&lt;/strong&gt; for a Stronger Heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rinde-Hoffman emphasizes working every avenue you can to keep your heart as healthy as possible. She suggests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing underlying conditions, including high cholesterol and blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding other cardiovascular risk factors, like family history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting regular aerobic exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing interpersonal connections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprised to see the last one about connection there? "Prioritizing interpersonal connections with others is also helpful in promoting good heart health by reducing stress, promoting healthier lifestyle choices and improving overall mental health," she reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mintz's key takeaway about heart health and lifestyle habits takes a similar route. "Cardiovascular benefits are increased when done together," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-people-with-high-cholesterol-should-break-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Cardiologists Are Begging People With High Cholesterol To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: Cardiologists Are Begging People With High Cholesterol To Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mohanakrishna Sathyamoorthy, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Mohanakrishna Sathyamoorthy, MD&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of the department of internal medicine and Burnett School of Medicine and the principal cardiologist with Consultants in Cardiovascular Medicine and Science Fort Worth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Heart Association Recommendations for Physical Activity in Adults and Kids. &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getcare.tgh.org/providers/debbie-rinde-hoffman-1801899091" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Debbie Rinde-Hoffman, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Debbie Rinde-Hoffman, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist and vice chief of business development with Tampa General Hospital Heart &amp;amp; Vascular Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-guy-lowell-mintz-md-1508869884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Guy L.

&lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals rely on particular genes to adjust their metabolisms as they enter that unique, low-energy state — and humans actually carry that same hibernation-related DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, early research hints that leveraging this particular DNA could help treat medical conditions in people, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hibernation offers "a whole bunch of different biometrically important superpowers," senior study author&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/christopher-t-gregg" target="_blank" data-url="https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/christopher-t-gregg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Christopher Gregg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a human genetics professor at the University of Utah, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, ground squirrels can develop reversible &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that helps them rapidly gain weight before they hibernate but starts fading as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3854349/#sec1" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3854349/#sec1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hibernation gets underway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A better understanding of how hibernators flip this switch could be useful for tackling the insulin resistance that characterizes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gregg suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hibernating animals also protect their nervous systems from damage that could be caused by sudden changes in blood flow. "When they come out of hibernation, their brain is reperfused with blood," Gregg said. "Often that would cause a lot of damage, like a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stroke&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but they've developed ways to prevent that damage from happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg and his colleagues think tapping into hibernation-related genes in people could unlock similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/best-ever-map-of-the-human-genome-sheds-light-on-jumping-genes-junk-dna-and-more" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/best-ever-map-of-the-human-genome-sheds-light-on-jumping-genes-junk-dna-and-more"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best-ever map of the human genome sheds light on 'jumping genes,' 'junk DNA' and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-7AZkmdVBg48FvFTEd52Fy3" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-7AZkmdVBg48FvFTEd52Fy3 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-hub-of-hibernation-genes-3"&gt;A 'hub' of hibernation genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a pair of studies published Thursday (July 31) in the journal Science, Gregg and his team pinpointed key levers that control genes related to hibernation, showing how they &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4025" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4025" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;differ between animals that hibernate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and those that don't. Then, in the lab experiments, they delved into the effects of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4701" data-url="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4701" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;deleting these levers in lab mice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although mice don't &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/54982-why-do-animals-hibernate.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/54982-why-do-animals-hibernate.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hibernate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they can enter torpor — a lethargic state of decreased metabolism, movement and body temperature that typically lasts for less than a day — after fasting for at least six hours. This made mice a suitable genetic model for studying these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the gene-editing technique&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt; &lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists engineered mice with one of five conserved noncoding cis elements (CREs) deactivated, or "knocked out." These CREs act as levers to control genes that, in turn, code for proteins that carry out biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CREs targeted in the study lie near a gene cluster called the "fat mass and obesity-related locus," or the FTO locus, which is also found in humans. Gene variants found within the cluster have been tied to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10404889/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10404889/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an elevated risk of obesity and related conditions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Broadly speaking, the FTO locus is known to be important for controlling metabolism, energy expenditure and body mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By knocking out the CREs, the researchers were able to change the mice's weights, metabolic rates and foraging behaviors. Some deletions sped up or slowed down weight gain, others turned metabolic rate up or down, and some affected how quickly the mice's body temperatures recovered after torpor, the researchers said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092569" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092569" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding is "highly promising," particularly given the FTO locus plays a well-known role in human obesity, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uaf.edu/chem/files/kdrew/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uaf.edu/chem/files/kdrew/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kelly Drew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist on hibernation biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knocking out one CRE — called E1 — in female mice caused them to gain more weight on a high-fat diet than did a comparison group with all of their DNA intact. Deleting a different CRE, called E3, changed the foraging behavior of both male and female mice, specifically changing how they searched for food hidden in an arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that important differences in foraging and decision processes may exist between hibernators and non-hibernators and the elements we uncovered might be involved," Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="unknowns-to-address-3"&gt;Unknowns to address&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors said their results could be relevant to humans, since the underlying genes don't differ much between mammals. "It's how [the mammals] turn those genes on and off at different times and then for different durations and in different combinations that shape different species," Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "it's definitely not as simple as introducing the same changes in human DNA," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evogenomes.sites.ucsc.edu/people/lab-members/" target="_blank" data-url="https://evogenomes.sites.ucsc.edu/people/lab-members/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joanna Kelley&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor who specialises in functional genomics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told Live Science in an email. "Humans are not capable of fasting-induced torpor, which is the reason why mice are used in these studies," said Kelley, who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggested that future work include animals incapable of torpor, and focus on unpacking all the downstream effects of the deleted CREs. As is, the current study "definitely points the field in a new direction" in terms of how scientists understand the genetic controls driving changes in hibernators throughout the year, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew also highlighted that torpor in mice is triggered by fasting, while true hibernation is triggered by hormonal and seasonal changes and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-a-circadian-rhythm" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-a-circadian-rhythm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;internal clocks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So while the CREs and genes the study identified are likely critical parts of a metabolic "toolkit" that responds to fasting, they may not be a "master switch" that turns hibernation on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevertheless, uncovering these fundamental mechanisms in a tractable model like the mouse is an invaluable stepping stone for future research," Drew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg emphasized that much remains unknown, including why the effects of some deletions differed in female mice versus male mice or how the changes in foraging behavior seen in mice might manifest in humans. The team also plans to research what would happen if they deleted more than one hibernation-linked CRE at a time in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the line, Gregg thinks it could be possible to tweak the activity of humans' "hibernation hub genes" with drugs. The idea would be that this approach could yield the benefits of that gene activity — like neuroprotection — without patients having to actually hibernate, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Mexico's poorest and southernmost state of Chiapas, fizzy drinks are deeply ingrained in the local culture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mexico's children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation's childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the town of San Cristobal de las Casas, the obsession has spiralled out of control, with some residents guzzling up to two litres of Coca-Cola every single day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Just 7 per cent of households in Chiapas believe their water is safe to drink, according to a 2023 national survey, forcing many to buy bottled water or the fizzy drink, which is just as cheap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But Coca-Cola's popularity has led to a 'catastrophic' obesity crisis in Chiapas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, Coca-Cola has flooded the market and has become embedded in Mexico's daily life and culture.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Coca-Cola's popularity has led to a 'catastrophic' obesity crisis in Chiapas, health officials say, with several residents now suffering from Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mexico's children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation's childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40 per cent of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2020 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed Mexico stands to lose the greatest amount of life expectancy - an average of at least four years - due to obesity-related problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In coming years, the country could lose over five percent of its GDP to obesity-related problems, including lost work hours and health costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health authorities say about 39 per cent of Mexicans are overweight and 36 per cent are obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

It's one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colon and rectum are both parts of the large intestine, which is part of the digestive system. Colorectal cancer often begins as a growth called a polyp inside the colon or rectum. Most colorectal cancers are curable when localized to the bowel. However, recurrence following surgery is a major problem and is often the ultimate cause of death. Colorectal cancer can develop when cells in the colon or rectum change and no longer behave normally. These changes can lead to precancerous conditions, such as adenomas, or colorectal cancer itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common type of colorectal cancer is adenocarcinoma, which starts in the gland cells that line the colon or rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer, the most common gastrointestinal cancer, disproportionately affects Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and Asian populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, colon cancer impacts more than 100,000 Americans every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, healthcare providers are relentlessly trying to draw our attention to the kind of lifestyle—including dietary habits, workouts, and sleeping patterns—that could be our ally in order to prevent colon cancer, especially in young adults. In this fight to prevent this aggressive type of cancer, nature’s basket must be our go-to, instead of processed and ultra-processed foods. A US-based Gastroenterologist, Joseph Salhab, D.O., recently shared a list of nutrition-packed fruits and vegetables that have been shown to reduce colon cancer risk, per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruits to reduce the risk of colon cancer (when and how to eat them)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Watermelon&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than just a summertime favorite, watermelon may offer real health benefits, including &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a 26% reduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in colon cancer risk with regular consumption, according to recent findings. Gastroenterologists recommend the fruit for its high lycopene content, a powerful antioxidant believed to protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best time to eat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mid‑morning or afternoon snack, to both hydrate and curb cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spruce it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Dr. Salhab highlights, watermelon is also incredibly hydrating, which supports digestive health and promotes regular bowel movements. Try it in savory dishes like a Watermelon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Feta Salad, or enjoy its natural sweetness in a refreshing No-Churn Watermelon Ice Cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apples&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saying "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" may hold more truth than expected. Rich in gut-friendly fiber, apples have been shown to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;reduce colon cancer risk by 25%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; when consumed in higher amounts. They also contain polyphenols, which Dr. Salhab notes offer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best time to eat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raw as breakfast or after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spruce it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apples are not only portable and satisfying on their own, but also versatile in meals, from salads and overnight oats to a classic snack with peanut butter for a fiber and protein-rich combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kiwi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a potential to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;lower colorectal cancer risk by 13%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, kiwi is another fruit that shines in both nutrition and taste. Dr. Salhab calls it an excellent source of fiber, helping to support digestion. It’s also loaded with vitamin C, which plays a role in immune function, heart health, and skin repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best time to eat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; With breakfast or as part of fruit bowls to kickstart digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spruce it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; While kiwi adds brightness to fruit salads and yogurt bowls, it also pairs beautifully with savory fare, like in Easy Fish Tacos with Kiwi Salsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including more citrus fruits in your diet, such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, and tangerines, may also contribute to lower colon cancer risk, with studies showing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a 9% decrease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; linked to higher citrus intake. These fruits are loaded with vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant to help neutralize free radicals and possibly minimize DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best time to eat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fresh citrus juice or whole fruit in the morning or midday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spruce it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citrus also provides flavonoids, a type of polyphenol that may slow aging, reduce inflammation, and support cancer prevention. Celebrate warm weather and gut health with a Citrus Salad with Pomegranate &amp;amp; Mint, or repurpose scraps into a zero-waste Orange Peel Smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why fruits are a great ally in cancer prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dietary fiber and plant-based foods are known to reduce colorectal cancer risk, not all fruits are equal. A 2023 meta-analysis found protective associations specifically for citrus, apples, watermelon, and kiwi. Compared to a low intake:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Watermelon reduced risk by 26%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Apples by 25%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Kiwi by 13%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Citrus by 9%, with an optimal intake of around 120 g/day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that while fruit can play a supportive role, no single food can prevent or cure cancer. An amalgamation of protective habits, like consuming a high-fiber, plant-rich diet, combined with exercise, well-managed weight, and minimal alcohol, is essential. High-fiber, plant-rich diets are associated with significantly lower colorectal cancer risk; every extra 10 grams of fiber daily may reduce risk by about 7%. Cutting processed and red meats, sugary drinks, ultraprocessed foods, and limiting alcohol is essential, increasing risk by up to 40% in some studies. Furthermore, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly helps reduce inflammation and the risk of digestive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>健康专家警告Benadryl可能没有想象的那么有用- NewsNation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE1sTFNXejlXTXkydTZLVkI3ekRJdHk3b1NZZHFYMzVkSURNYndTbUMzZG5POFEyNnYzNGw1aTlyNEQ0Mk9EX25kSXoyOUJHVktSSFBXaW9sS2JYbGduUUM2MFhlX2g3M0pCd3RwbUhhU2dJZGg3OVHSAXtBVV95cUxNakY3NmJBeGNIY2FaQ0xSbU9Yc0pHMW5fb1E3OHFac05LSDRFUEFhQlpPWlpWTEd1b0VneE1wZy1PTGdvcDZaNHlVblBtam01ZzYyemI5LU9relF1RFVOaU45WkV5TmlZUXplLUxicS11MjdXTEltVWNveXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

He’d tried steroid injections and PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injections, which Mehta said eventually did the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RCRPEWANCRCSJLCTS2V7RNEGYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But when his right Achilles started hurting three months later, he opted for a different approach. He had recently started offering low-dose radiation therapy to treat some patients suffering from inflammatory conditions and thought: Why not try it himself? After six self-administered low-dose X-rays, covered by insurance, he found he was pain-free — and he began offering the therapy to more patients with similar noncancerous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JIJKXU6OZBH2XBNBFAPMOCHNJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The main surprise was … why didn’t I think of this earlier?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JUOZQZY6HZFKHD3NYETA4YZZSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mehta is part of a growing trend among U.S. radiation specialists, who have begun offering low-dose X-ray therapy for benign conditions such as arthritis, &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/plantar-fasciitis" target="_blank"&gt;plantar fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peyronies-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353468" target="_blank"&gt;Peyronie’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and thick raised scars, or keloids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="65GZA3D23BEWXPCC5SLKJPXKUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After the American Society for Radiation Oncology discussed the use of low-dose radiation therapy for nonmalignant conditions in its spring 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.astro.org/getmedia/cdbdf346-2401-4dfc-9af1-2394e3562f59/2024-ASTROnews-Spring-(Digital).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;quarterly newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, its use began to pick up steam, Mehta said. Unlike radiation therapy for cancer, LDRT, as its name suggests, uses low doses to suppress inflammatory cells. Mehta said six LDRT treatments expose the patient to about the same amount of radiation as in one cancer treatment or what someone might get from “a few” CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KTQCA6QS4ZEIBNG5WKFHE2A7PU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Low-dose radiation treatments almost &lt;a href="https://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016%2822%2900357-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;date back&lt;/a&gt; to when X-rays were first discovered in 1895, Mehta said. They eventually fell out of favor in part due to new treatment options, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but also because of radiation fears, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MKC7NFUTO5DTROSKDXGFMSFHXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://virginiaradiation.com/our-team/gopal-k-bajaj-md-mba-fastro/" target="_blank"&gt;Gopal Bajaj&lt;/a&gt;, the musculoskeletal lead for the American Society for Radiation Oncology task force on non-oncologic disease, said LDRT remained popular in Europe. &lt;a href="https://www.degro.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The German Society for Radiation Oncology&lt;/a&gt; published &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10803052/" target="_blank"&gt;national guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for its use in nonmalignant diseases in 2000. In the United States, “it’s within the last decade or so that there’s been a slow reemergence of interest into exploring radiotherapy for conditions other than cancer,” Bajaj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJXU6LDBP5FZVI54TJB3VAWDF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Bajaj first encountered it as a therapy about a decade ago when an interested patient with &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/dupuytrens-contracture#:~:text=Dupuytren%20contracture%20is%20an%20abnormal,cases%2C%20both%20hands%20are%20affected." target="_blank"&gt;Dupuytren’s contracture&lt;/a&gt; — a condition that involves thickening of the skin on the palm of the hand, often causing fingers to curl under — asked for it. He started delving into the scientific literature, which was primarily German, and decided it was worth a try. It worked, halting the progression of her condition, which Bajaj said is the goal of the treatment. Since then, Bajaj has seen around 800 people with the disease who fly in from all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SOH5PYRLZJAPBOUD2IMSYQ4GHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Most patients we see with Dupuytren’s are actively progressing when they begin treatment, and after radiation therapy, fewer than 5 to 8 percent continue to worsen,” Bajaj said. When it comes to inflammatory conditions like osteoarthritis, tendinopathy or plantar fasciitis, Bajaj said, 60 to 80 percent of his patients report some symptom improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJI7TJZN7BEGTNQF73PJXOOVYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A Department of Veterans Affairs survey last year of &lt;a href="https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/publications/esp/Radiation-Benign-Conditions.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;48 studies&lt;/a&gt; on the effectiveness of LDRT for a variety of conditions, some several decades old, found mixed evidence to make conclusions about its effectiveness, but it said there was no reason not to try it “after conventional therapy fails.” Bajaj and Mehta said they believe the research is still catching up to what doctors are seeing in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="DDRUVSQS2RHPTHNIO7G6JQ6KLM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="DDRUVSQS2RHPTHNIO7G6JQ6KLM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6DQYZRC3MJFO3FOMZ7VNPONM74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whenever there’s trauma (from a surgery or an injury), macrophages, white blood cells that modulate inflammation, begin to secrete chemicals that promote inflammation. The X-rays suppress the macrophages, which “stops this inflammatory cascade from taking hold and, therefore, the pain and the swelling goes away,” Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2WZPGOHKJ5A5LORUQ2C3TSERGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;LDRT can work for injuries or conditions where there’s inflammation, Mehta said, such as tendinitis, osteoarthritis and plantar fasciitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7SODFR2XBJBMFG4DOFHXSGT2KY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some cases, LDRT seems to provide immediate relief, while others can take longer. In Mehta’s case, it took six to eight weeks before his Achilles felt better. A cortisone shot may work faster, he said, but judging from his and his patients’ experiences, the LDRT results seem to last longer. He said it may also be more beneficial to the long-term health of the joints because cortisone shots can weaken the tendon and the fibers of the connective tissue, which can up the risk for tendon ruptures with repeated injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HOQJPEUU5FINE4E5G5ORTV74M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There is a “sweet spot” for LDRT, Bajaj said. If a patient’s condition is too advanced, such as if their arthritis has led to a bone-on-bone (without cartilage or fluid to pad it) situation, or there’s an autoimmune component to it, such as with ankylosing spondylitis, it probably won’t work, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="2NO4MTWFXRDKHLVUW4GG4GVPHU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="2NO4MTWFXRDKHLVUW4GG4GVPHU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Downsides and risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U7FMCM5QFJEPXIT3MKO2KZISO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not all radiation specialists are on board with low-dose X-ray treatment for benign conditions. At Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, for instance, when &lt;a href="https://www.moffitt.org/providers/jose-penagaricano/" target="_blank"&gt;Jose Penagaricano&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist who has been treating patients with malignant conditions for six years, started treating osteoarthritis and Dupuytren contracture about a year ago, he got some pushback from colleagues worried that LDRT would take machine time away from ill cancer patients, he said. By limiting consultations for LDRT cases, though, he said the impact has been minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XNGW3T4KYNF63I2FU7VJ4ZWHTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The bigger concern that those using LDRT have heard from colleagues and patients is radiation exposure. Even low-dose exposure over a lifetime has the potential to cause a small increase in the risk of cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-health-effects#:~:text=These%20studies%20show%20that%20radiation,dose%2C%20the%20lower%20the%20risk." target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TCNHBZGRJZBXJGRWW4XUJDUSQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David Brenner, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.crr.columbia.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Radiological Research&lt;/a&gt; at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that, in general, the long-term health concerns related to radiation exposure are specific to organs that “have a lot of dividing cells,” such as the gastrointestinal system. Hands, feet and knees — frequent sites for LDRT — would be of less concern, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QAAY4MN45CYDERN7YZL6J4GJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A 2015 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4984935/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20evidence%20suggests%20that%20the%20risks,is%20being%20considered%20in%20adolescents%20or%20children" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the British Journal of Radiology suggests that the risks of cancer following low-dose radiation therapy for benign disease tend to be small, especially in older patients. But because “exposure to radiation has the potential to cause a radiation-induced cancer many years after treatment,” it may be an issue for younger adults, adolescents and children, the study said. Concerns about lifetime accumulation of radiation is why radiation doctors typically use this treatment only on patients over 40, Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="54BQCSA66REY3PU5UM3O6ICLQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The major thing people are worried about with radiation is radiation itself causing cancer, [but] it takes, even in higher-dose cancer patients, literally decades for a second cancer to develop,” he said. “With these low doses of radiation that we use for arthritis and tendinitis, there’s been nothing described in the literature for over a hundred years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:31:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNQmFWUDQ1QnhoTkpJd2lzRUpNSExTY1dROS05UktZeXp0WVFOYU1IUjBtaVZCWk0zaDNzTkdjM1c4M3Z3LUJSRmxzXzNuRU9xemQ4T3NIdVBTcXlMel92UGJMVGxFS0FJV3l6d1phdEdtcTFkNlRwcFd6cGZFeE1jR0RPbHBsUFY3aGgzcVl1ZTRrNGk2TEE</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 50岁后减肥的5个习惯- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPbkVHT1FEeDZDbUpnM0I0NkZ4VmpmQnB1cjJjYWliV0lsd3E1clpRVXViMmNYYjhxd0JQWWFqbWM1NURLd2FVOGVfNjlyTFpKSXFxT0ZGQk9qZktldEFPWi1DVHRUVWtNa0xwYmVIOVAzX2JvSDkyb2pXOEhaQUJGdnJuWEQ1bDg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After 50, our metabolisms naturally slow down, which can lead to weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This may be compounded by hormonal changes, difficulty sleeping and new medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RDs say the trick to weight loss after 50 is replacing old habits with newer, more effective ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Weight loss can feel like an uphill battle at any age. But if you’re over 50, you may have noticed it’s become a bit trickier. And it’s not just your imagination. "As we age, muscle mass naturally declines, which lowers your resting metabolic rate, meaning your body burns fewer calories at rest,” says &lt;a href="http://jamieleerdn.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, that’s not the only reason it’s harder to shed pounds after 50. Hormonal shifts, difficulty sleeping and new medications can also make weight loss more challenging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re all about cardio but rarely hit the weights, you’re missing out on a critical component of weight loss, especially later in life. “Prioritizing strength training can help preserve muscle, boost metabolism and support sustainable weight management after 50,” says &lt;a href="https://whitnessnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whitney Stuart, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Muscle is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;calorie-burning machine&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, as we age, muscle mass naturally declines. So, if you’re not actively working to rebuild or maintain it, your metabolism can slow down.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Strength training helps combat this by building muscle, which helps you burn more calories even when you’re not exercising.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, studies show that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;resistance exercises&lt;/a&gt; like lifting weights or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-body-weight-training-plan-for-beginners-11744140" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;bodyweight activities&lt;/a&gt; can help preserve and even increase muscle mass as we age, laying the foundation for a leaner and healthier body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, many of us may shy away from strength training, either out of fear of injury or simply because we haven’t heard how important it is. Or maybe you think you need a gym membership or just don’t know where to get started. No problem, says &lt;a href="http://nutritionstarringyou.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Simple body work like push ups, planks and squats are easily done at home with no equipment and will help to strengthen large muscle groups as well as build core strength,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-following-fad-diets"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Following Fad Diets  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fad diets often promise quick results. Yet, they rarely provide the sustainable solutions necessary for managing weight. While that can be an issue at any age, it can be especially problematic after 50 for several reasons. For starters, many trendy diets are restrictive, often cutting out entire food groups or dramatically reducing calories. While you may see the numbers on the scale dip temporarily, this approach can backfire by slowing your metabolism even further. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To complicate matters, many calorie-cutting diets are also low in protein. “Eating a low-protein, low-calorie diet specifically can backfire by further reducing muscle mass and slowing metabolism even more,” says Stuart. “Without enough protein, the body may break down muscle for energy, which makes it harder to maintain a healthy weight long term.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As tempting as it may seem to jump on the latest weight loss craze, skip it. You’ll have far greater success with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2053490/high-protein-flat-belly-diet-meal-plan/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced eating plan&lt;/a&gt; that includes plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-proteins-to-help-you-lose-weight-11770165" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lean protein&lt;/a&gt;, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-neglecting-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Neglecting Sleep  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep is often overlooked when it comes to weight loss, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; can silently hinder your efforts. The reason? After 50, sleep patterns can naturally become more erratic due to lifestyle changes, stress or hormonal shifts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t just cause sleepless nights and daytime drowsiness. Sleep deprivation also disrupts &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7917054/what-happen-to-your-hormones-when-you-lose-weight-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hunger-regulating hormones&lt;/a&gt; like leptin and ghrelin. This imbalance can lead to increased cravings, particularly for high-calorie foods. That’s not all. Research has also found that people who don’t get enough sleep tend to consume fewer fruits and vegetables, yet eat more fast food, fat and sugar, making them even more likely to gain weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It can be helpful to know that some age-related changes in sleep patterns are normal, such as going to sleep earlier at night and waking up earlier in the morning. However, sleep shouldn’t become so elusive that you can’t regularly get the seven to nine hours your body needs. If you’re having difficulty getting enough sleep, talk to your health care provider, who can help you determine the reason and find strategies to help you get the rest you need.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-sticking-with-the-same-eating-habits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Sticking with the Same Eating Habits &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With age, our energy needs naturally begin to decline. So, if you’re eating the same way you always have, you might start to gain weight, even if the foods you eat are healthy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Maybe you’ve always finished what’s on your plate or snacked while watching TV. While that might have worked just fine in the past, after age 50, these habits can start to work against you. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Mindless snacking, especially in the evening, can sabotage weight loss efforts,” says &lt;a href="http://drlisayoung.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa R. Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Many people eat out of boredom or habit while watching TV, often choosing calorie-dense foods without realizing how much they’re consuming. These extra, unaccounted-for calories can add up quickly.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that sounds familiar, take time to sit down at the table to eat without distractions. This will help you focus on enjoying your food and pay attention to your body’s hunger and fullness signals, which may help you eat less. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-forgetting-to-drink-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Forgetting to Drink Up  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hydration plays a key role in digestion, metabolism and overall satiety. Yet, as you age, your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8064290/how-to-tell-if-you-are-dehydrated/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sense of thirst diminishes&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, many older people don’t drink nearly enough fluids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This can make it harder to meet your hydration needs without conscious effort and may even lead to dehydration. In addition, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8023931/does-dehydration-cause-weight-gain/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dehydration can mimic hunger&lt;/a&gt;, prompting you to eat more at meals or snack more frequently.  Because dehydration can also slow your body’s metabolic processes, it can make it harder to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290811/can-losing-weight-slow-your-metabolism/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;burn calories efficiently&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fix? Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. For even better weight loss results, try to drink a big glass of water before meals. This simple, effective strategy may help you feel full faster and prevent overeating.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Losing weight after 50 can seem tricky, but it doesn’t have to be. The key lies in identifying old habits that work against your goals and replacing them with newer, more effective ones that work for your body today. By incorporating habits like regular strength training, eating a balanced diet, prioritizing sleep, being mindful of portion sizes and drinking enough fluids, you can overcome many of the weight loss challenges that naturally come with aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that sounds like a lot, remember, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-i-lost-110-pounds-8773037" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;small, sustainable changes&lt;/a&gt; build up over time. Stay patient and be kind to yourself through the process. And, most importantly, focus on feeling strong, healthy and energetic. Because being your healthiest, best self isn’t just about the number on the scale.&lt;br&gt;

He had enjoyed hiking, running the St. George Marathon — he ran it 25 years in a row — traveling the world with his wife, Mindy, climbing mountains, just living an active lifestyle. From what he knew at the time, he could never do these things again with Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time went on, the 67-year-old Logan resident began to deteriorate. The tremors and rigidity transformed the man who ran ultramarathons into one who could barely walk across his living room without holding on to something. And when his &lt;a href="https://www.webbmortuary.com/obituaries/mindy-lundgreen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wife died from ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, Lundgreen wondered how he'd even go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he figured it out: He'd try to move his body the way he used to on adventures with Mindy. And like his late wife, he would encourage other people to move, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I heard the doctor, I thought, oh, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Parkinson's," he said. "But just moving has made me feel better, and inspiring other people to move has made this whole diagnosis into a gift. I want to live until I'm 90 years old! And I have the special formula to make that happen: move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundgreen discovered it is one thing to want to move and a whole other thing to actually do it, but a recent trip to the Grand Tetons opened his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I went to visit him — I hadn't seen him in a while — and I saw him and thought: Wow. He was having a hard time walking across a room," said David Toone, Lundgreen's friend and "soul brother," who is 68. "So, I said to him, 'Do you want to come climb Middle Teton?' And he actually showed up to do it. That really opened my eyes. He was still frail, but he was going to give it a go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundgreen had to accept that walking around the block or across a parking lot was going to be harder than he thought possible. He also had to accept that he would not walk or run as fast as he had before. He still had Parkinson's, meaning he would be in pain when he moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a challenging climb for Lundgreen, as well as for Toone and others on the trip. They helped Lundgreen up and down the climbing paths, which added to their hiking time and difficulty level, but Toone said getting his longtime friend moving again was worth the time it took to complete the climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Lundgreen remembered what it was like when he began running marathons and hiking decades before — once he started, he felt better and couldn't stop. He also couldn't stop talking to people about the importance of moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;I feel better now than when I was diagnosed.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Kim Lundgreen, who has Parkinson's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He attended a boxing class in Logan and encouraged people to take the stairs instead of using the elevator. Lundgreen registered for a 5K race and, later, a trail marathon, hoping others could see how important movement is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundgreen is not one to preach on social media, but he does like to spread his movement message through a conversation, because a conversation allows people to ask questions and share new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His message is clear: You don't have to run marathons — but you can do something. And once you start doing something, that's when you start to dream of a happy future with Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes in his life and his return to physical activity have brought attention from people all over the world. A Parkinson's patient in Australia contacted him to discuss how he returned to running. Many others from across the globe have asked the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the big surprise was when &lt;a href="https://ultramarathonman.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Karnazes&lt;/a&gt;, an American ultramarathon runner, contacted him to offer his support and to wish him well on his continued running journey. Karnazes, who is famous for running 50 marathons in the 50 states in 50 days, as well as running 148 miles on a treadmill in 24 hours, suggested that the two of them go for a run together the next time Karnazes is in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this attention — even from someone as massive to a runner as Karnazes — has not swayed Lundgreen from his goals. His biggest bucket-list item is to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, and he plans to return to Salzburg, Austria, where he and his late wife once took a "Sound of Music" tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Lundgreen hopes to be alive to see what science will come up with for people with &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2024/09/parkinsons-disease-understanding-complex-neurodegenerative-disorder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to be alive when they come up with a cure for Parkinson's," he said. "I'm telling you, I feel better now than when I was diagnosed. The 5K race was like breaking through a brick wall. As long as I'm moving, I feel great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s all fun and games until you realize you’re accidentally surrounded by hundreds of flying, disease-carrying animals. &lt;strong&gt;Tulum&lt;/strong&gt; is known for its turquoise waters, great food, and unique cenotes (underground caves and sinkholes). Once a hidden gem, this beach is now a tourism magnet. But as this viral incident shows, those &lt;strong&gt;Instagram-worthy cenotes&lt;/strong&gt; can come with some &lt;strong&gt;serious health risks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a viral video with more than 9.1 million views, content creator Kristin Newby (@kristin__newby) shared the wild discovery she had in the middle of what she thought was a peaceful swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video, Newby is chilling in a cenote with her friend when suddenly they look up and see hundreds of eyes staring back at them.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s apparent that she and her friend were taken aback by what they were seeing. But they seemed not to try to panic to avoid further disturbing the bats, lest they come flying down at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe we should of got a rabies shot,” Newby said in the caption. Given that she’s kept posting, it seems Newby is fine and hasn’t contracted any kind of deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Swimmers Beware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the follow-up, Newby added that they “had no idea they were up there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also added the following in a comment: “Over a million people visit Tulum cenotes a year, and hundreds of travelers and locals go there every single day. These bats are used to people and there were tons of locals around us. The local tour guide splashed them. Not us. The bats weren’t harmed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newby told BroBible that their tour guide was a random guy who owned a bar they visited. He took them on an adventure to a lazy river, cenotes, and a cleansing Mayan ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the cenote he told me and my friends to come into the cave to take a picture, when we finally got into the cave where you see in the video, he told us to come closer, we had no idea what was above us at the time, he had the flash light on with a video and acted like he was going to take a pic and then panned the camera up to the ceiling and we all freaked out lol,” she shared via Instagram direct message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is Rabies?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a deadly virus that spreads to humans through the saliva of infected animals, usually via bites, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., you’re most likely to encounter rabies from bats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, and skunks. But if you’re traveling to developing countries, stray dogs are your biggest concern. The virus can also spread through infected saliva getting into open wounds or mucous membranes like your mouth or eyes, though that’s much rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any mammal can carry and transmit rabies, from your neighbor’s cat to wild beavers. Even pets like dogs, cats, ferrets, goats, and horses can spread it if they’re infected. In extremely rare cases, people have even contracted rabies from infected organ transplants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Happens If You Get Rabies?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things get genuinely scary. Once rabies symptoms start showing up, the disease is almost always fatal, per the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why immediate &lt;a href="https://brobible.com/culture/article/woman-bat-mouth-medical-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;medical attention after any potential exposure&lt;/a&gt; is absolutely crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early symptoms are deceptively mild—basically flu-like stuff that can last for days. You might experience fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. But as the virus progresses, things get much worse fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later-stage symptoms include agitation, anxiety, confusion, hyperactivity, and difficulty swallowing. Patients often develop excessive salivation and experience fear when trying to drink fluids because swallowing becomes so difficult. Even having air blown on their face can trigger fear responses. The virus can also cause hallucinations, insomnia, and partial paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic emphasizes that if you’re bitten by any animal—or even think you might have been exposed to a rabid animal—you need to seek medical care immediately. This includes situations where you wake up to find a bat in your room, since these creatures can bite without waking you up. When in doubt, assume exposure happened and get checked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commenters React&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would’ve been screaming and crying. Might’ve even drowned,” a top comment read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Went from becoming mermaids to vampires real quick,” a person said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mind yall, yall in their house,” another pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BroBible reached out to Newby for comment via email and Instagram direct message.&lt;/p&gt;

Women may misattribute these symptoms to PMS, work stress, or family issues, but unmanaged blood sugar could be to blame.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee may reduce the absorption of iron, calcium, magnesium and some vitamins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait at least 1 hour after coffee to take supplements for better nutrient uptake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not everyone needs supplements—talk to your provider before adding them to your routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re the kind of person who can’t start their day without a cup (or two) of coffee, you’re not alone. Coffee is a staple morning ritual—whether it’s sipped alongside breakfast, before a workout or first thing after waking up, that morning brew helps us feel energized and ready for the day. But if you also take vitamins or minerals as part of your morning routine, it’s worth knowing how coffee might influence how your body absorbs those nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine, polyphenols and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-coffee-dehydrating-8781369" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;coffee’s mild diuretic effect&lt;/a&gt; can interfere with how your body uses certain vitamins and minerals. "For instance, iron absorption can be slowed by caffeine and caffeine can impact certain nutrients via its diuretic properties," says Philip Ngo, Pharm.D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We spoke with pharmacists to understand how coffee can impact nutrient absorption—and what you can do to get the most from your supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-iron"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Iron  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-iron-8733430" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is essential for growth, hormone production and cellular function. And it’s a common nutrient deficiency, so your healthcare provider may have suggested supplementing.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Having coffee with an iron supplement or fortified cereal may make your body absorb less iron," notes Bo Wang, M.D., Pharm.D. "Over time, a heavy caffeine habit could potentially impact bone and mineral health." One study found that drinking coffee with iron reduced absorption by 54%. Pairing it with breakfast further lowered absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This interaction isn’t about the caffeine—it’s due to chlorogenic acid, a polyphenol in coffee and tea. "This compound is a strong inhibitor of non-heme iron absorption (the type found in plant foods and supplements)," adds Elise Kim, Pharm.D., BCACP, CDCES, AHSCP-CHC. Researchers believe that the polyphenols may impact the way our gut absorbs iron. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Wang recommends separating iron from coffee by at least one hour and pairing it with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as lemons and oranges, to enhance absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is a nutrient that is hard to get through diet alone, since it’s not naturally found in many foods. However, our bodies can also make vitamin D from sunshine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"Research suggests that caffeine may reduce the expression of vitamin D receptors, which can lower vitamin D levels," says Kim. "However, its clinical impact is still being studied." A 2021 study linked higher caffeine intake with lower circulating levels of vitamin D, though more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To get the most from your supplement, consider spacing it at least an hour away from your coffee, Ngo suggests. And since vitamin D is fat-soluble, taking it with a meal that includes healthy fats can help improve absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-b-vitamins"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. B Vitamins  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;group of water-soluble vitamins&lt;/a&gt;—including B1, B2, B7, B9 and B12—supports energy production, nerve function and red blood cell formation. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water, and our bodies cannot store a lot of excess at one time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "As B vitamins are water-soluble, caffeine’s mild diuretic effect can increase how much your body excretes, especially with higher caffeine intake," says Kim. Studies show that people who drink coffee tend to have lower levels of circulating B vitamins, likely due to urinary losses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Avoid taking supplements with coffee or tea," advises Wang. "Wait an hour if you can. Water-soluble vitamins (C, Bs) are fine with or without food, but may go down easier after a meal."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is an important mineral that plays a role in protein synthesis, blood sugar management, blood pressure regulation and sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it’s found in foods like beans, nuts and yogurt, many people don’t get enough from diet alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Caffeine can increase calcium and magnesium loss through urine," notes Kim.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re taking magnesium as part of a nighttime routine—a common supplement to help you sleep better—it’s best to avoid caffeine close to bedtime. Not only can caffeine interfere with sleep, but it may also reduce magnesium’s effectiveness in promoting deeper rest.

"Calcium absorption may be reduced by caffeine, but the clinical impact remains unclear," says Kim. A study showed that participants who consumed caffeine had 77% more calcium excreted by their kidneys compared to a placebo group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee can influence how your body absorbs certain nutrients, but simple timing tweaks can help. Spacing out your supplements from coffee by an hour can support better absorption. If you occasionally forget and take them together, you’ll still likely absorb some nutrients.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And in spite of what you may see being pushed by wellness influencers, not everyone needs supplements. "Supplements are just that—to supplement," says Ngo. "For a person in good general health who consumes a balanced diet, it may not be worth investing in supplements unless you are truly deficient." Chatting with a health care provider and lab testing can help determine what’s best for you.&lt;br&gt;

The study found that men were more likely to empathize with their partner, identify the situation as discriminatory, and express greater overall awareness of sexism and commitment to gender equality when they actively took their partner’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Emily J. Cross of York University in Canada, sheds light on how romantic relationships might serve as a unique environment for fostering men’s awareness of gender discrimination. While traditional efforts to reduce sexism often fall short, especially when targeting men, this study suggests that hearing directly from a romantic partner about sexism may be a promising avenue for increasing understanding and reducing gender-biased attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in whether romantic relationships could serve as a meaningful context for raising men’s awareness of sexism. Research shows that men, on average, are less likely than women to &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1111/josi.12083" target="_blank"&gt;recognize gender discrimination&lt;/a&gt; or understand its impact—perhaps because conversations about sexism can feel accusatory, prompting defensiveness or disengagement,” explained Cross, a senior research associate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/spc3.12116" target="_blank"&gt;perspective-taking&lt;/a&gt;—imagining how an experience might feel from someone else’s point of view—has been shown to reduce intergroup prejudice and discrimination. We figured romantic relationships might offer a unique opportunity: partners are often attuned to each other’s emotions, and what affects one usually matters to the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That kind of closeness could give men a powerful reason to better understand what their partner is going through. So we asked: could that intimacy motivate men to take their partner’s perspective—and in doing so, help them recognize sexism not as isolated moments, but as part of a broader pattern of gender-based inequality?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the researchers conducted two studies with heterosexual men who had been in romantic relationships with women for at least a year. In the first study, 576 participants recruited online were randomly assigned to read a scenario about gender discrimination in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman in the scenario was described as either the man’s romantic partner, a close friend, or a stranger. All participants read that the woman had learned that a male colleague with similar qualifications was earning 25% more than her. She suspected the pay gap was due to her being a woman and expressed frustration and uncertainty about what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reading the scenario, participants were asked how much they could put themselves in the woman’s shoes, how sexist they perceived the situation to be, and how aware they were of sexism more generally. They also completed surveys measuring their broader attitudes about gender, including modern sexist beliefs (such as denying that sexism still exists) and protective paternalism (the belief that men should shield and provide for women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that men were more likely to engage in perspective-taking when the woman in the scenario was described as their romantic partner. Men in this condition also rated the situation as more sexist compared to those who read about a friend or a stranger. These effects remained even when accounting for participants’ general levels of empathy, relationship quality, and existing sexist beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, simply imagining a partner experiencing sexism did not directly lead to broader changes in gender attitudes or increased awareness of discrimination against women in general. But when researchers analyzed indirect pathways, they found that perspective-taking increased the likelihood of perceiving the situation as sexist, which in turn predicted greater general awareness and lower modern sexism scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study was designed to test whether similar patterns emerged when men recalled real experiences with their partners rather than imagined scenarios. The researchers surveyed 570 men, of whom 432 reported that their romantic partner had previously shared a personal experience of gender discrimination. These included examples like being passed over for a promotion, receiving unwanted sexual attention, or hearing sexist jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to describe the incident and then answer questions about how much they took their partner’s perspective, whether they viewed the situation as discriminatory, and how aware they were of sexism in society. They also answered questions about how often they believed their partner experienced discrimination and whether they had taken actions to support gender equality—such as learning more about women’s issues or confronting sexism when they witnessed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As predicted, men who reported greater perspective-taking during their partner’s disclosure were more likely to view the situation as sexist. This recognition was, in turn, associated with greater awareness of how often women—and their partner specifically—experience discrimination. It also predicted higher levels of allyship behaviors, including a stronger commitment to confronting gender bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these effects held even when controlling for participants’ existing beliefs about gender roles and other factors. This suggests that the relational context itself plays a powerful role in shaping how men respond to discussions about sexism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were struck by how consistent the perspective-taking effect was,” Cross told PsyPost. “These effects emerged regardless of how close men felt to their partner, how satisfied they were in the relationship, or their pre-existing views on gender equality. What really made the difference was the act of taking their partner’s perspective—actively imagining how the situation felt for her when she described an experience of sexism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how romantic relationships can create opportunities for men to become more aware of sexism by prompting them to empathize with someone they care deeply about. When men are personally connected to someone affected by discrimination, they may be more open to recognizing it and questioning their own assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Men were more likely to recognize sexism when it affected their women romantic partner (vs woman friend or stranger),” Cross said. “This recognition also spilled over to their broader beliefs — men were more aware of gender discrimination in general and were less likely to agree with subtle, everyday beliefs that downplay or dismiss sexism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, includes some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our studies specifically focused on man–woman relationships, so we didn’t test whether the same dynamics would apply in other types of relationships,” Cross noted. “And while perspective-taking can be a powerful tool for building awareness, it’s not enough on its own—lasting progress requires systemic changes and collective efforts to challenge gender inequality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest future studies could examine how similar dynamics play out in other close relationships, such as between siblings or parents and children, and whether interventions like high-quality listening training might help men better engage with stories of discrimination. Longitudinal research could also help clarify whether perspective-taking leads to increased awareness over time, or whether more awareness makes men more likely to empathize in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re interested in exploring how men respond to a broader range of disclosures from women—ranging from subtle forms of sexism to more overt discrimination—and what kinds of partner responses women actually want and find supportive,” Cross said. “We’re also studying how these conversations play out in real time, including what fosters meaningful engagement versus what triggers defensiveness or withdrawal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key takeaway is that man–woman romantic relationships can provide a powerful context for raising men’s awareness of sexism and gender discrimination,” she added. “When men are willing to listen and genuinely engage with their partner’s experiences, they may begin to see sexism not just as a distant or abstract issue, but as something that affects the women they care about—and recognize it as part of a broader, structural problem that demands attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506251345111" target="_blank"&gt;Leveraging Man−Woman Romantic Relationships to Promote Men’s Awareness of Sexism and Gender Discrimination&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Emily.

					&lt;p&gt;Belly fat always seems to creep up when you least expect it to. As you age, experiencing a redistribution in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/simple-daily-exercises-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;body fat&lt;/a&gt; is quite common. Where does it tend to gravitate? The abdomen. Hormonal shifts and the natural loss of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-exercises-build-muscle-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;lean muscle&lt;/a&gt; are partly to blame. But there are several things you can do to take charge of your health and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-moves-belly-fat-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;reclaim your waistline&lt;/a&gt;. First off, if you’ve only been doing cardio, it’s time to tweak your workout regimen. We spoke with a trainer who shares five bodyweight &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/core-strengthening-exercises/" target="_blank"&gt;core exercises&lt;/a&gt; that burn belly fat faster than cardio after 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that you can’t spot-reduce fat. What you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do is build lean muscle, which &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://thebracelife.com/bookings-old/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert Brace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, celebrity trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://bracelifestudios.com/about" target="_blank"&gt;Brace Life Studios&lt;/a&gt;, says is “your metabolism’s best friend.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“Increasing your lean muscle mass will increase your metabolism, which is the process through which your body processes energy,” Robert explains. “Energy is often stored as fat in your body so increasing your lean muscle mass is a great way to burn body fat all over your body. Especially after 40, when hormonal shifts slow fat burning, building lean muscle whether it’s through weight training or bodyweight resistance can dramatically improve your body’s ability to burn fat even at rest. That’s been the key to many of our clients’ waistline transformations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, Robert shares five go-to bodyweight core exercises perfect for those 40+ who want to burn fat and sculpt strong abs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Begin standing tall, feet shoulder-width apart and hands by your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your knees as you lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When rising up, drive your left knee up toward your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist your torso toward your raised knee.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We consulted with dietitians who shared valuable insights into &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906041/things-you-should-do-before-8-am-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;optimizing morning routines&lt;/a&gt; for brain health and practical tips to boot!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7913071/high-protein-high-fiber-breakfast-recipes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-dense breakfast&lt;/a&gt; sets the tone for overall health, and eggs are a stand-out option. “Exciting new data suggests an association between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960178/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-eggs-every-day/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating eggs&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-dementia-study-11748383" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduced risk of Alzheimer’s dementia&lt;/a&gt; in older adults,” shares &lt;a href="https://minddietmeals.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Research has shown that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;nutrients in eggs&lt;/a&gt; like choline, the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, and lutein help support lifelong brain health,” adds Moon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon adds that although choline is crucial for brain health, 90% of Americans don’t get enough of this nutrient.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating two eggs provides 50-70% of your daily choline requirement.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Working eggs into your morning is easy—enjoy them scrambled, boiled, or as part of an omelet packed with veggies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-have-a-morning-cup-of-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Have a Morning Cup Of Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, you read that right—your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/women-aging-coffee-study-11748151" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;morning cup of joe&lt;/a&gt; may be doing more than waking you up. Research found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-surprising-drink-could-reduce-heart-disease-risk-11692285" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;moderate coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt;, around 1 to 4 cups a day, could help lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It turns out that coffee’s natural blend of antioxidants, along with the stimulating effects of caffeine, plays a role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting brain health&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s particularly exciting is how simple this habit is to adopt. Imagine starting your day with a comforting cup of coffee, knowing you’re not just fueling your morning but potentially protecting your brain for the long run. Experts emphasize that moderation is key, as excessive caffeine might have downsides. And make sure to limit (or even avoid) any added sugars when prepping your morning drink—excessive added sugar consumption can actually hurt, not help, your brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Giving your brain a “workout” is just as important as starting your day with physical movement. “Word games support cognitive function by stimulating recall, memory, language and problem-solving skills that support brain health,” explains &lt;a href="https://nutritiondigested.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Brownstein, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Incorporate word games like crossword puzzles or spelling bees into your breakfast routine to help keep your mind sharp,” Brownstein advised.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try setting aside just 10 or 15 minutes each morning to enjoy the crossword puzzle over your coffee or while eating breakfast. It’s a small commitment that could have long-term benefits. And if you’re looking for variety, you can swap out the crossword for Sudoku, word searches, or even a quick brain-training app. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-take-a-morning-walk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Take a Morning Walk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moving your body in the morning can work wonders for your brain. “Walking boosts blood flow to the brain, which helps deliver oxygen and nutrients that support brain health,” explained &lt;a href="https://nutritionwithjuliana.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Juliana Crimi, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.h.sc" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;M.H.Sc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionwithjuliana.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;., RD,&lt;/a&gt;. “Regular &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; has been linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-for-better-memory-11781473" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;better memory&lt;/a&gt;,  thinking, and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; over time,” Crimi explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bonus? Walking stimulates the release of endorphins, putting you in a positive mindset to face the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Aim for at least 20 to 30 minutes each morning at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Whether you stroll through your neighborhood, a local park, or simply around your backyard, the combined effects of movement, fresh air, and sunlight &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291942/exactly-how-much-nature-time-you-need-to-reap-the-physical-and-mental-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;enhance both physical and mental health&lt;/a&gt;.

Regular meditation supports memory and focus by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-when-you-wake-up-if-you-have-chronic-inflammation-8789044" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing stress and inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, two factors associated with cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Setting aside just 5 to 10 minutes in the morning to meditate creates a calming start to your day while enhancing your brain’s ability to manage emotional and cognitive tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can start with basic mindfulness meditation, focusing on your breath and letting go of distractions. Over time, you may find that taking even a small pause each morning helps you feel more grounded and promotes a lasting sense of mental clarity. Use a meditation app or simply create a quiet space in your home to integrate this powerful practice into your routine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Social connections are key to longevity and brain health. Research consistently shows that maintaining an active social life can help stave off Alzheimer’s by keeping your brain engaged and reducing the risks associated with isolation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Starting your morning with a brief call or text to a close friend or family member can provide a small boost of happiness and connectedness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These interactions don’t have to be lengthy! Just a friendly hello or check-in is enough to start your day on a positive note. If distance or busyness is a barrier, consider making it a weekly ritual with one or several loved ones. Sharing a laugh or a conversation can do wonders for your mental well-being, while also supporting healthy communication networks in your brain.

From the foods you eat to the activities you prioritize, the morning provides a unique opportunity to start your day with intention. Whether it’s enjoying eggs at breakfast, stimulating your brain with a puzzle, or recharging through a walk or meditation, these small steps add up over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree that while no single habit can guarantee prevention, consistent efforts to incorporate healthy practices into your daily life can make a meaningful impact. The key is to find a routine that resonates with you; start small, stay consistent, and prioritize your health one morning at a time.&lt;br&gt;

Leaks are typically caused by injuries or trauma, but in rare cases can occur spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such leaks are rare, affecting about 1 in 20,000 people per year in the U.S., according to The Spinal CSF Leak Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts asked Badger to review her second MRI, taken in 2020. The imaging showed clear signs of “brain sag,” a condition where the brain begins to “sag” into the top of the spinal cord because there’s not enough cerebrospinal fluid to prop it up and hold it in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-houstonchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain sag was virtually imperceptible in the MRI taken three years earlier, so it’s likely that Roberts’ condition worsened to the point it could be seen, Badger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In her case, [the brain sag] was very apparent,” he said. “I think that’s why she had such severe cognitive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what caused Roberts’ leak, but patients are sometimes predisposed to them if they have underlying connective tissue disorders, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Roberts and her family were ecstatic to finally have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were so excited, because I was going to get my life back,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2 class="cci_subhead" title="CCI Subhead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinpointing the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging confirmed Roberts had a CSF leak, but doctors still needed to find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Badger injected contrast dye into Roberts’ spinal canal, then used medical imaging to see how it flowed through her body. The technique, called a dynamic myelogram, helps to visualize the spinal cord and nearby nerves and soft tissue, and pinpoint the location of a leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myelogram revealed a leak on the right side of Roberts’ thoracic spine, near the midpoint of her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Houston Methodist team initially tried to fix Roberts’ leak with an epidural blood patch, which involved injecting her own blood into the area around the spinal cord to seal it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="embed" data-server-side-rendered="true" class="e1ogmilg x100 f fdc aic mb32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Roberts had a type of leak known as a CSF venous fistula, an abnormal connection where a blood vessel and the space around the spine where the cerebrospinal fluid is stored. That type of leak is even trickier to diagnose and cannot be fixed with a blood patch, said Dr. Insun Chong, a neuroradiologist at Houston Methodist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter how much blood you inject, you’re still going to have that abnormal blood vessel there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2021, Roberts opted for a surgery that involved cutting into her back and using surgical clips to seal the leak. At that time, there were no hospitals in Texas that offered the procedure. It took four months to schedule a trip to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery kept Roberts hospitalized for a week, but she noticed a “night-and-day” difference afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I could recall things. I could function,” she said. “Everything was just like it was before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2 class="cci_subhead" title="CCI Subhead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A simpler solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fix turned out to be temporary, though. Roberts’ headaches and memory loss returned by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Houston Methodist neurosurgeon confirmed another leak, but offered Roberts an alternative to another trip to California. He suggested a novel, minimally-invasive procedure that involved inserting a catheter into Roberts’ groin to seal the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgeon, Dr. Kurt Yaeger, had never attempted the procedure, known as endoscopic embolization. But Roberts trusted him to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaeger had used the technique to treat other problems, such as brain aneurysms and vascular malformations. But Roberts was his first patient with a CSF leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was game to try it, and I very much appreciate her for that,” Yaeger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaeger began by inserting a catheter in a large blood vessel in her leg. He then moved the catheter to smaller blood vessels until he reached the leak in her spine. He then patched it with a substance that functions like super glue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts went home the day of the surgery, which has benefited her just as much as the more intensive procedure, her husband said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was pretty much like plugging a flat tire,” Rick Roberts said. “She’s back to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2 class="cci_subhead" title="CCI Subhead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pioneering a treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating Roberts helped the Houston Methodist team recognize they could fill a void by using the minimally invasive procedure to treat more CSF leak patients. Yaeger, Chong and neurosurgeons Dr. Alex Hoang and Dr. Meng Huang have spearheaded the effort and are now treating multiple patients each week, mostly from Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houston Methodist is the only hospital in Texas that offers treatment for the condition, according to the Spinal CSF Leak Foundation. The nonprofit also lists just one CSF leak practice apiece in Alabama, Arizona and Oklahoma, and none in 29 states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scarcity is partly because the condition has long been underdiagnosed, Chong said. He believes that may be due in part to the fact that about two-thirds of leaks are diagnosed in women; studies have found that doctors are more likely to dismiss women who complain of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not even a lot of people in the medical community know that this disease exists,” he said. “But it can be incredibly, incredibly debilitating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaeger is hopeful the condition will become more recognized over time, and that more hospitals will offer treatment for the condition. He also believes the minimally invasive approach should become the standard of practice because of its benefit to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very straightforward,” he said. “And once you do a couple procedures, it becomes more intuitive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts also hopes stories like hers will bring more attention to CSF leaks. She believes there are others with undiagnosed leaks who are suffering like she was, and who could be cured by a diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes me very emotional, because I know how sick I was and how bad things were," she said. “Now I can enjoy my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Houston Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 11:14:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPU2o5QW5sNWV5RmZ2VlBKTGJRZkpYRU1kRXZVTTMxVk5vdHFhU1BxVENoQ1hxWWlpZk9CUElERkd0ZGF4clA4Zmc3WWF1RjBCTVdRclE4eFEyaXJzNlhOcnEzUWtJVXF6UTF6WExDYWx6RDkyZHpqMjh4aklQbklxcUZBUEVfbUJiaGhIN2oyY3VQSEtWLW51MlpEazctczdIWWc</guid></item><item><title>根据医生的说法，为什么随着年龄的增长，你应该（可能）少喝酒-旧金山纪事报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPOHJWWEVXMVpqcVFxQTZZbmVNc1Zxdks0Q0w1WC1DVlZLRmRCSm9YcmcwZGEzMHlUQzlUUmVkd05QdTVMNHlqd2htRGptMy11YXdiMkc5MTZPSE5yZlFkeVhqZ0RhbFdpcEN4TDliXzhGcmdxOU1qM0MwWkswTUgtLWxlY3BGdUpTQUdHMFd4bmZtdWptUS1QY2oxOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

However, a mosquito sample 3.5 weeks ago tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Finding the first positive birds is always significant because it serves as an early warning sign for West Nile virus activity," Gary Goodman, the district manager, said in a statement. "It confirms the virus is present in our region, helps us identify areas where infected mosquitoes may be found, and provides insight into where human cases could emerge later in the season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is West Nile virus important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although West Nile virus has been in the United States since at least 1999, when it was discovered in New York, recent reports signal that it's showing up earlier in the season. Such is the case in Massachusetts, which recently discovered its first West Nile-carrying mosquitoes for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many scientists attribute this shift to a warming planet, which enables disease-spreading mosquitoes to stay active for longer periods throughout the year. Plus, these bloodsuckers are beginning to expand their ranges and move into higher altitudes. For instance, Connecticut officials are warning residents that a type of mosquito that can carry chikungunya, Zika, and dengue is expected to spread farther and faster across the state in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms of West Nile include fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. However, the virus sometimes turns deadly. In 2024, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/historic-data.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:164;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;164&lt;/a&gt; deaths attributed to West Nile. The Bee reported that a man in the San Joaquin Valley, which borders Sacramento County, died partly because of the virus, making it the first West Nile-related death in the state this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about West Nile?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the Bee, area officials are spraying insecticide to limit the spread of West Nile, and the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District is amping up its efforts to monitor and trap mosquitoes. The district also directs citizens to its &lt;a href="https://www.fightthebite.net" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which has updates and mosquito bite prevention tips, including draining standing water that can attract mosquitoes and avoiding spending time outdoors at dawn and dusk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, communities across the globe are looking for ways to reduce their mosquito populations to protect residents from illnesses such as West Nile. For example, one Florida county is using X-rays to kill invasive mosquitoes. And one neighborhood in the Philippines is paying residents to bring in any mosquitoes they can capture, dead or alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?recjqV5UFJqWpkEeZ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 10:30:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPcTdHQVdTVEY0WEpvVmdCVzM4T3J2ODY1WC1XbDl5S2dQVVNpX1JLRm9OcmU1THhETk12Rl9adEgyM2ZhTFQ1OTlkdzNYSkNPMWIyR3l6Y1BnTTVPMk5BQWhiZi1wY2lnOGhXLW85WnNrV2Y1N3BTZ1pFS1ZDTUdZR2UySThuNHd3Y1FLRUc3ZGg2T0k</guid></item><item><title>低收入者在社交互动中表现出更大的生理调节- PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQTFBoS3ZaWWJBNE5rMjdsM1J5cE45c3M0bDBYS012Y3hFRWJrcll4VEViT0xvdXlhSmdJUnBIWGFSTlk3T2NTM0dFUllWdEZIVERDak1HRWFaLXJ6Q1FTcXA5NGlsQVRRSjktRXlBcHdySk5kRjd5LV8zc1RZVnlaQWQ5S3VsTmNMYVV5X1pQZVd4c3JzTGxORUVrbHVsREhLSURGOWp5ak1JN0R6ZWV3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may be more tuned in to others during social encounters, even with strangers from different economic classes. According to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251350970" target="_blank"&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, individuals with lower socioeconomic status showed greater physiological attunement to their interaction partners than wealthier individuals did—regardless of the partner’s status. This greater sensitivity was also linked to more visible signs of comfort in those interacting with lower-income individuals. However, despite these dynamics, participants still reported liking people from similar class backgrounds more than those from different ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic status refers to a person’s social and economic standing in society. It typically includes a combination of income, education, occupation, and subjective assessments of status within one’s community or the broader society. People from higher socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have more access to resources and often face fewer threats to their social identity or opportunities. In contrast, lower-status individuals may experience more social obstacles, which can lead them to become more sensitive to their surroundings and others’ behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prior research has explored how class shapes values, perceptions, and behavior, there has been little investigation into what actually happens during interactions between people from different economic backgrounds. The research team wanted to understand whether class shapes how socially attuned people are to one another, especially when they are meeting for the first time. They also wanted to test whether people from different backgrounds behave differently or are perceived differently in conversation, and whether people show more affinity for others who share their socioeconomic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around the world, growing social class divisions are raising real concerns about social cohesion,” said study author &lt;a href="https://socsc.smu.edu.sg/faculty/profile/6821/Jacinth-TAN" target="_blank"&gt;Jacinth J. X. Tan&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of psychology at the Singapore Management University, School of Social Sciences and head of the &lt;a href="https://jacinthjxtan.wixsite.com/smushlab" target="_blank"&gt;SMU Social Health Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One common solution proposed by researchers and policymakers is to encourage more social mixing–or interaction between people from different social backgrounds. The hope is that greater mixing can build understanding and bridge divide. In fact, we are seeing greater calls for and efforts toward increasing diversity in higher education settings, workplaces and in communities, to foster greater mixing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, psychological research over the years has shown that contact between different groups is a double-edged sword: it can bring people together, but it can also highlight differences and create discomfort,” Tan explained. “In fact, recent studies have found that people often engage in fewer cross-class interactions than we might expect (&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/pspa0000302" target="_blank"&gt;Carey et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;). When they do, they tend to feel less connected (&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/xge0000258" target="_blank"&gt;Côté et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;), and those who see themselves as lower in social class are especially hesitant to interact across class lines (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672251316690" target="_blank"&gt;Wu et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That led us to wonder how people might respond if we created a more relaxed, even enjoyable, one-on-one interaction, where people are subtly aware of each other’s social class? Would this foster a more positive experience that may override the natural preference for interacting with people from a similar background?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine these questions, the researchers recruited 264 adults from the San Francisco Bay Area and paired them into 130 same- or different-class dyads—each consisting of two strangers matched by age, gender, and race. Socioeconomic status was determined using a multidimensional index that combined income, education, subjective status, and parents’ education. Participants were then grouped into pairs that were either similar in status or distinctly different (with more than 1.5 standard deviations separating them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pair went through a series of structured tasks in a laboratory setting. These included casual conversations, a cooperative word game, and a public-speaking task judged by a neutral observer. Throughout the interaction, participants’ cardiovascular responses were monitored to assess changes in sympathetic nervous system activity—a signal of emotional and physiological arousal. Specifically, researchers measured “pre-ejection period,” a time-based indicator of heart activity that reflects how strongly the heart is contracting under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physiological attunement was calculated by looking at how closely one participant’s physiological responses tracked with their partner’s responses over time. Behavioral cues, such as speaking clearly or fidgeting, were also recorded and analyzed by trained coders. After each task, participants completed surveys rating how much they liked their partner and how similar they felt to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most consistent finding across physiological, behavioral, and self-report measures was that people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were more responsive to their partners. Their physiological responses were more closely linked to those of their partner, suggesting they were paying more attention to how their partner was feeling or reacting. This was true regardless of whether they were paired with someone of similar or different status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, participants in general appeared more relaxed and at ease when paired with a lower-income partner. This was evident in clearer speech and less fidgeting—nonverbal signs of comfort that were observed more often in interactions with low-status individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this did not translate into greater social liking. When asked how much they enjoyed the interaction or how similar they felt to their partner, participants consistently rated those from similar class backgrounds more favorably. This preference for similarity, known as homophily, appeared to override the positive experience of being paired with a socially attuned and comforting partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our main findings revealed an interesting disconnect between automatic (physiologic and behavioral) versus more conscious (self-report) measures,” Tan told PsyPost. “Most of the interactions appeared positive—our video coding of interactions did not detect differences in positivity between cross-class or same-class interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we observed some asymmetries in interpersonal physiologic and behavioural responses based on participants’ social class backgrounds: Lower social class participants were more attentive/attuned to their interaction partners–based on our physiological linkage measure–regardless of the social class of interaction partners. This aligns with the broader research finding that lower social class individuals are generally more vigilant in navigating their social world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participants regardless of social class also appeared more comfortable–based on our coding of nonverbal behaviors–when interacting with partners from lower social class backgrounds,” Tan continued. “Interestingly, at the end of the interaction, participants still reported liking partners in same-class interactions more than in cross-class interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These distinct patterns tell us that the underlying nature of interactions is not completely obvious. While interactions appeared generally positive, lower social class individuals (compared to higher social class individuals) were more psychologically invested in the interaction by being more attentive, and this may have helped others feel more comfortable around them. However, these interpersonal processes did not override same-class preferences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s likely that a one-time positive interaction is insufficient to increase cross-class liking, so it would be interesting to see if repeated interactions would override same-class preferences over time. It’s also possible that engaging in a novel cross-class interaction is quite effortful–especially for individuals from lower social class backgrounds–and this can undermine the quality and experience of cross-class interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of conversational dynamics, the researchers expected that individuals from wealthier backgrounds might take more control of the conversation. But the study did not find evidence for this. People from different classes were equally likely to dominate or follow in conversation. The researchers suggest this may have been influenced by the structured nature of the interactions, which gave both participants equal chances to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a passive observer blind to the social class of participants (I sat through almost all the dyadic interactions to supervise the study–hidden, of course), it was not always obvious whether participants were similar or different in social class,” Tan said, “even though we paired them to be, until their conversation touched on things like where they went to school, what they did for a living, favourite vacation spot, the best gift they’ve given or received. We did observe, based on our manipulation checks, that participants quite accurately judged the social class of their interaction partners. So it seems that while social class cues are not always visible, they are still detectable through things we talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers important insights into how class influences the way people connect with each other during first-time meetings. But it also has limitations. Most notably, the sample was drawn entirely from the San Francisco Bay Area, a region with its own unique cultural and economic landscape. This may limit how broadly the findings apply to other populations. The racial composition of the sample also skewed toward majority groups, which made it difficult to study how race and class might interact during these encounters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the interactions were relatively brief and followed a structured format. While this approach ensured consistency across participants, it may not fully capture the subtleties of real-world conversations that unfold over longer periods or in less formal settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The major caveat/limitation is with the racial representation of our sample, as well as our inability to examine the role of other possible intersecting identities such as gender and race,” Tan noted. “Our study focused on isolating the role of social class by matching participant dyads on age, gender, and race.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may explore whether repeated interactions, rather than one-time encounters, can shift these patterns. It would also be helpful to examine whether similar results emerge in other regions or among more racially and culturally diverse populations. Understanding how to promote comfort and connection across class lines may play an important role in building more inclusive workplaces, schools, and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term goal is definitely to examine these patterns in different social settings (e.g., in schools, workplaces), in a different cultural context (e.g., non-Western), so see if the patterns hold or if patterns may vary,” Tan explained. “I am also interested in studying ways to improve the quality of cross-class interactions by reducing the observed social class asymmetries in attention and feelings of comfort during such interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, could such asymmetries be reduced in a setting completely free of social class cues or information? Could we reduce asymmetries by encouraging empathic curiosity prior to a cross-class interaction, such as by having people prepare questions that reflect interest in learning about the person and encourage sharing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251350970" target="_blank"&gt;Socioeconomic Status Shapes Dyadic Interactions: Examining Behavioral and Physiologic Responses&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jacinth J.

&lt;p&gt;The world's first telescope, crafted in 1608 by the Dutch eyeglass maker &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/21950-who-invented-the-telescope.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.space.com/21950-who-invented-the-telescope.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hans Lippershey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, led to stunning technologies that would later revolutionize our understanding of the universe. While his telescope used simple lenses to magnify objects to about three times their size, later scientists built on this concept to peer into the depths of outer space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some telescopes are more powerful than others, enabling us to spot distant stars and galaxies and allowing researchers to study extreme phenomena like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/black-holes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/black-holes"&gt;&lt;u&gt;black holes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/james-webb-telescope-zooms-in-on-bizarre-einstein-ring-caused-by-bending-of-the-universe" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/james-webb-telescope-zooms-in-on-bizarre-einstein-ring-caused-by-bending-of-the-universe"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Einstein rings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So, what's the most powerful telescope, and how far can it see into space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer isn't surprising to anyone familiar with today's headlines: The most powerful telescope is presently the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-space-telescope" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-space-telescope"&gt;&lt;u&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/james-webb-space-telescope" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/james-webb-space-telescope"&gt;JWST&lt;/a&gt;), which was launched in December 2021 to detect &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/50260-infrared-radiation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/50260-infrared-radiation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;infrared&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and near-infrared wavelengths, or wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to humans but can be felt as heat.

These problems range from light pollution to "atmospheric turbulence," which is the random movement of air. Such factors can blur and distort images and limit a telescope's ability to see deeply into space. Space, on the other hand, is darker and free of these problems, so many of our strongest telescopes are placed well beyond Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of James Webb, the telescope sits at a vantage point nearly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth at a Lagrange point, or a point that has just the right gravitational balance for satellites to stay stable in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0, the current contender for the most distant in the universe, is shown in the pullout taken by the James Webb Space Telescope.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, B.

It takes light from our sun &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-facts/" target="_blank" data-url="https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-facts/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;43.2 minutes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to reach Jupiter, but only 8 minutes to reach Earth. The distance to the outermost depths of the cosmos is vastly farther, which complicates the calculations. Measuring how far a telescope can see into space is not a straightforward process, Jakobsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hurdles astronomers regularly need to account for are the expansion of the universe and the finite &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/what-is-the-speed-of-light" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/what-is-the-speed-of-light"&gt;&lt;u&gt;speed of light&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he said. Astronomers bypass these complications by measuring the redshift of distant celestial bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redshift is what we see as celestial bodies accelerate farther and farther away from us. As the universe expands, the light emitted by faraway objects stretches to longer and "redder" wavelengths. The farther and longer the light travels, the greater its redshift becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, one of the farthest known redshift contenders is the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-discovers-the-2-earliest-galaxies-in-the-known-universe-and-1-is-shockingly-big" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-discovers-the-2-earliest-galaxies-in-the-known-universe-and-1-is-shockingly-big"&gt;&lt;u&gt;galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jakobsen said. Its redshift puts it at about 290 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another contender, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, is the galaxy &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/previously-unimaginable-james-webb-telescope-breaks-its-own-record-again-discovering-farthest-known-galaxy-in-the-universe" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/previously-unimaginable-james-webb-telescope-breaks-its-own-record-again-discovering-farthest-known-galaxy-in-the-universe"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MoM-z14&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has been dated to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang.

Now, researchers have found a way to turn this weakness into strength -- by transplanting healthy mitochondria into the tumor environment. In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combining mitochondrial transplantation with cisplatin not only enhanced immune cell infiltration but also reversed tumor metabolism and improved the drug's effectiveness. This innovative approach transforms mitochondria from mere energy suppliers into active allies in cancer therapy, showing potential to reshape how we treat aggressive lung tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of cases. Chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC, yet its effectiveness is hampered by toxic side effects and emerging resistance. Moreover, chemotherapy damages immune cells and reduces their presence in the tumor microenvironment, limiting long-term control. Adding to this challenge, tumors can hijack immune cell mitochondria through nanotube-like structures, further dampening immunity. Immunotherapy has improved outcomes for some, but many patients still fail to respond. Due to these limitations, there is a pressing need for strategies that restore immune power and metabolic balance during chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Tongji University School of Medicine and Nantong University published a study in &lt;em&gt;Cancer Biology &amp;amp; Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that introduces a novel approach to lung cancer therapy. They investigated whether direct mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. By combining functional mitochondria with cisplatin, the team aimed to not only improve tumor response but also restore immune vigor inside the tumor microenvironment. Their findings mark a significant step toward integrative treatments that energize both cells and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers isolated functional mitochondria from human cardiomyocytes -- cells known for their high energy output -- and transplanted them into NSCLC tumor models, both in vitro and in vivo. Alone, mitochondrial transplantation did not harm cancer cells, but when combined with cisplatin, it significantly amplified tumor suppression. This synergy reduced the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of cisplatin from 12.93 μM to 6.7 μM, indicating greater drug sensitivity. Tumors in mice shrank more dramatically with the combination therapy than with chemotherapy alone, and immune infiltration markedly increased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a striking shift in tumor metabolism: downregulation of glycolysis and hypoxia genes, and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways -- reversing the Warburg effect. Markers of cell proliferation (Ki67, P53) and stemness (HIF-1α, CD44, CD133) were suppressed. Importantly, mitochondrial transplantation also restored mitochondrial activity in immune cells, enhancing the function of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The treatment caused no additional toxicity and preserved body weight and organ integrity. This work demonstrates that mitochondria can serve as metabolic and immunologic reinforcements, transforming the tumor landscape into one more susceptible to immune attack and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research introduces a powerful dual-action strategy," said Dr. Liuliu Yuan, lead investigator of the study. "By replenishing immune cells with functional mitochondria, we are not just enhancing their energy -- but restoring their ability to fight. At the same time, tumor cells become more vulnerable to chemotherapy. It's like rearming the immune system while disarming the tumor. This could be a promising avenue for patients who don't respond well to conventional treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery lays the groundwork for a new therapeutic paradigm -- one that leverages the mitochondria's unique biology to augment cancer treatment. In patients with advanced NSCLC, mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of existing chemotherapy drugs while minimizing immune suppression. Beyond lung cancer, this approach may extend to other tumors where immune dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming are barriers to treatment success. With further refinement and clinical trials, mitochondrial transfer could evolve into a versatile platform for combination therapies, helping clinicians push past the current limits of cancer care and into a new era of bioenergetic and immune restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
