(WXIX) - The Kentucky Department for Public Health says people who were at the Ark Encounter and Holiday Express in Grant County on Dec. 31 may have been exposed to the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Kentucky Department for Public Health says the person, who was from out-of-state and unvaccinated, visited the Ark Encounter in Williamstown on Dec. 29 and stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Dry Ridge between Dec. 28-30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Being around so many people at a place such as the Ark Encounter creates the potential for wide exposure,” said NKY Health District Director for Health, Jennifer Mooney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“We want to make sure everyone who visited during that time is aware they may have been exposed to the measles, and they should monitor themselves for symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;If you visited either the Ark Encounter or the Holiday Inn Express between Dec. 28 - Dec. 30, you are recommended to to take these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check if you’ve received a measles-containing vaccine like the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, have medical documentation of past measles infection, or have laboratory evidence of immunity. Individuals born before 1957 are also considered immune.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Watch for symptoms. Monitor yourself for 21 days after your exposure. Look for any new symptoms including fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and rash, and contact your healthcare provider or local health department if symptoms develop. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid high-risk settings. If you are not immune, consider staying home to prevent the spread of measles. If you cannot remain home, avoid large gatherings or other places (like hospitals) where at-risk individuals could be. If you need medical care, call your provider ahead of time and let them know you have been exposed to measles so appropriate precautions can be taken. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Talk to a health care provider. If you have any questions about your health or immunity status, contact your health care provider. If you are not immune to measles, a healthcare provider can determine whether you can receive treatment to help prevent or lessen the severity of infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;See a spelling or grammatical error in our story? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox19.com/page/report-typos-to-fox19/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox19.com/page/report-typos-to-fox19/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;click here to report it&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?

You talk to the overwhelming majority of parents, good parents, they will take bullets for their children," the health secretary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There is that kind of innate sense of 'I will do everything I can to protect my child'. I don't think that's reflected sufficiently in the state," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The pilot scheme was part of that aim, he said, targeting families who are not signed up to a GP surgery or face language barriers, travel costs or childcare issues which stop them getting to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Uptake of childhood vaccines has declined over the past 10 years - &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-immunisation-statistics/england-2023-24" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;no jabs met the 95% coverage target for children aged five and below, according to the latest data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Twelve areas in London, the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire, the North West, and South West will test the approach over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The government said all other families should continue to have children vaccinated at their local surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Streeting said there had been a decline in the number of health visitors and community nursing over a number of years, and that government was developing a workforce plan to address recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Health visitors are registered nurses or midwives who have additional training in community public health nursing. They work with families with a child aged five and under to identify health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In response to Streeting's comments, the Conservatives accused Labour of having "no plan for children's health or the health service as a whole". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Labour are trying to distract from their dismal failures by pointing the finger at the last government," shadow health secretary Stuart Andrew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Steve Turner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, welcomed the plan and called on the health secretary to "right the wrongs of the past".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Addressing NHS waiting times, he said it was now a "matter of routine" that children were not being seen by health professionals within the NHS's 18-week target, adding that he was "particularly astounded" that a quarter of children wait more than a year for community treatment, compared with just 1% of adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Long waits for community and elective care are unacceptable at any age, but this is especially true for children where delays can cause irreversible and lifelong harm if care isn't provided during critical developmental windows," Prof Turner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He added that the unequal treatment of adults and children "must end" by tackling obesity, protecting mental health, reducing exposure to nicotine and boosting vaccinations in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Children up to the age of six across the UK are &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c860n445vyxo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;to be offered vaccine protection against chickenpox free on the NHS&lt;/a&gt; from January 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:04:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFA4NlJuTlFxNUFnQjBCS2RJdWlMS3B1Und0REZreFlXZWY2MzlTZ0RRY1pDOUtFa0lFdFYtemhLMXR5TzNtOUNaVHlLTzRiZXJXR1lLNVVTQUFwUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1ady1uMmR5YjZDSFRpQWQzakRIWWkySkRfbFNKUXVlbjRZOE5BNV9hMlpjY3VjTkRKRkswOVd2MXM1RTFXWHhZVlhGUEJGRXEwd2RlUHNWeFN6cUp5M3JV</guid></item><item><title>单次十分钟的锻炼可以阻止肠癌的进展-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/ten-minute-workout-bowel-cancer-v0lwq56tx</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-content-body" class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A ten-minute workout could halt bowel cancer growth, a study has suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scientists from Newcastle University say physical activity protects against bowel cancer progression, and that even a short spurt of exercise could cause a rapid molecular change in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The team, in work published in the Journal of Cancer, collected blood samples from 30 overweight or obese men who were otherwise healthy, before and after a 10 to 12-minute cycling session. They exposed &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/bowel-cancer-young-people-risk-symptoms-diagnosis-xq5tcjbhv" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells to the different blood samples and measured how the cells responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The burst of exercise increased the level of 13 proteins in the blood, many of which are linked to reduced inflammation, better blood vessel function and a better metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They found that when the blood taken&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; after exercise was applied to bowel cancer cells, 1,364 genes showed evidence of altered activity. The genes affected were involved in energy production, DNA repair and cancer cell growth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Last year researchers found that exercise was “better than a drug” for improving bowel cancer recovery, and the team behind the study believes that it may provide an explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/the-90-second-test-promising-to-spare-millions-from-colonoscopy-b6sdwh7kp" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The 90-second test promising to spare millions from colonoscopy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Sam Orange, senior lecturer in clinical exercise physiology at Newcastle University, who led the study, said: “Exercise doesn’t just benefit healthy tissues, it sends powerful signals through the bloodstream that can directly influence thousands of genes in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It opens the door to find ways that mimic or augment the biological effects of exercise … In the future, these insights could lead to new therapies that imitate the beneficial effects of exercise on how cells repair damaged DNA and use fuel for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“These results suggest that exercise doesn’t just benefit healthy tissues, it may also create a more hostile environment for cancer cells to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Even a single workout can make a difference. One bout of exercise, lasting just ten minutes, sends powerful signals to the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Genevieve Edwards, chief executive at the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: “Extensive research shows that people who are more physically active have a lower risk of bowel cancer as well as many other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We should be aiming for at least 150 minutes of activity each week, such as brisk walking, cycling or swimming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK. An estimated 44,000 people each year are diagnosed. It can develop anywhere in the large bowel, including the colon and rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The study adds to a growing body of evidence showing the positive effect of exercise on bowel cancer prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A previous study found that being more active in the mornings and evenings could help to cut the risk of bowel cancer by 11 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A team from the University of Regensburg in Germany used data from the UK Biobank to assess 86,252 people aged between 42 and 79 who tracked their physical activity using a device called an accelerometer. Over the follow-up period of 5.3 years, there were 529 cases of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers separated activity into four activity patterns: continuous ­day-long activity; activity late in the day; activity in the morning and evening; and activity at noon and at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The results, published in the journal BMC Medicine, demonstrated that two daily peaks of activity at 8am and 6pm “was associated with reduced colorectal cancer risk, beyond the benefits of overall physical activity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNZmRSNUZCRDFpTk94Q1d1cXNQZ0R2N0RRdGhQVG1jeDRsNG9SZ0l1SzlqU3JzQVl1SnlGX2lialREWG5FSHp6RFNNSm81R29scWpHanQ0VzdQUGg3bDRpUVlLM2tpUjhtRXVFUFlBWGlkV2diSUJCNnR6NmZROEQ4TS1TdHUydlY0dUVzc0MtNUJIdw</guid></item><item><title>波尔克县确诊与南卡罗来纳州疫情有关的麻疹病例- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/lifestyles/health/measles-case-confirmed-polk-county-linked-south-carolina-outbreak-december-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated child tested positive for measles in Polk
County, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS said the child visited locations in Spartanburg
County, South Carolina, linked to a large ongoing measles outbreak in upstate
South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The child developed symptoms of measles before Christmas and
has since recovered. The state is not releasing any other information about the
child to protect the family’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS has been in communication with the South Carolina
Department of Public Health since the beginning of their measles response. This
is the second measles case recorded in North Carolina this year and the first
believed to be related to the South Carolina outbreak. &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-first-measles-case-june-2025/"&gt;North
Carolina’s first measles case&lt;/a&gt; this year involved an international traveler
in June.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS recommends people 1 year and older receive a measles
vaccination to protect themselves and those around them.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Getting vaccinated against measles continues to be the most important step we can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones,” said NCDHHS State Epidemiologist Dr. Zack Moore in a news release. “It is important to check with your health care provider to ensure you are current with all your vaccines.”   &lt;/p&gt;

            The United States has reported more than 2,000 measles cases this year, federal data shows, a higher annual total than the country has seen in decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00023b6sfx6h7tfz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ongoing outbreaks — particularly in the upstate region of &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/health/measles-surge-us-south-carolina"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and along the border between Arizona and Utah — continue to add dozens of cases each week, threatening the measles elimination status that the US has held for a quarter-century.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00033b6szl8e6501@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of December 30, there have been 2,065 confirmed measles cases in the US in 2026, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last time there were more than 2,000 cases reported in one year was in 1992, just a couple years after health leaders updated recommendations to say that children should get two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine instead of just one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00043b6s2wad5xuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known, but the MMR vaccine offers highly effective protection. One dose is 93% effective against measles infection, and two doses are 97% effective, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00053b6stz20hqrt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, vaccination rates have been falling for years. Last school year, just 92.5% of incoming kindergarteners had received the MMR vaccine, CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; shows — below the 95% threshold that public health experts say is necessary to prevent outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00063b6sxct1gmfb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles has been considered eliminated in the US since 2000, meaning no outbreaks or other chains of transmission have lasted longer than a year. But multiple large outbreaks this year may be connected, which puts the elimination status on the line if cases continue to grow through late January.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00073b6sxdxirl7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An outbreak centered in West Texas that started in late January was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared over&lt;/a&gt; in mid-August. There were hundreds of related cases across Texas and New Mexico, and three unvaccinated people died: two children and one adult.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00083b6sfdarnre0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In early October, the South Carolina health department confirmed that there was a measles outbreak in the upstate region. That outbreak has spread to nearly 180 cases over the past four months and continues to grow; at least 20 new cases have been reported since Friday, and nearly 300 people are in quarantine because of exposure to a known case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix00093b6ss9a5jdbk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that a large number of our cases are those who we’ve placed in quarantine because of known exposures,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Tuesday. Measles continues to spread through household transmission, in schools and at churches, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000a3b6shehanvfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An outbreak on the Utah-Arizona line also continues to grow, with more than 350 cases reported between the two states this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000b3b6sm2mtvxf6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In November, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, determined that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Canada had lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; amid a large ongoing outbreak there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000c3b6sh40s4nty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important to say that all the other 34 countries in the region, they keep their certification as measles-free,” PAHO Director Dr. Jarbas Barbosa said at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000d3b6szfkan1xk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But possible genetic links between the Texas outbreak and the ongoing South Carolina outbreak put that status at risk for the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmjuejwix000e3b6s23vtoqrn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The trajectory that we’re looking at now is that we do anticipate more cases well into January,” Bell said. “What that means for us nationally in terms of how they are defining our designation in this country as having eliminated measles is unclear.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

This time, however, it’s not COVID-19, but flu, which is also now circulating widely in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 800 people (782) in Colorado are now hospitalized with flu, that’s almost 250 more than a week ago, 430 more than two weeks ago and 12 times the number the state recorded in mid-November. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total is almost 300 more than last season’s peak of around 500 in early February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers are in record-shattering territory. This same week in 2014, 582 people were hospitalized with flu, in what was the worst recent season in Colorado. That’s according to the state health department’s &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Nr7nUl8vu_yLll3lEDFcqoPiXTycjti/view"&gt;2015 flu season annual report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;Courtesy Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The 782 new flu-related hospitalizations reported for the week ending Dec. 27 is a record for raw numbers of influenza hospitalizations reported in one week since we started tracking influenza hospitalizations in 2004,” said CDPHE spokesperson Hope Shuler, in an email. “We saw a similar rate of hospitalization (40 per 100,000) during the 2024-2025 season, but that figure wasn’t reached until roughly four weeks later, in late January.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line on this week’s flu hospitalization graph is now nearly vertical, charging almost straight up on the website of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment that tracks viral activity, which was updated Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shuler said the agency expects hospitals can handle the wave with increased staffing and surge capacity to manage increased volume. “We expect hospitalizations to continue to increase in the immediate future as a result of recent holiday gatherings and return to school, child care and work,” she said. “At this time, hospital bed capacity for adults and pediatrics remains within the ranges we would typically expect during this time of year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu season in Colorado began about four weeks earlier than usual, which follows trends seen internationally this year in the UK and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're continuing to see steadily increasing numbers of kids with the flu with no end in sight.  Just by sheer volume, that's led to larger than normal numbers of our patients hospitalized or in the ED (emergency department) with flu-related complications like pneumonias, dehydration, and respiratory distress,” said Dr. Shen Nagel, a pediatrician with Wheat Ridge clinic Pediatrics West, via email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've seen a lot of our patients where flu has ripped through the whole family including higher-risk relatives like grandparents or young babies,” he said. “The only saving grace thus far … has been that other respiratory illnesses such as RSV and COVID haven't exploded yet, so thus far, no ‘tripledemic’ repeat,” Nagel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of tests coming back positive, called the weekly sentinel positivity rate, is nearly 34 percent, which means many are testing positive for flu when they show up coughing, sneezing and sniffling in hospitals, urgent cares, clinics, community health centers and doctor’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 10 percent of visits to hospital emergency departments are now being diagnosed with flu and it’s showing up in all of the 21 utilities monitoring for it in wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual systems are tracking the increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As of yesterday, across our system we have 152 patients hospitalized with flu, so we’re trending higher than last flu season, when our peak was 114 in early February,” said Kelli Christensen, public &amp;amp; media relations Director with UCHealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall respiratory illness activation in Colorado is high, according to the website. The only bright spot is that so far, hospitalization for COVID-19 and RSV have remained relatively flat, with both recording about 60 hospitalizations each. But those viruses bear watching too, since all the key metrics for them are also on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado’s &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5661508/flu-cdc-health"&gt;flu boom mirrors&lt;/a&gt; what is being seen nationally, with cases rising sharply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, last week more than 19,000 flu patients with influenza were admitted to hospitals, which was an increase of around 10,000 from the prior week, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;new CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency estimated some 7.5 million people have been sickened, and over 3,100 people have died from the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Colorado, &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/12/23/colorado-flu-season-test-vaccinate-at-home/"&gt;one child has died&lt;/a&gt; from the flu. CDPHE last week confirmed the death, an elementary school-aged child from metro Denver, as the first influenza-associated pediatric death of the 2025-26 viral respiratory disease season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older who has not yet been vaccinated this season get an annual flu vaccine. Approximately 130 million doses of influenza vaccine have been distributed in the United States this season, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html"&gt;agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all the news of flu illness, Coloradans are so far not taking the step that doctors say provides the best protection: getting immunized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s immunization numbers are woefully short of what public health officials and doctors say would provide much better community protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-seven percent of Coloradans, about 1.5 percent less than this time last year, have &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/respiratory-virus-immunization-data"&gt;received a flu vaccination&lt;/a&gt; this season, according to the state’s dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little less than half (49%) of one of the most vulnerable groups, those 65 and older, have gotten a flu shot. Of those 6 months to 9 years old, 29 percent have gotten a flu vaccine; just about 20 percent of those 10-19 years have gotten it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hispanic Coloradans are trailing other racial and ethnic groups with just over 7 percent having gotten immunized, according to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagel said doctors and public health workers are having to clear up some public misunderstandings about this year’s vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's been a lot of publicity about the ‘mismatch’ between the vaccine and circulating strains and, unfortunately, it seems far less about the data that even the mismatched vaccine provides up to 50-75 percent reductions in serious illness or hospitalization, especially in children,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And shorter illnesses can lead to less contagious time and decrease overall spread. So our ongoing discussions with holdouts have had to counter the resistance based on misperceptions that the vaccine isn't helping this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the H3N2 subclade K strain — the current dominant flu strain circulating — is a slight mismatch to this year’s vaccine, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12639273/#:~:text=Influenza%20A(H3N2)%20subclade%20K%20(J.,influenza%20A(H3N2)%20viruses."&gt;early data&lt;/a&gt; remains “very encouraging,” Shuler said. “The vaccine is still performing well where it matters most, preventing about three-fourths of pediatric hospitalizations or emergency care and about a third of adult hospitalizations or emergency care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Everyday precautions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, along with taking precautions to prevent infection, remain the most effective tools to prevent severe illness and hospitalizations, Shuler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggests Coloradans can take everyday prevention measures to help reduce the transmission of respiratory illnesses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article__contained wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay home when sick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your shirt sleeve, not your hands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid close contact with others who are sick, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs and mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may choose to wear a mask for protection from respiratory viruses. “Be respectful of everyone’s choices,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Colorado Public Radio</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:40:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9GTzMwU0lISWxtbnUzcE9OMWI2eHRxSDdKd3B2Sk9MZ1o4NmZlUzliM1lQVGNES00tbGRGV2I4ekNZUUd6MFlZUHB4ZzRhRC1hZDkyU3IzTU9mb3RYZ01BYzBoeUNOc0tuNTVKWkl3</guid></item><item><title>许多死于自杀的人没有抑郁症- futurity.org</title><link>https://www.futurity.org/suicide-depression-genetics-3319172/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="stickem-container"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Many people who die by suicide aren’t depressed, new genetic research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among friends and family of those who die by suicide, a common refrain is: I didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some people who die by suicide have prior attempts, about half of people who die by suicide have no documented suicidal thoughts or behaviors, nor do they have known psychiatric conditions associated with suicide risk, like depression. They have no previous clear indicators that they might be at risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need help, call 988 to reach a free, confidential 24/7 support line for suicidal crisis or emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new genetic study at the University of Utah found that people in this group of unexpected suicides aren’t just flying under the clinical radar via lower access to psychiatric services—their underlying risk factors may be fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research found that people who die by suicide without prior non-fatal suicidal thoughts or behaviors have fewer psychiatric diagnoses and also fewer underlying genetic risk factors for psychiatric conditions compared to people who had shown these warning signs before dying by suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of people out there who may be at risk of suicide where it’s not just that you’ve missed that they’re depressed, it’s likely that they’re in fact actually not depressed,” says Hilary Coon, professor of psychiatry in the Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine and first author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is important in widening our view of who may be at risk. We need to start to think about aspects leading to risk in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.38204"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, upend conventional beliefs about suicide risk and suggest new approaches to help save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other research had shown that people who die by suicide without prior known suicidality are less likely to have psychiatric diagnoses, such as depression, compared to people with documented suicidal thoughts or behaviors. But nobody knew the root cause of this difference. Maybe, researchers thought, people without known suicidality are still just as depressed or anxious—they’re just undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Coon’s team was surprised to find that this isn’t the case. Instead, they found that this group has different genetic risk factors from people with known suicidality. By comprehensively analyzing anonymized genetic data from more than 2,700 people who died by suicide, the researchers found that people without prior suicidality tend to have fewer genetic risk factors for several psychiatric conditions, including major depressive disorder, anxiety, Alzheimer’s disease, and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetic data also suggests that this group isn’t any more likely than the general population to have milder conditions, like depressed mood and neuroticism. This means that conventional wisdom on how to reduce suicide may need to be rethought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A tenet in suicide prevention has been that we just need to screen people better for associated conditions like depression,” Coon explains. “And if people had the same sort of underlying vulnerabilities, then additional efforts in screening might be very helpful. But for those who actually have different underlying vulnerabilities, then increasing that screening might not help for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how to find and treat these “hidden” at-risk individuals is a major focus of Coon’s upcoming research. Previous studies with clinical data have shown potential links between suicide risk and hard-to-treat conditions like chronic pain. Coon is also investigating how other physical disorders, such as inflammation and respiratory conditions, may impact suicide risk. Her work will also focus on traits that may confer resilience to suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coon emphasizes that, on their own, individual genetic risk factors related to suicide have very small effects on risk, and there’s no single gene—or combination of genes—that causes suicide. Environmental and societal contexts are crucial contributors to risk, and understanding the interplay between the environment and underlying biology will be essential to discovering who’s at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope our work will begin to define subsets of individuals at risk, and also the contexts in which these risk characteristics may be important,” Coon says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people have a certain type of clinical diagnosis that makes them particularly vulnerable within particular environmental contexts, they still may not ever say they’re suicidal. We hope our work may help reveal traits and contexts associated with high risk so that doctors can deliver care more effectively and specifically. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better identification of at-risk individuals will help people get the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, Janssen Research &amp;amp; Development, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the Brain &amp;amp; Behavior Research Foundation–National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression, and the Clark Tanner Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease blood test developer Quanterix put forward new clinical data from its Simoa assay, which it described as the largest population-based assessment of the condition’s neuropathological changes to date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09841-y"&gt;in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the research showed that the company’s ultrasensitive test for the phosphorylated tau-217 biomarker could help identify potentially higher-than-expected rates of Alzheimer’s-related dementia among older individuals—a number that rises sharply from 10% among people between ages 58 and 70 to nearly 65% in those over 90. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The company said the results also suggest its blood test could help find people at risk before symptoms begin to show, who could then seek early treatment or enroll in a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“For decades, accurately mapping the true prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease pathology in the general population was hindered because we lacked scalable, accurate blood-based tools,” said the study’s senior author, Nicholas Ashton, Ph.D., senior director of Banner Health’s fluid biomarker program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Critically, our findings—which indicate that 10% of the 70+ population meet current treatment eligibility criteria—provide vital, actionable data for public health authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as they plan for future care and access to disease-modifying therapies,” Ashton said in a &lt;a href="https://www.quanterix.com/press-releases/quanterix-announces-landmark-nature-study-redefining-alzheimers-disease-neuropathology-prevalence/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers analyzed more than 11,400 samples collected through the Norwegian Trøndelag Health trial, known as the Hunt study, which has been ongoing for more than 40 years. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Plasma pTau-217 concentrations increased with age. The study also found that about a third of the 70-plus population was affected—with 10% having preclinical Alzheimer's, 10.4% having prodromal disease and 9.8% having related dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Quanterix’s blood test was also used to rule out Alzheimer’s related changes in some cases, including in 41% of people with mild cognitive impairment and 19% of those with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The sheer scale of this research underscores the indispensable role of highly sensitive biomarker detection in advancing public health understanding,” said Quanterix CEO Masoud Toloue, Ph.D. “Our Simoa technology continues to be the enabling platform for generating population-level epidemiological insights that are necessary for planning drug development, optimizing clinical trials, and preparing healthcare systems for the future of Alzheimer’s treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The pTau-217 research assay taps into a biomarker kit from developer ALZpath, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/siemens-healthineers-taps-alzpath-alzheimers-blood-test-biomarker"&gt;licensed the antibody&lt;/a&gt; to Siemens Healthineers for use on its Atellica immunoassay platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="omeda-promo-article-inline-after-pos10" class="olytics_injection"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-clears-fujirebios-blood-test-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease"&gt;cleared its first blood test&lt;/a&gt; for use in diagnosing Alzheimer’s earlier this year, with Fujirebio’s Lumipulse G that checks for pTau-217 and beta amyloid. Roche later &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/roche-nabs-fda-clearance-alzheimers-biomarker-blood-test"&gt;secured a green light&lt;/a&gt; for its pTau-181 blood test in October. &lt;/p&gt;

Brain cell damage was halted, inflammation was reduced, and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; (the brain's protective shield) was also restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were very excited and encouraged by our results," &lt;a href="https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist and psychiatrist Andrew Pieper, from Case Western Reserve University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mouse-study-suggests-nose-picking-has-a-surprising-link-with-alzheimers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouse Study Suggests Nose-Picking Has a Surprising Link With Alzheimer's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P7C3-A20 was selected as a neuroprotective compound known to restore the balance of NAD+ (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinamide_adenine_dinucleotide"&gt;nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&lt;/a&gt;).

In fact, some of the same researchers have already demonstrated that P7C3-A20 and its NAD+ boosting powers can repair mouse brains &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010430117"&gt;after head injuries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this follow-up study, NAD+ levels returned to normal in mice with advanced symptoms after six months of daily injections. Related biomarkers for inflammation and DNA damage also indicated there was sufficient NAD+ for cells to function normally again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested two mouse models of Alzheimer's, each related to one of the disease's two hallmark pathologies – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid-beta protein plaques&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-study-reveals-how-toxic-clumps-warp-neurons-at-their-core"&gt;tau protein tangles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been theorized that these &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;abnormal clumps of protein&lt;/a&gt; have a role in the death of neurons and brain function disruption in Alzheimer's, though the relationship has been unclear. While P7C3-A20 restored brain function, it didn't clear out these plaques and tangles, suggesting that cells may be able to deal with the aggregated proteins if they are firing on all cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Restoring the brain's energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer's," &lt;a href="https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Pieper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seeing this effect in two very different animal models, each driven by different genetic causes, strengthens the new idea that recovery from advanced disease might be possible in people with AD when the brain's NAD+ balance is restored."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a long way to go before we know whether treatments like this one can repair and reverse the damage of Alzheimer's disease in humans. That will require more animal studies and carefully designed  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="187209" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is a clear sign that NAD+ could be a crucial factor in future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those treatments will have to be carefully controlled and calibrated, as an overload of NAD+ has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2011.02733.x"&gt;linked to cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the past. And with a disease as complex as Alzheimer's, it's likely that a complex solution is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key takeaway is a message of hope – the effects of Alzheimer's disease may not be inevitably permanent," &lt;a href="https://case.edu/news/new-study-shows-alzheimers-disease-can-be-reversed-achieve-full-neurological-recovery-not-just-prevented-or-slowed-animal-models"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Pieper.

In South Carolina this month, a measles outbreak topped 175 cases, mostly among unvaccinated individuals, with hundreds quarantined. The resurgence of measles is seen by doctors and public health experts as a harbinger of the return of other deadly, vaccine-preventable illnesses, like whooping cough, which has killed three&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;children in Kentucky in the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="6K35KX4RAZEEPFAUJTSH43ZWOY" data-contentid="6K35KX4RAZEEPFAUJTSH43ZWOY"&gt;For generations, schools have required children to have proof of vaccination as a step toward protecting entire communities, starting with Massachusetts’ adoption of a school mandate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for the smallpox vaccine in 1855. Following the success of the polio and measles vaccines in the mid-20th Century, schools and the American public widely supported vaccination. By the 1980-1981 school year, all 50 states had vaccination laws covering students first entering school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="Image" class="wpds-c-bTCZLY wpds-c-bTCZLY-idZwvW-type-default component-image"&gt;&lt;figure id="image-FUXREBFDCXRH2K5VQUBN34U3GY" class="wpds-c-PJLV wpds-c-PJLV-iossVB-type-medium"&gt;&lt;img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FUXREBFDCXRH2K5VQUBN34U3GY_size-normalized.JPG&amp;amp;high_res=true&amp;amp;w=2048 1x" src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FUXREBFDCXRH2K5VQUBN34U3GY_size-normalized.JPG&amp;amp;high_res=true&amp;amp;w=2048"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wpds-c-kaVXjn wpds-c-kaVXjn-jBafdS-type-notLarge"&gt; Minnesota, where Becker Primary School is, has recorded one of the largest drops in vaccination rates among states since 2018.

Objections to mandates of all kinds intensified after the coronavirus pandemic, with some&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Republican-controlled states&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;taking action. This year, Florida’s governor and top health official &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/03/florida-vaccine-mandates-ended/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;announced a push&lt;/a&gt; to abolish school&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;vaccine mandates altogether,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;as the measles vaccination rate in the state fell more than 5 percent since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="BBKQJN43Y5F23JMVLMBSF3UBEI" data-contentid="BBKQJN43Y5F23JMVLMBSF3UBEI"&gt;Vaccination has become such a hot-button political issue in some states that the dynamic is similar to battles over reproductive health — and local school officials don’t want to be in the crossfire, said James Colgrove, a professor at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;who has studied the role of schools in public health. That means more children will pick up infections in school and bring them home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="2MRLNG7SM5GR7NZM4HEVWPJ6LU" data-contentid="2MRLNG7SM5GR7NZM4HEVWPJ6LU"&gt;“The most dangerous deadly diseases will come back and it won’t only be kids who suffer,” he said. “It’ll be adults in the community who are immune-compromised, who are elderly.

Such information is not typically communicated to parents. Reporters reviewed and mapped tens of thousands of individual schools’ data, assembling the most comprehensive public database. In some states, unvaccinated rates could reflect missing immunization records for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="UOHSNPOD5VHYRAPOOJHCHVX2TY" data-contentid="UOHSNPOD5VHYRAPOOJHCHVX2TY"&gt;The Post also spoke to over 75 medical experts, parents, school nurses, vaccine and anti-vaccine advocates, and contacted every state health department in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="EY7TW7NVBRACLHBORFXQPNEN5Y" data-contentid="EY7TW7NVBRACLHBORFXQPNEN5Y"&gt;The results showed wide variation in rates, depending on geography. While children in California, which does not allow for nonmedical vaccine exemptions, are vaccinated against measles at 96 percent, there is not a single county in Idaho,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Louisiana, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah or Wisconsin whose kindergarten rates meet herd immunity protection level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-dMWJvi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="3MDY5OG3JJF6FJACDNA7HCMC6U" data-contentid="3MDY5OG3JJF6FJACDNA7HCMC6U"&gt;Counties that Trump won in 2024 were more likely to lose ground on kindergarten vaccination rates in recent years than those won by then-Vice President Kamala Harris. But blue cities still saw dips as well. St. Louis reported just 74 percent of kindergartners vaccinated against measles. A quarter of kindergartners in the Ouachita Parish, Louisiana, which&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;includes the city of Monroe, are unvaccinated. In Maine, Alabama and Connecticut, vaccination rates went up since the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="Text" class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-idAgRsb-css component-text" id="ZW5OSXLPNRHVDNWPXMDAS6A2ME" data-contentid="ZW5OSXLPNRHVDNWPXMDAS6A2ME"&gt;“We have very different levels of health and protection based on Zip codes, and children don’t get to choose where they live or where they go to school,” said Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “For pediatricians, immunization is a child health priority, not a partisan issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="PJLV PJLV-iWxNPu-css"&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-llABtw"&gt;A map showing the change in vax rates by county, which shows that rates decreased across the board.

To analyze how the pandemic affected rates, we examined the academic years 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2023-2024 and 2024-2025. Data was gathered from publicly available government websites or through public records requests filed with state and local agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;Thirty-four states and D.C. provided school-level vaccination data. Two states — Texas and Kansas — provided district-level public school data, which creates an undercount because even the largest districts were counted as a single school in the analysis. When a state did not provide MMR-specific figures, an overall vaccination rate reflecting students up-to-date on all required vaccines was used. MMR rates reflect two doses of the vaccine, and in some states represent the vaccination for measles specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;There are several reasons certain schools are not found in the data. Many states suppressed data for schools with low student enrollment (typically less than 10 or 20 students). Some schools did not report data to the state. Also, reporters removed data reported for online or virtual schools based on school names. Vaccination rates could also be impacted by missing records for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;The exemption rates reported for schools are not just for the MMR vaccine and in some cases reflect exemptions students received for other vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;Forty-four states and D.C. provided county-level vaccination data. In counties where school-level data was not made available, individual school vaccine rates in our database reflect a county average that is weighted by enrollment. If student enrollment data was not provided, reporters collected it from National Center for Education Statistics databases. In some cases, the state provided data based on geography other than counties; reporters translated these to county-equivalent regions for mapping and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;For county and school-level data, “post-pandemic” typically refers to the 2024-2025 school year, but some states provided only 2023-2024 data. “Pre-pandemic” years include school years starting in 2018 or 2019. Some states’ rates did not differentiate between kindergartners and students in other grades; when grades above kindergarten are included, that is stated in the state-specific notes in the interactive map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;For statewide vaccination and exemption rates, reporters used CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from 2018 and 2024, with the exception of Montana (no post-pandemic data), Alaska (pre-pandemic year is 2017), the&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;District of Columbia (pre-pandemic year is 2015) and West Virginia (post-pandemic year is 2023). The CDC’s reported vaccination rates are based on a survey of a representative sample of schools in each state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;In roughly two dozen states where exact school addresses weren’t provided, reporters geocoded each building in the following manner: First, schools were matched to National Center for Education Statistics data. Those without a close match were then searched for location matches using Google and Geocodio tools. Those that still didn’t match to a street address were checked by hand. In several states, a number of schools listed no exact addresses, were not included in federal datasets and did not appear in web searches. Those were geocoded to the center of the nearest geography provided — either a street, city or county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;County-level or school-level kindergarten vaccination rates were considered to be below herd immunity if they were less than 95 percent. To calculate the number of kindergarten-age children in counties that fell below herd immunity, reporters used the Census Bureau’s current population estimates for 5- and 6-year-olds. To measure the political split of counties, reporters used 2024 presidential vote margins. To calculate the number of schools below herd immunity, we used&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the most recent year provided by each state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-foYyTm wpds-c-foYyTm-ikHxsIg-css component-text"&gt;For more detailed methodological notes and to download this data, click &lt;a href="https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-school-vaccination-rates?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:00:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPQURuZkNzaW5wa2RuUk5zRFdROXpIcFN6dG5TajJfeVI2MlJaejVPUEtEeExkalBQQUdRTVp3ZERSWlNxVXdyZGFJdlB0RFllYUNYSEkxa2xPTVh3cHNQNHBfUGg3cmF0TzliSGlYYWJycUI3MjdqaXhxZ1hwUktwcDBqNE1jekNCVGlvQXhobkFtOWVuOWlnZ2tuaTFkTGpIUU1pNklR</guid></item><item><title>《每日邮报》图片揭示了瓶装水中最致癌的“永久化学物质” --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15423263/bottled-water-PFAS-forever-chemicals.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bottled water is typically seen as the safer drinking choice compared to tap water, as it is filtered, free of lead, agricultural pesticides and industrial pollutants that might not be fully weeded out of municipal systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14292761/scientists-reveal-tap-bottled-water-safer-toxic-chemicals.html"&gt;lab tests have shown&lt;/a&gt; that, contrary to popular opinion, a pricier bottle does not mean purer water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, tests commissioned by the consumer watchdog app Oasis Health found plastic-derived 'forever chemicals' to be ubiquitous in bottled water, from budget-friendly brands like Deer Park and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/poland/index.html" id="mol-23895320-e5bc-11f0-a88e-171c7d23bae2"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; Spring to upmarket favorites such as Essentia and Topo Chico. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forever chemicals, known for repelling water and stains, coat the insides of plastic water bottles and their caps to prevent leaks. They are byproducts of plastic production that can take decades or even centuries to break down in both the environment and the human body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, these chemicals accumulate in the environment and the body, seeping into the water and food supply, becoming ubiquitous. When PFAS accumulate in the body's tissues, they disrupt essential biological processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes interfering with hormone regulation, sabotaging the body’s ability to clear out bad cholesterol, promoting cancer-causing inflammation and, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13052757/plastic-containers-premature-birth-toxic-forever-chemicals.html"&gt;in pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, disrupting fetal development, potentially leading to learning and developmental delays later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic is known to be full of forever chemicals, and many people choose glass bottles to avoid the toxins, but now, testing has revealed that even water in glass bottles is not safe from PFAS contamination, which can also occur during the purification process, when water is stored or filtered through plastic systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bottled water is marketed as a clean escape from tap water contaminants like lead and pesticides. Yet lab tests prove a higher price does not mean purer water (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The EPA sets a PFAS exposure limit at 0.4 parts per trillion (ppt), but the health guideline most researchers agree on is 0.1 ppt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oasis analysts scored thousands of bottled water brands, including Deer Park, SmartWater, Dasani and Fiji, among others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scoring methodology is a comprehensive, points-based system. For each product, a base score out of 100 is adjusted using penalties for risks and bonuses for transparency. The closer their ranking got to 100, the less contaminated they were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, bottled water is penalized for missing third-party lab reports, the presence of contaminants, unsafe packaging materials, like certain plastics, or sourcing from municipal supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bonuses are awarded for brand transparency, like publishing test data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The final score places the product into a clear risk band, from ‘Excellent’ (90–100) to ‘Very Poor’ (below 60), providing a standardized, science-backed way for consumers to compare the health safety of products within the same category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most instances, Oasis analysts did not specify the types of forever chemicals found in different bottles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS is a category that encompasses hundreds of molecules, each with its own risk profile, some known and some unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without knowing the specific chemical involved, it is difficult to gauge the risk associated with picking up a bottle of that water at the store.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFOA, a type of PFAS for instance, has strong links to kidney and testicular cancer, as well as liver damage and thyroid disease. PFOS, another type of forever chemical, is most closely associated with kidney and thyroid cancer, as well as liver damage and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the worst performers contained PFAS concentrations of about 0.2 ppt, which is roughly double the health guideline for the chemicals agreed upon by environmental scientists across a wide body of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there were two stand outs with even worse scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Topo Chico, 3.9 ppt, and Perrier, 1.7 ppt, had PFAS concentrations 39 times and 17 times the safe limit, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Deer Park, 1.21 ppt, had PFAS concentrations at 12 times the safe limit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Essentia, Dasani, Smartwater and Aquafina, also each contained PFAS at a level of 0.2 parts per trillion (ppt).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiji was the only product that didn't exceed PFAS levels, with 0.05 ppt, but it did test positive for arsenic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this trace amount is extremely low, it is still twice the EPA's stringent 0.004 ppt health advisory goal for PFOA, one of the most toxic PFAS chemicals. This indicates that even waters marketed as pure or enhanced contain these persistent industrial pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most alarming was Perrier Sparkling Water's high concentration of HFPO-DA (also known as GenX), a common PFOA replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research, though less extensive than for PFOA or PFOS, indicates concerning health effects of GenX exposure. Animal studies have pointed to an elevated risk of liver toxicity, lesions in the kidneys and atrophied pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GenX is likely carcinogenic in humans, according to the EPA, based on animal studies that have linked the chemical to liver, pancreas and testicular tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS is a common contaminant in many household items from cookware to hamburger wrappers. It can remain in the environment as well as human tissue for years, even decades, before being cleared out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many public health experts and organizations argue that there is no truly safe level of exposure to PFAS like PFOA and PFOS due to their extreme persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity at very low doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problem is escalating as scientists link harmful health effects to increasingly minuscule PFAS concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, official ‘safe’ limits for these chemicals in drinking water become obsolete almost as soon as they are set. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, the EPA's recommended limit for PFOA alone has plummeted from 400 ppt in 2009 to 70 ppt in 2016; today, some states enforce limits as low as 0.1 ppt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This drastic tightening applies to just one of thousands of PFAS compounds. Research shows people typically carry a mixture of multiple PFAS in their bodies simultaneously. It is now believed that over 200 million Americans have PFAS in their tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:44:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQTHQ4ejhKVXBfa01tQ0s5LTRrWUdabXkzNUhHY3EyUzVUVTdaVl9qakZYaUlvcDBtNE92U1FtQXpueUNLY21FY3FOZUpOcXZrczFYcGNfVmdkM1lPbDJsUFF4ODNkRW1lMXNINkNIVXJMNjlvc1V0cGRfMXgzbGwxd2xfQXBodE1SZG5VSzFxbG9Zb0pKNmQ0dtIBngFBVV95cUxPVDVnZnBzR1NSY0ozUFpGZGh0Uk5UZVkySEZRRkdNRFA4Z0ZIdzItLXZvWFZ5UC1CYTZxVUlNbkFPRDJkalp6RlIwMUNXNjZYaW9XRmU1ZkI4UlRaNDktNlRGdy1IV1lpSGx4SEVPNm9EblNjNC01bzB4OGhCQlBVbHNqNmQ0ZUU2UXlvUE1Hb1Y1cE9JdWdEdDJFeVVvdw</guid></item><item><title>这个7分钟的早晨站立例行公事在50岁后的30天内收缩肚子狗-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/7-minute-morning-standing-routine-belly-pooch-after-50/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;

They’re a productive way to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/functional-strength-exercises-for-mobility/" target="_blank"&gt;boost functional strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-core-strength-better-than-planks-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;core stability&lt;/a&gt; while improving mobility, posture, and balance. Because &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-strength-exercises-fight-muscle-loss-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;standing exercises&lt;/a&gt; activate more muscle groups than seated workouts, they also give your circulation and metabolism noticeable improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with experts who share how standing moves can help &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/chair-exercises-shrink-belly-pooch-over-50-no-planks/" target="_blank"&gt;shrink your belly pooch&lt;/a&gt; in 30 days after the age of 50. The best part? A productive workout can take just seven minutes out of your morning—which makes it easy to stay consistent to reach your goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes exercising in the morning so productive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;b&gt;Karen Ann Canham&lt;/b&gt;, CEO and founder of&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.karenannwellness.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Karen Ann Wellness&lt;/a&gt;, “&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/morning-moves-stronger-than-30-year-olds-after-55/" target="_blank"&gt;Morning movement&lt;/a&gt; is effective because cortisol levels are naturally higher which helps mobilize stored fat. The body is also less inflamed after rest which allows the core muscles to engage more easily. Moving early improves insulin sensitivity which supports fat loss. Morning routines set posture and alignment for the entire day. This reduces tension patterns that contribute to belly pooch. Energy levels are often steadier before daily stress accumulates. Consistent morning movement creates momentum that supports long-term change.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seven-minute workout below features dynamic movements like squats, jumping jacks, marches, and knee-to-elbow crunches. Each exercise is typically performed for 40 seconds with 20 seconds of rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This provides a continuous, heart-pumping, core-engaging routine that boosts metabolism to help melt visceral belly fat and improve overall fitness without floor work,” explains &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://thwarrior.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Eric North&lt;/a&gt;, aka The Happiness Warrior—a wellness speaker, coach, and advocate redefining what it means to age with purpose, strength, and emotional vitality. “Remember to learn to listen to our bodies, go at our own pace and ALWAYS consult a physician before committing to an intense exercise program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform each exercise for 40 seconds, resting for 20 seconds between each move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jumping Jacks (Or Step Jacks for a Lower-Impact Alternative):&lt;/b&gt; This exercise increases your heart rate and puts your entire body to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bodyweight Squats:&lt;/b&gt; North encourages you to emphasize proper form, descending as if you’re about to sit on a chair. Increase the challenge by performing deep squats, increasing and lengthening the squat position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plank Shoulder Taps:&lt;/b&gt; This core stability move requires assuming a plank position, then alternating tapping opposite shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reverse Lunges:&lt;/b&gt; For this move, you’ll step back and lower into a lunge—keeping your front knee over your ankle—then, you’ll press back up to the start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mountain Climbers (Or Marching in Place):&lt;/b&gt; For this exercise, you’ll alternate driving a knee toward your chest in a swift yet controlled motion from a high plank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Standing Knee-To-Elbow Crunches: &lt;/b&gt;For this move, you’ll lift one knee up to the opposite elbow, activating the side obliques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forearm Plank Hold (or Wall Plank):&lt;/b&gt; This classic exercise is great for building core strength. Feel free to modify it to a wall plank, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Standing core work challenges our core to fight gravity and maintain balance while engaging more stabilizer muscles (hips, pelvic floor, back) for functional stability,” North tells us. “While floor exercises offer more stability to isolate deeper core muscles, making them great for building foundational strength and for beginners, standing movements emulate daily activities better, building functional strength, power, and balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Emphasize form: Prioritizing quality of movement over speed is crucial for preventing injury.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider low-impact options: Opt for wall pushups, marches, or chair-assisted moves, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistency is essential: Aim to perform this seven-minute routine for fat loss and improved health markers, such as insulin sensitivity, on a regular basis.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjrtghn100183b78t1t27er3@published"&gt;My husband and I were out at a restaurant several days ago. Midway through dinner, he took my hand and put it under the table. I felt my eyes get wide as I realized what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjrthq2l00253b783popp7pd@published"&gt;When he put my hand down there, I felt his hard-on, which he had exposed. He then asked me to give him a hand job (fortunately the tablecloth obstructed the view). I wanted to avoid getting caught, so I complied and got him off quickly. When we got to the car he said it was the most thrilling sexual experience he’s had in ages and wants to do it again. Now I’m afraid to go anywhere with him that might afford him the opportunity. What can I do other than refuse to go places where he might try it?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="172" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjrtghxb001b3b78a4gne7cz@published"&gt;It’s completely reasonable for a number of reasons to not want to repeat that, but you don’t specify any in your letter. Just make sure you can articulate exactly why you want to avoid this situation moving forward. “It makes me uncomfortable to engage in public sexual behavior, which could lead to negative consequences,” for example, is more than justified rationale. “It makes me uncomfortable,” is more than justified rationale, period, but it does help to have an explanation to share with one’s partner so that you can be fully understood and so that the conversation about this doesn’t become an ongoing one, with your husband regularly bringing it up/begging you to participate. If you need to take some time to work out exactly what about that you didn’t like, do so. And then get back to him. And if he presses, indeed tell him that you will start to refuse going into public spaces with him. You aren’t into it and you shouldn’t have to do anything that you aren’t into.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjrtgi0i001c3b78rc33xw4d@published"&gt;If there are semi-public alternatives, like a swingers club or sex parties, that you’d be more into, maybe suggest those. I don’t know if they’d fly with him—likely part of the thrill was indeed the risk of getting caught, which means you might be squarely at odds with your husband here. But that’s too bad for him. He wants something, you don’t, your refusal to consent is where this fantasy is blocked from becoming a reality (at least with your participation). Sucks for him, but them’s the breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, she revealed that what she told me about her first marriage had been a complete lie. Worse, to me, she refused to have a rational conversation about it—either together or in therapy. It turns out that rather than one affair with a married man at the end of a nine-year marriage, she had &lt;em&gt;four affairs&lt;/em&gt; with different men across the nine years. I have been shaken to the core. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/second-marriage-husband-wife-relationship-history.html"&gt;How can I trust her?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru012800193b78wdg95iej@published"&gt;I’m a woman with a thing for bisexual men and I have multiple boyfriends at the moment. Two of them frequent the local gay bathhouse but only give and receive oral sex there. I am their only female sex partner.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru015r001a3b781o3puvj0@published"&gt;I am wondering if it’s especially dangerous for me to have unprotected oral and vaginal sex with these men considering the fact that they are giving and receiving unprotected oral with men anonymously. I know that there is always some risk involved, but aside from the virus that causes genital warts, are there any other STIs that I am at high risk for getting?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru019p001b3b7809i4ppci@published"&gt;We do get tested regularly but I don’t know if normal tests would show an infection of the throat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru01k7001e3b7820pngeen@published"&gt;“High risk” is a bit of a fuzzy concept here because of the medical interventions that science and technology have afforded us. Doxy PEP (that is antibiotic therapy taken after potential exposure) reduces the risk of contracting bacterial STIs like syphilis and chlamydia (and, &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/mar-2024/full-analysis-french-sti-study-dashes-hopes-gonorrhoea-vaccine"&gt;perhaps to a lesser degree&lt;/a&gt;, gonorrhea). If your guys are on this, their risk is lowered and yours would be as well. There is little risk of contracting HIV via oral, but PrEP could also potentially help with this, as regular STI testing is part of the regimen. That can catch STIs that are asymptomatic and would have gone otherwise undetected.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru01o7001f3b78ytvnk79a@published"&gt;HPV is certainly a risk, though given your sexual activity, you have likely already been exposed to it (the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-and-cancer"&gt;overwhelming majority&lt;/a&gt; of sexually active people have been). Herpes, too. There are also lesser discussed infections like trichomoniasis, shigella, and giardia (the latter two generally come from anal contact).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru01s0001g3b78rzynaqra@published"&gt;The simple fact is that to some degree, you’re at risk for all of this. So are your partners. Highly sexually active partners may create more opportunities for these infections, but all it takes is one act to contract one (or more). This is the risk you assume when you have sex with someone. Routine testing and the medical interventions described above can help (note that doxy PEP has only been CDC-&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/rr/rr7302a1.htm"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for cis men and trans women). If your STI testing doesn’t include throat and rectal swabs, you can certainly request them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002m3b784mgrwpwa@published"&gt;My wife and I have had only very vanilla sex for our 40+ years of marriage. Very enjoyable, but not as exciting as it used to be. It is pretty much always the same. And I am always the one initiating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002n3b78ad8w9xg2@published"&gt;I have gladly given her oral during our pre-marriage and married years, as I enjoy giving it as much as she enjoys receiving it. However, she has never reciprocated or even asked if I’d like her to do that. I haven’t ever asked her why. I know I should. I’m just afraid of a negative reaction if I ask.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002o3b78m5tihtwb@published"&gt;I have also asked her many times if she has anything different that she would like me to do or for her. Her answer has always been that she is very happy with what we do now. She has never asked me if there is anything that I would like her to me. Ditto to my fear above.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002p3b78c40u04pq@published"&gt;I have two fetishes that I would like my wife to perform. One is to tie up my cock and balls, then jerk me off. The other is to incorporate her smoking a cigarette during our intimacy and foreplay. I have asked her if she would be willing to smoke a cigarette. Her answer was a hard no. I know the tying up of my genitals is a wholly different level of ask.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i4002u3b78gagdi9gb@published"&gt;You are a living embodiment of the quote (sometimes attributed to Madonna) that goes: People don’t get what they want because they don’t ask for it. You have two choices. You can continue to live in fear of rejection and not get what you’re looking for sexually, or you can challenge that fear, ask your wife for what you want, and maybe not get it. More importantly, &lt;em&gt;maybe you will get it&lt;/em&gt;. It’s an uncertain outcome, but if you keep going the way that you are, you will certainly not get the experiences that you seek.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="164" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru14i5002v3b78lt7d90oj@published"&gt;It sounds like you’ve been extremely considerate toward your wife, to the point of over-politeness. Hold onto that love and compassion, and extend some to yourself. Your wife turned down your request to smoke a cigarette during sex, and while I understand what you mean about tying up your genitals being “a wholly different level of ask,” life isn’t a video game. There isn’t an A to B progression when it comes to sex acts. There isn’t always logic to apply to what people are and aren’t into. On top of that, there are reasons to refrain from smoking a cigarette that have nothing to do with sex—maybe your wife doesn’t like the smell or how cigarettes make her feel. Maybe she just finds cigarettes generally disgusting. I can relate to this way of thinking—I would put just about any penis in my mouth before I would put a cigarette in it. As you can surmise, I’m not a prude; I just loathe cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask her about oral. See if she will allow you to engage her in what are sometimes difficult or uncomfortable conversations. It sounds like she is entirely satisfied with your sex life, which is a wonderful thing. Emphasize that you have found it very enjoyable as well—so enjoyable that you’d like to explore a bit more with her, since she’s been such a wonderful partner. She may turn you down entirely, which is her right, but if you keep things kind and positive, she will be way more likely to at least hear you out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3auh004c3b78ykoc63vz@published"&gt;I had prostate surgery three years ago and have still not been able to get back to my normal sex life. Before prostate cancer, my wife and I had sex three to five times a week. Sometimes it was quickies; other times it was longer play. We are both in our 60s.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004d3b78f15cl9im@published"&gt;The doctor has prescribed pills and pumps and cock rings, but they don’t sustain my erection long enough to satisfy my wife.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="58" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004e3b78adqueefc@published"&gt;My question is this: When we travel to Europe, I can’t take Trimix with me. It has to stay refrigerated and you have to declare it, making for an embarrassing discussion at customs. I am wondering if a penis sleeve that could go over my flaccid cock but be rigid enough for sex, including anal, is a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004f3b78vb6lwtfe@published"&gt;The internet is full of dildo-style toys, but I’m looking for something more specific. Any advice would be appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="6" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004g3b78j68np8fw@published"&gt;—To Sleeve or Not to Sleeve&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004h3b78b8h1filu@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear To Sleeve or Not to Sleeve,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004i3b78yltyilds@published"&gt;Congrats on finding a solution for you—post-prostatectomy sex can be very difficult to navigate. It’s generally not a topic of mainstream conversation, and though many options exist, not all work for everyone, as you know well. But you found a way. The good news is that even if you were to find no suitable alternative for your trip to Europe, that trip is only temporary and you will soon return home to your Trimix, which you don’t have to discuss with anyone (though I’m assuming your wife is aware). The problem here will resolve even without the solution that your letter seeks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004j3b78u455357x@published"&gt;I think a sleeve is definitely worth a try. These range in price. You could get a relatively inexpensive one like &lt;a href="https://www.adameve.com/adult-sex-toys/penis-enhancers/sp-adams-extension-by-adam-eve-89865.aspx"&gt;Adam’s Extension&lt;/a&gt;, which has nubs outside (for her) and inside (which may provide stimulation to you). Higher end ones like &lt;a href="https://rxsleeve.com/collections/penis-sleeves"&gt;those from RX Sleeve&lt;/a&gt; could set you back a few hundred or even more, depending on your desired level of &lt;a href="https://rxsleeve.com/pages/custom"&gt;customization&lt;/a&gt;. (With that brand specifically, there is a chance of &lt;a href="https://rxsleeve.com/pages/insurance"&gt;insurance reimbursement&lt;/a&gt;.) Keep in mind that the data on these is not robust, but the authors of the 2017 paper “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5715194/"&gt;Non-pharmacological and non-surgical strategies to promote sexual recovery for men with erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;” did not consider that to be invalidating. “Studies on these aids are admittedly sparse and mostly anecdotal, but that should not preclude considering them as therapeutic options,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004k3b78hsbcmtsy@published"&gt;Another option in that paper that you might want to consider is &lt;a href="https://www.theelator.com/pages/how-to-attach"&gt;The Elator&lt;/a&gt;, an “external penile support device.” This allows penetration without an erection via a rod that runs along the bottom of the penis that’s attached via rings at the base and around the head. The price point is in the $300 range. There is also the option of a strap-on, which is typically a dildo connected to your body via harness. Typically, the penis does not go into the penetrating object (unlike a sleeve, though the RX Sleeve also attaches via harness).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3aui004l3b78shlk826y@published"&gt;“What’s the point?” you may be asking, but according to the authors of the above cited paper, “case reports indicate that an external prosthesis, when incorporated in penetrative sex, may recreate the sensory experience of coital sex without the patient needing the penile rigidity for intercourse.” Your partner could play with your penis while you penetrate her with the dildo, but also the entire experience could get you in the headspace of penetrative sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3auj004m3b78gsh2ro3b@published"&gt;So say the authors:&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmjru3xut005b3b7887ji0i39@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="75"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For men who are adventurous and attuned to the totality of sensory stimulation during sex, the sensory experience achieved during intercourse with an external penile prosthesis may closely match the sensory experience of normal coitus and lead to orgasm. Use of the prosthesis can empower patients who accept the prosthesis as part of themselves, much the same way that well-adapted wheel-chair dependent patients come to accept their chair as an extension of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjru3auj004o3b78ux2fy69h@published"&gt;I find that fascinating. Maybe you will, too. The paper is well worth reading, as the benefits of these non-medical ED options are well articulated and it may also give you more ideas. For example, the authors stress the importance of including your partner in selecting and using these devices (setting them up/putting them into place may be a form of foreplay). They write:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmjru4aje005l3b786nmj2xqg@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="74"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Involving partners in such activities can build intimacy in a broad sense, even when the aids do not restore full erection. This is predicated on the fact that intimacy can be considered as something a couple shares with each other and no one else. While penetrative sex may be considered archetypal intimate act, a simple activity of shopping together for sex aids is still an intimate act that can thus strengthen co-supportive spousal/partner bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Berberine (from plants such as &lt;em&gt;Berberis&lt;/em&gt;) has &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-long-does-it-take-for-berberine-to-lower-your-blood-sugar-11788249" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar (glucose)-lowering effects&lt;/a&gt; and is sometimes used as a “natural” alternative to metformin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies and reviews have shown similar mechanisms between berberine and metformin. For example, both can help reduce the amount of glucose produced by your liver.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This can lead to additive or synergistic effects when taken together, so your blood sugar may drop too low. The similar effects also mean that GI side effects can be worsened.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Talk to your healthcare provider before planning to take berberine. If you are also taking metformin or another glucose-lowering medication, you may need to closely monitor your blood sugar levels and review your dosing with your provider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-cinnamon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Cinnamon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon can increase the risk of low blood sugar when combined with medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cinnamon and cinnamon extracts have been reported in multiple trials and reviews to modestly lower fasting glucose and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/a1c-chart-8631159" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hemoglobin A1c&lt;/a&gt; (average blood sugar level over two or three months) in some people.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This effect means that cinnamon supplements can enhance the glucose-lowering effect of prescription medications, such as sulfonylureas or insulin, especially when taken in concentrated form rather than as a sprinkle of the spice. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Clinical evidence is mixed, but caution is warranted. "Natural” doesn’t mean harmless, and you should check your blood glucose more often if you start taking a cinnamon supplement.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-ginseng"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Ginseng &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unpredictable effects mean ginseng may increase or decrease the effect of prescription diabetes medications.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Different ginseng preparations (e.g., American, Asian) and study designs produce inconsistent results, but studies show that ginseng can affect insulin secretion, glucose uptake, and postprandial (after a meal) glucose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In individuals already taking oral blood sugar-lowering drugs or insulin, ginseng may have the potential to cause additive glucose-lowering effects, which can lead to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hypoglycemia-symptoms-1298883" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;hypoglycemia (too low blood sugar),&lt;/a&gt; or alter their responses to these medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Commercial ginseng products can vary widely in potency and formulation. Be sure to consult with your healthcare provider before starting this supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-st-johns-wort"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. St. John's Wort &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; St. John's wort may change drug metabolism, affecting how much of your diabetes medications get absorbed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-st-johns-wort-7556278" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;St. John’s wort&lt;/a&gt; increases the activity of CYP3A4 (a drug-metabolizing enzyme in the body) and certain drug transporters (proteins responsible for drug absorption, distribution, and elimination). As a result, it can reduce the blood levels of medications that share these pathways. For this reason, it is notorious for interacting with many different medications. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/medications-for-type-2-diabetes-7642774" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes drugs&lt;/a&gt; do not get broken down by the CYP3A4 enzyme, St. John’s wort has been shown to alter the way metformin works in your body in at least one trial. It can also interact with many other medications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because of its unpredictability with interactions, it's recommended to avoid combining St. John’s wort with complex medication regimens without supervision from your healthcare provider.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-aloe-vera"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Aloe Vera &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aloe vera can lower glucose and interact with diabetes medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aloe vera has been studied for its effects on processes that contribute to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/hyperglycemia-symptoms-and-signs-11852484" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. Studies suggest that it may be beneficial in reducing fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, particularly in stabilizing blood sugar levels after meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the extent to which aloe vera affects blood sugar levels is unknown. Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking an aloe vera supplement. Keep in mind that aloe vera formulations also vary, and some can cause side effects, such as GI upset.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/chromium-benefits-4588421" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chromium supplementation&lt;/a&gt; has shown modest improvements in &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/chromium-benefits-4588421" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; and hemoglobin A1c in some studies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Other studies have shown benefit only in people with poor nutritional status or already low chromium levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because chromium can enhance insulin action, using it with a prescription blood sugar-lowering drug can raise the risk of hypoglycemia, especially if the doses are higher than those found in multivitamins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Institute of Medicine, it is safe when taken at a dose of 200 micrograms daily for up to six months.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind, chromium supplements may also carry side effect risks like GI upset or headaches. Caution should be used if you have kidney or liver issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Talk to your healthcare provider about whether chromium supplements may be beneficial for you.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was released during October's ADHD Awareness Month, which this year highlights "the many faces of ADHD." Scientists from the University of Bath, King's College London, and Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands collaborated on the first large-scale effort to measure psychological strengths associated with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Study Compares Strengths in Adults With and Without ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in Psychological Medicine, the study examined 200 adults diagnosed with ADHD and 200 adults without ADHD. Participants were asked how strongly they identified with 25 positive traits, including creativity, humor, spontaneity and hyperfocus. Researchers defined these traits as "things [they] do well or best."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD is commonly discussed in terms of difficulties such as impulsivity, forgetfulness, and trouble sustaining attention. This study points to a different perspective by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and making use of strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luca Hargitai, lead researcher from the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, said: "These exciting findings give us an indication of which positive qualities may be tied to ADHD and thus can be considered ADHD-related strengths. It can be really empowering to recognise that, while ADHD is associated with various difficulties, it does have several positive aspects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Strengths More Commonly Endorsed by Adults With ADHD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with participants without ADHD, those with ADHD were more likely to strongly identify with 10 specific strengths. These included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Hyperfocus (deep concentration on tasks of interest)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Humor&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Creativity&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Spontaneity&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Intuitiveness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the well-documented challenges adults with ADHD often face in work, relationships, and mental health, the study found they were just as likely as neurotypical participants to recognize and use their strengths in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Strengths Tied to Better Mental Health Across Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across both groups, individuals who had greater awareness of their strengths and applied them more frequently reported clear benefits. These included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Higher subjective well-being&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Better quality of life (across physical, psychological, social and environmental domains)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Fewer symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Punit Shah, senior author and Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Bath, said: "Our findings highlight that knowing that we have certain skills and positive qualities at our disposal and using these strengths where appropriate can be beneficial for our well-being. This might sound obvious, but now that our research confirms this hypothesis, we can start designing psychological supports with this fresh evidence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Strengths-Based Approaches in ADHD Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results add weight to strengths-based approaches in mental health care. While this framework is increasingly used in autism services, it has received far less attention in ADHD. Potential applications include psychoeducational programs, coaching, and customized therapies that help people identify and apply their strengths more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shah added: "The next step now is to investigate whether interventions that promote the recognition and use of personal strengths can offer tangible improvements in mental wellbeing for adults with ADHD. People with ADHD and other neurodivergences have been calling for this for a long time and we are excited to have some of the first research to support this."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Comparing ADHD and Neurotypical Strengths Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior author Assistant Professor Martine Hoogman of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands emphasized that research into ADHD-related strengths is still developing. She noted that many previous studies focused only on people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Research on ADHD-related strengths is still in its early stages. Most studies ask only people with ADHD about their strengths, but we also asked neurotypical people. We found that people without ADHD recognise many of the same strengths, though only those with ADHD endorse some of them. This helps us better understand ADHD strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's important to educate people with ADHD not just about challenges, but also about their potential strengths to improve quality of life and reduce risks in work or education."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by funding from the UK Economic and Social Research Council and the Dutch Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The U.S. research enterprise has been scrambled by a series of political decisions with long-reaching consequences. But make no mistake: Science didn’t stop, and medicine has had its share of major advances.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I have written for years, this is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/11/03/why-were-not-prepared-for-next-wave-of-biotech-innovation/"&gt;biology’s century&lt;/a&gt; — a period of unprecedented advancement in medical science driven by an explosion of data, an unprecedented level of biological understanding, and a flood of private-sector money. What makes 2025 unique is that these advances, from an innovation in biotech that saved a baby with an ultra-rare disease to the arrival of a potent new weapon in the war on HIV, came against the backdrop of government decisions that will limit even the most promising science in the future. Here is a look at what 2025 brought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-gene-edit-and-a-baby"&gt;A gene edit and a baby&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ask anyone in biotech for the defining moment of medical innovation this year, and they’ll point you to KJ Muldoon. When he was just 6 months old, the genes of cells in KJ’s liver were &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/15/crispr-gene-editing-landmark-first-ever-single-patient-genetic-fix-nejm-reports/"&gt;edited using CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; — the technology that won researchers the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020 — to correct a unique mutation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The treatment did not cure KJ, but it allowed him to resume a normal diet and means he is no longer facing the liver transplant that he likely would have needed otherwise. What was striking about the case was that KJ’s treatment had been developed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania on a one-off basis. The question now is whether — and how — the medical system can adapt to make more cases like this possible. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Regulators have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/12/fda-roadmap-how-to-scale-baby-kj-custom-gene-editing-treatment/"&gt;moved to lower barriers&lt;/a&gt; for the development of these “n of 1” treatments, but there is no commercial model to encourage them. The only approved gene-editing treatment, for sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia, is used to treat a larger population and still has a list price of more than $2 million. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-strong-crop-of-new-medicines"&gt;A strong crop of new medicines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has approved 44 brand new drugs this year, down six from a year ago but still a bumper crop — and more than twice as many as were approved in 2010, when the pharmaceutical industry saw itself facing an innovation crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most new medicines are incremental advances, but every year a few stand out for either their immediate impact or their potential. Here are some that meet those criteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeztugo&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Gilead’s long-acting medicine for the prevention of HIV infection is the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/18/fda-approves-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir-yeztugo-next-best-thing-to-vaccine/"&gt;closest thing yet to a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; against the disease. The Trump administration’s dismantling of USAID and cuts to other HIV-prevention programs could blunt its impact, but deals Gilead has made with generics makers could still lead to broad distribution. An agreement with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria could provide the drug to 2 million people in resource-limited countries over three years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Journavx&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;A non-opioid painkiller developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/vertex-pain-drug-journavx-wins-fda-approval-non-opioid/"&gt;approved at the start of the year&lt;/a&gt;. There are questions about how effective it is, but if patients, doctors, hospitals, and insurers embrace it, Journavx could spare some people from being exposed to addictive treatments. It’s one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New antibiotics: Two new antibiotics were approved to treat gonorrhea. Nuzolvence was produced by the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/17/zoliflodacin-gonorrhea-gardp-innoviva-antibiotic-resistance/"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; of Innoviva Specialty Therapeutics and the Global Antibiotic Research &amp;amp; Development Partnership, and Blujepa by GSK. That’s important because even as bacteria have become more resistant to common antibiotics, antibiotic drug development has been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2025/05/07/antibiotics-antimicrobial-pharma-biotech-medicines/"&gt;stymied by scientific and commercial challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-progress-against-cancer"&gt;Progress against cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is not a single drug that changes everything, but advances that add up one after another. Take lung cancer, for instance, for which the FDA in 2025 approved five new drugs targeting different subtypes of the disease. They are among a broader group of targeted medicines that have in recent years extended the lives of patients with metastatic disease.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Among new approvals, for instance, was one for the combination of Rybrevant and Lazcluze, from Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, which was shown to extend the time before tumors grow significantly in non-small cell lung cancer caused by a mutation in the gene EGFR. So did the targeted therapy Tagrisso, from AstraZeneca, when given with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other advances register here, too. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/02/enhertu-breast-cancer-astrazeneca-daiichi-sankyo/"&gt;Enhertu&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/10/24/with-an-old-approach-but-new-energy-adcs-take-center-stage-as-promising-cancer-treatments/"&gt;antibody-drug conjugate&lt;/a&gt;, which combines a genetically targeted therapy with a chemotherapeutic warhead in a single molecule, became the new standard of care for patients’ whose tumors test positive for a protein called HER2 when added to an existing drug, Perjeta. Adding Enhertu delayed tumor progression by a median seven months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-vaccines-delivering-more-for-less"&gt;Vaccines delivering more for less&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated against shingles is already important; it is, quite simply, a painful disease no one wants. But there is building evidence of another reason: The herpes zoster virus that causes shingles may also contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s. A study published using data in Wales, where there was a specific birthdate cut-off for getting a shingles vaccine, helped&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; back up this idea.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another example of a vaccine doing more than was intended: HPV vaccinations have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/hpv-vaccine-prevent-cervical-cancer-cervarix-gardasil-study/"&gt;nearly eliminated cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; in some countries, and can also prevent head and neck cancer. Emerging data say the vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/28/hpv-vaccine-single-dose-prevents-infection-just-as-well-as-two-doses-hci-clinical-trial/"&gt;may work well as one dose, instead of two&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear whether the U.S. will move in that direction, but the news could be a big deal in areas where vaccines are in short supply.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-glp-1-pills"&gt;The GLP-1 pills&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 agonists — weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound — are changing society’s health and our culture. In December, a higher dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, was approved for weight loss (and the reduction of cardiovascular risks) &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/22/wegovy-pill-oral-weight-loss-treatment-approved/"&gt;as a pill instead of an injection&lt;/a&gt;. The drug was developed by Novo Nordisk. In some ways, it’s a small thing; Novo previously had a GLP-1 pill approved to treat type 2 diabetes. But another new such pill is coming soon from Eli Lilly, and the availability of these medicines will be one more way that they reshape the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-watch"&gt;What to watch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There was also some more futuristic progress afoot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new gene therapy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/24/huntingtons-gene-therapy-uniqure/"&gt;showed promise in Huntington’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, although it seems to have &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/03/huntingtons-disease-fda-update-uniqure/"&gt;run into hurdles at the FDA&lt;/a&gt; and full data have not yet been presented.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have made significant progress in creating genetically engineered pigs whose organs can be transplanted into people, potentially alleviating the organ shortage. Work is moving forward with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/08/pig-organ-transplant-egenesis-revivicor-human-trials-fda/"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/25/first-lung-xenotransplant-gene-edited-pig/"&gt;gene-edited lung&lt;/a&gt; was transplanted into a brain-dead patient as a first step toward trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest hurdles in biotechnology is that so much progress relies exclusively on companies. It was heartening, then, that an Italian nonprofit was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/10/nonprofit-telethon-wins-fda-approval-gene-therapy-waskyra/"&gt;able to bring a gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; to market successfully. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping for more breakthroughs in 2026 — and smoother sailing for medical science writ large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

is that this mystery virus shouldn't keep you out for too long, although some symptoms can linger for up to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Ian Budd, lead prescribing pharmacist at &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.chemist-4-u.com/cold-flu"&gt;Chemist4U&lt;/a&gt;, has explained what is most likely going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Adenovirus is a highly contagious flu-like virus (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"What we’re seeing in the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;, often called a ‘mystery virus’ or a fast-spreading throat/respiratory bug, lines up with what clinicians and public &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; bodies are seeing: adenovirus, a group of common respiratory viruses that circulate widely," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an adenovirus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://publichealthscotland.scot/population-health/health-protection/infectious-diseases/adenovirus/overview/symptoms/"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; Public Health Scotland, adenoviruses 'can cause a wide range of illnesses such as common cold or flu-like symptoms'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Although human disease may often be mild or moderate, it can be severe especially when untreated in elderly or immunocompromised individuals," the health service notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While these viruses 'aren’t new', Budd says that 'more people are noticing symptoms and heading to their GP'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between an adenovirus and a cold or flu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Compared to a cold, adenovirus can be more likely to cause fever and conjunctivitis, and symptoms can last longer," Budd explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;It's currently spreading across the UK (Getty Stock Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The difference with flu, however, is that there is currently no vaccine for adenovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Due to the cold, more people are getting ill because they're spending more time indoors and are in closer proximity to people who might be carrying a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Budd explained: "With COVID-19 restrictions lifted and fewer people catching other viruses over the past few years, immunity in the community may be lower, leading to people becoming more susceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Adenovirus isn’t a new virus;

with much of the world with no evidence for benefit. The announcement has been postponed until the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead of Vinay Prasad, the top vaccines chief, Høeg is listed to speak at the event. She was recently named acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the fifth person to lead the center this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The acting appointment of Høeg could signify a closer partnership between the drug and vaccine centers as Høeg and Prasad consolidate power at the agency – and it signals a greater focus upon dismantling already-approved vaccines at the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg has frequently advocated for ending some childhood vaccine recommendations in the US in order to be more similar to Denmark, a nation with universal health coverage and a population roughly the size of Wisconsin’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So far in public appearances, she has continued to focus on vaccines – typically the purview of Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) – rather than drug regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg’s predecessors reportedly clashed with Prasad when he attempted to pull drug-regulatory employees into vaccine-regulation work, but Høeg and Prasad have worked together closely both at the FDA and by co-authoring research in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg has no apparent experience in drug development, regulation or management, which has been typical for past directors of the CBER. She has worked at the FDA as a senior adviser to the commissioner, Marty Makary, and CBER since March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She doesn’t seem to have any of the qualifications” for running the drug-regulation department, said Jonathan Howard, a neurologist and psychiatrist who has closely tracked Covid contrarians, including in his new book, Everyone Else Is Lying to You. “She’s never run a randomized controlled trial. She has no expertise leading a large organization. She has no expertise in industry regulation or drug approvals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Past directors of CBER would “understand laws and regulations and the science of drug development”, said Janet Woodcock, former acting FDA commissioner and former CBER director. “Objectively, she doesn’t have the kind of background that previous people who ran CBER have had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The drug center has an enormous portfolio at FDA, Woodcock pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Everybody just pays attention to the new drug program, but the generic program approves thousands of generic drugs. There’s a biosimilars program, over-the-counter program and so forth, and all of those have to be looked after,” Woodcock said. “The thing you don’t keep your eye on, that’s the thing that I always told people is going to bite you in the behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is also a significant leadership component to the position, which oversees more than 5,000 employees. “It’s a huge management job, if you do it right,” Woodcock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In response to the Guardian’s questions about Høeg’s qualifications and whether this appointment signifies greater collaboration among FDA leaders on vaccines, the “questions rely on incorrect assumptions”, said Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This background aligns with the responsibilities of her role,” Hilliard said, pointing to the months Høeg spent advising the FDA commissioner on “drug safety and regulatory science, including computational safety modeling and vaccine surveillance”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As acting director, Høeg inherits the commissioner’s new priority voucher program, a controversial one-day drug-approval program that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/15/fda-us-healthcare" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/03/fda-drug-chief-signals-retires-pazdur" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;troubled&lt;/a&gt; her predecessors, Richard Pazdur and George Tidmarsh. “How are these drugs being chosen for this voucher program? Who makes the decisions?” Howard said. “There’s a lot of secrecy going on at the FDA right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, he said, “the FDA seems to be moving towards laxer regulations of all drugs, except for vaccines”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With vaccines, Høeg has a more established, if troubling, track record, Howard said. She published a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13759" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; using unconfirmed crowd-sourced reports to determine the rate of heart inflammation after Covid vaccination. She advised the Florida surgeon general Joseph Ladapo, who reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/24/florida-surgeon-general-covid-vaccine-00093510" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;altered data&lt;/a&gt; to suggest Covid vaccines are more dangerous than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Part of her “wish list” for the new Trump administration included changing regulations for new vaccines and ending “unnecessary” vaccines, she &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctor-with-wish-list-more-vaccine-scrutiny-named-assistant-new-fda-chief-2025-04-02/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; after the election on a podcast with Christine Stabell Benn, one of the Danish researchers who recently received a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/19/hepatitis-b-vaccine-study-guinea-bissau-rfk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;controversial CDC grant&lt;/a&gt; to study hepatitis B vaccines in Guinea-Bissau. At the FDA, Høeg has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/12/fda-vaccine-policy-controlled-by-vinay-prasad-tracy-beth-hoeg/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; excluding young men from getting Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She’s an all-around ideologue who starts off with her conclusions and works backwards to retrofit the evidence in a very disingenuous, dishonest way,” Howard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg joined other contrarians, like Marty Makary, Vinay Prasad and Jay Bhattacharya, in sharply criticizing the handling of the Covid pandemic, particularly vaccination; they’ve all been given high-profile positions in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“They’re totally consolidating power, these Covid contrarians,” Howard said. “Everything that’s happening now is a direct consequence of rage and anger over Covid mitigations. These people are furious – livid that their genius wasn’t acknowledged. So they’re on kind of a revenge tour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the pandemic, the contrarians were like “armchair quarterbacks”, Woodcock said. “The problem with that is, they think they can play the game. They can’t play the game. They’ve never played the game, they just criticized every play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Raymond Pollak, an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) adviser and transplant surgeon, pointed out that “our patient population in the United States is very different culturally” from Høeg’s homeland of Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Denmark &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/19/denmark-vaccine-schedule-vs-us/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;does not&lt;/a&gt; routinely vaccinate against hepatitis B (at birth), chickenpox, influenza, rotavirus, hepatitis A, meningococcal disease or RSV. As a result, there are tens of thousands of vaccine-preventable diseases each year in Denmark, a nation of 6 million people – less than the population of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are other major differences as well. Prenatal care is free for all in Denmark, and the country has a national health registry. More than 95% of pregnant women in Denmark are screened for hepatitis B, and pregnant people who test positive – and their babies – are monitored to ensure that they are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In comparison, each year, 500,000 pregnant people in the US are never tested for hepatitis B, and many infants born to positive or status-unknown parents are lost to follow-up as soon as they leave the hospital, said Adam Langer, acting principal deputy director and associate director for science at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And the US has different disease patterns and risks compared with most other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The United States is a unique country. I think that most of us would agree that we don’t really have a peer nation in this world,” Langer said at an ACIP meeting earlier this month. The closest might be Canada, he said – and they are moving toward the same birth dose recommendations the US just jettisoned. “So let’s talk about apples to apples, not apples to oranges,” Langer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet Høeg cast doubt on the evidence behind hepatitis B vaccination, stating that “from a regulatory perspective” officials in the second Trump administration “have a very low level of confidence” in saying that these benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks, while presenting no new evidence of risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg also featured several anti-vaccine talking points in her comments during a presentation she made on the Danish vaccination schedules to the ACIP. When discussing the number of vaccines a child receives in the US, Høeg questioned the amount of aluminum in each shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I do not feel like we have the data to show that there is an established safe amount that children can receive before the age of two, before the age of 18,” she said, and she also doubted the data on the effects of giving multiple vaccines concurrently. Aluminum adjuvants help vaccines work effectively and have been &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-074874/205757/The-Role-and-Safety-of-Aluminum-Adjuvants-in?autologincheck=redirected" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shown to be safe&lt;/a&gt;, and it is safe to give multiple vaccines at once, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/multiples.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Høeg also took aim at the RSV shots that have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/18/rsv-cases-decline-vaccines-treatment" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dramatically reduced&lt;/a&gt; hospitalization among US babies, claiming that in the trials there was a higher death rate, though she admitted it was “not quite statistically significant”. No such safety signals have been announced in the rollout of RSV shots over the past several years, but the FDA is still &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/10/rsv-shots-vaccines-rfk-hhs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;launching an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into their safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In December, 12 former commissioners of the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMp2517497" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;penned&lt;/a&gt; a warning in the New England Journal of Medicine about the lack of transparency in announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/11/fda-vaccine-regulations-unconfirmed-covid-deaths" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new changes&lt;/a&gt; to vaccine regulations. In the past, regulatory officials were rigorous about documenting benefits and harms based on publicly available evidence, said Woodcock, one of the signatories to the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The commissioners are writing because that is not the process that has been followed, and it’s not generally a scientific process of open debate,” Woodcock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You can just make decisions because you have the pen and say: ‘It’s because I said so.’ But that doesn’t lead to, over time, a lot of trust in the system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxONVpzWG0xMi1JRUsySTJrTk5lUDRQZVlISTVQdXFrU2NZbUJuSGZGYU1pUUlzOFVmMDNSOHhzOUE2M09hdkNmdmd4N2pTZmNPdGJRcWNPdWVKaWlyWURiY2tMTHZ6bFhLOWItcFNBOUF1bkhDaDVVWjVGek9UQ0puZVln</guid></item><item><title>1月份由营养师制定的31天地中海饮食计划- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/31-day-mediterranean-diet-meal-plan-for-more-energy-in-january-11865930</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7527550/you-just-started-the-mediterranean-diet-here-are-the-recipes-to-make-first/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 368 to 584 calories while the lunches span 359 to 505 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re feeling sluggish, there may be several factors at play. Taking a look at your sleep habits, nutrition routine and hydration status are good first steps. Focusing on good &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7527638/how-to-sleep-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; hygiene and getting enough hours per night, eating regular meals with protein and fiber, getting enough physical activity and drinking plenty of water are all strategies to increase your energy. If you’re still feeling low energy, reach out to your medical provider as fatigue can be a symptom of many underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_787-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290484/why-the-mediterranean-diet-is-so-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is routinely named one of the healthiest eating patterns.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It emphasizes a high intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, nuts, seeds and whole grains while limiting refined grains and added sugars. Though it was initially named after the eating patterns observed by some of the countries that border the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8046714/a-new-mediterranean-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Mediterranean Sea&lt;/a&gt;, it’s important to note that this is a vast region consisting of a variety of cuisines and cultures. With its emphasis on eating more produce and healthy fats as well as cooking more meals at home and limiting processed foods, this healthy eating pattern is adaptable to a wide array of cuisines. With its emphasis on cooking more meals at home and eating plenty of produce, fiber-rich legumes, whole grains and healthy fats, it’s no surprise that this eating style has numerous health benefits. Research links the Mediterranean diet to lower rates of obesity, improved heart health and a reduced risk of chronic disease.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though the Mediterranean diet limits added sugars and refined grains, it’s not restrictive, meaning it’s more likely to be adapted as a lifestyle change than a short-term diet. &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;To follow the Mediterranean diet, focus on foods you could be adding to your routine instead of trying to avoid certain foods. Aim to include more vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts, legumes, whole grains and legumes into your meals to reap the benefits. No restrictive resolutions here!

Scientific research has repeatedly shown that the simple, ancient human habit of taking step after step can help you lose weight, raise your metabolism, strengthen your heart and lungs, and galvanise your bones, joints and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can help to prevent dementia, Type 2 diabetes, some cancers and heart disease. And it’s available to all: according to Harvard researchers, it can even counteract weight gain in people born with weight-promoting genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking has been shown to boost mood, reduce anxiety and enhance sleep. It can even cut cravings for sugary foods, reduce your number of sick days and boost your creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), believes walking is “the closest thing we have to a wonder drug”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the benefits of walking stem from the physical motion involved, which burns calories, lubricates joints and muscles, boosts blood flow and fortifies bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other rewards are derived from the mental freedom and perspective it yields. Further health gains originate from the simple act of injecting more movement and mobility into your day. But, together, the results are astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why global health bodies universally encourage us to start ambling, strolling, plodding, hiking, trekking or rambling over pavements, grass, mud or beaches, through forests or fields or on whirring treadmills – however, wherever and whenever we can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where does the 10,000 steps goal come from?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/12/10000-steps-2.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-953007"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The 10,000 steps a day target has its origins in the run-up to the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the specific health goal of 10,000 steps a day has become baked into the public consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there is some science to back up the figure. Studies published by the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/em&gt; found that walking 10,000 steps a day is linked to a lower risk of heart disease, cancer and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2016 research paper found walking 10,000 steps per day can lower body fat percentage, reduce anxiety, depression and fatigue, and boost mood after only 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a far more nuanced picture is now emerging. While 10,000 steps a day is a healthy target to aim for, it seems this figure is somewhat arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might guess from the catchy number, it originated as a marketing slogan. In the run-up to the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the Yamasa Corporation, which manufactured industrial instruments and special watches, came up with an early-generation wearable pedometer called a Manpo-Kei, which translates as the “10,000 steps meter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where this step target came from, nobody knows. Some have suggested it may have been chosen because the Japanese character for 10,000 looks like a man running or walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the 10,000 steps target appears to be an educated, albeit arbitrary figure to aim for, later research by Dr Yoshiro Hatano, an academic at Kyushu University of Health and Welfare, found 10,000 steps a day was indeed a good target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found that people who took 10,000 steps could achieve a sustainable calorie burn of 300 calories per day, which research had suggested offered a protective effect against heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t until the huge boom in wearable technology in the 2000s that the figure spread around the world, with the World Health Organisation and other health bodies adopting the 10,000 steps goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure is so ingrained into our health consciousness it is usually the default setting in wearable fitness trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is some reasonable science to back up this target, most studies are based on a rather simplistic comparison between people who take 10,000 steps a day and those who reach far lower numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, people who take 10,000 steps tend to be fitter and healthier. But in recent years, researchers have taken a more forensic approach to the issue, and the results have been revealing. Here are the five key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7,500 steps is the sweet spot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research by Harvard Medical School has revealed that, even though mortality rates improve with the more daily steps you take, the benefits level off after around 7,500 steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any more, such as the magical 10,000 figure, will burn more calories and keep you fit. But 7,500 steps is enough if you want to live longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even taking 4,400 daily steps is associated with a huge 41% reduction in mortality. But you can reap the most benefits from 7,500 steps a day – 25% fewer than the 10,000-step target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is still no universally agreed figure in the research community. A major global study, by the Medical University of Lodz and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, which analysed 226,000 people, showed 4,000 steps is enough to reduce the risk of dying prematurely, while just over 2,300 steps is enough to start benefitting the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the more steps you take, the more you gain. Every 1,000 daily steps beyond 4,000 reduces your risk of dying early by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;, involving 111,000 people, found the health benefits begin at around 2,600 steps per day, but they plateau at around 8,800 steps per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while there is no hard number to aim for, the evidence now suggests 7,500-8,800 steps per day is a more solid marker to target. Taking at least 2,300 steps will still help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And 10,000 or above is still potent if you enjoy walking or want to &lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-cycling"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. But you can enjoy a beautiful spectrum of health benefits from the 7,500-8,800 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Walk faster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/12/10000-steps-3-1.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-953012"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Adding speed and purpose to your walking is better for long-term health. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has injected an interesting new dimension into the steps debate. It seems the pace of your walks is also an important factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brisk, purposeful 4mph seems best. A huge study of 475,000 people by the University of Leicester found that women who walk briskly, at over 4mph, enjoy a life-expectancy boost of up to 15 years over those who move at less than 3mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For men, the life expectancy boost was even higher – around 20 years. Experts don’t know if this is because walking faster is better for the heart and lungs, or if it is just a general reflection of existing good health. But picking up the pace on your daily walks seems to offer a powerful health upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Move more during the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting a certain number of steps per day is a good idea, because quantifying exercise boosts your motivation and commitment. But when and how you take those steps is important, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that to counter the impact of a sedentary modern lifestyle, it is vital to achieve more movement throughout the day. Most of us spend 50-70% of our time sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long periods of sitting are associated with a 90% increase in the risk of death from &lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/health/how-to-navigate-heart-condition-diagnosis"&gt;heart problems&lt;/a&gt; and a 49% increase in the overall risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But staying active throughout the day helps to counter those risks. Research suggests that even regular strolls – around the office or in the park at lunchtime – can protect against the harmful effects of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study showed that short 10-minute walks reverse the vascular dysfunction – such as reduced blood flow and increased stress on the artery walls – caused by sedentary jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A global team of scientists found that doing only three minutes of moderate exercise for each hour of the day you spend sitting down can cut your chance of an early death by 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, adding these micro-bursts of movement during the working day can help to counter the effects of a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Add in some HIIT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking offers a spectacular all-round health boost, but there are some things other forms of exercise are better for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to raise your heart rate in order to further strengthen your cardiovascular system and lung performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose runs, bike rides or fitness classes, the best intensity to aim for is 85-95% of your maximum heart rate – enough to make you feel out of breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major review in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found &lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/hiit-interval-training"&gt;high-intensity interval training&lt;/a&gt; – short bursts of 30-second or 1-minute efforts at 85-95% of your maximum heart rate – significantly improve maximal oxygen uptake, diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, waist circumference, body fat percentage, resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, enjoy your walks, but make sure you add in two or three harder workouts per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lift weights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/12/10000-steps-4.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-953010"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Adding high intensity to your activities raises your heart rate and boosts health in so many ways. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to your walks, it is important to do resistance training. Lean muscle mass deteriorates with age (a process known as sarcopenia). However, &lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/strength-training-cycling"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; – whether lifting dumbbells or completing bodyweight drills – has been shown to improve muscle mass, burn abdominal fat, boost metabolism, enhance balance and mobility, reduce inflammation and improve bone health – all vital supplements to your daily walking regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by Penn State College of Medicine found adults who do strength training twice a week have a 46% lower risk of death from any cause. And a study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Bone and Mineral Research &lt;/em&gt;found that two resistance training sessions per week is enough to protect your bone density and muscle mass as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking truly is a magical elixir for good health. And it should be the foundation stone of any healthy lifestyle. But whatever daily steps target you aim for, don’t forget to take a few extra steps to protect your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BikeRadar</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1nOTlicnJDVHJUbG9iUGtCdE85RF9hSV9Ld2pwdW9kT2VpXy1IMWxyRWhwSWhXZUpTTFVZcndkei03a3ZmcUZXVFBiT2NQNEpCSEZWZ2h2OG9lZWI0WHR3TU9nS0tHQjNUQXpmUW1fUjZrZw</guid></item><item><title>随着流感病例的增加，家庭流感检测的注意事项- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/amid-rise-flu-cases-home-flu-tests/story?id=128779487</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;As &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/flu-activity-rises-sharply-us-75-million-illnesses-128765018" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;flu season&lt;/a&gt; continues to rise across the United States this holiday season, it may be worth considering an at-home test for the seasonal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The flu season this year is earlier and stronger than last year," &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/video/128778220" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;ABC News medical correspondent Dr. Darien Sutton said Tuesday on "Good Morning America&lt;/a&gt;."

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fitness instructors build energy through consistent daily habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying active, sleeping well and proper nutrition can all boost energy and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enjoyable activities, routines and social connections reduce fatigue and increase motivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Energy can feel out of reach, especially when that midafternoon slump hits and another cup of coffee doesn’t quite do the trick. Sure, it’s easy to blame low energy on poor sleep or not enough caffeine, but it’s more complicated than that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Most people think energy is just about caffeine or sleep, but it’s really the combination of how we fuel, move, rest and manage stress,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.katiehake.com/meettheteam" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Katie Hake, RDN, LD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. “When any one of those buckets runs low, we feel it, often in the form of fatigue, brain fog, irritability, cravings or that ‘wired but tired’ feeling at night.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, fitness instructors often seem to have boundless energy. Teaching back-to-back classes, motivating others and staying upbeat requires physical and mental stamina. Curious what they’re doing differently? We spoke with six fitness instructors to uncover the daily habits that help keep their energy levels high.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For fitness instructors, energy is part of the job. “As a group fitness instructor, it’s essential to have both physical and mental energy when teaching,” says &lt;a href="https://wellnessbyval.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Val Warner, M.S., RD, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. “Energy is contagious,” she adds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But that stamina isn’t accidental. Fitness instructors build and sustain their energy through consistent habits that support both the body and the mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Constantly Moving &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regular movement is one of the biggest drivers of energy. “Physical activity naturally increases blood flow, supports circulation and boosts endorphins—all of which contribute to feeling more alert and energized,” explains &lt;a href="https://rekineticpt.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Rozalyn Moore, PT, D.P.T., AT-ret, CEAS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aerobic exercise increases mood-boosting compounds such as serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which help improve mood, reduce stress and support mental well-being. Resistance training adds another layer of benefit by promoting self-efficacy and supporting emotional regulation. Together, these &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;mental and emotional boosts&lt;/a&gt; translate into feeling better about yourself—and, ultimately, more energized.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While fitness instructors move more than most people, you don’t need to teach classes all day to see benefits. Research shows that short, regular bouts of movement can make a noticeable difference in boosting energy and reducing fatigue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Doing Something They Love &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many fitness instructors genuinely enjoy what they do—and that matters more than you might think. “Most personal trainers are doing a job they love,” explains Moore. “They are energized to help others.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Doing something you enjoy can provide a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-boost-energy-8425516" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meaningful boost in energy&lt;/a&gt; by increasing intrinsic motivation, or motivation driven by personal interest rather than external rewards like approval or recognition. Research shows that higher intrinsic motivation is associated with greater self-satisfaction and overall well-being, which supports a better mood and can translate into higher energy levels.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can tap into this effect, too. Look for small moments of enjoyment in your day—whether that’s a favorite workout, a creative hobby or simply spending time outdoors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Use Daily Habits to Fuel Their Energy &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rather than relying on willpower, fitness instructors tend to stick to predictable routines. “When we create more stable habits—think balanced meals, hydration, consistent movement, reasonable stress management—our energy becomes more predictable and resilient,” explains Hake.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When routines become automatic, they reduce decision fatigue and free up mental bandwidth. This not only conserves energy but also makes it easier to stay consistent with other health-supportive behaviors throughout the day.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Prioritize Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fitness instructors understand the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;importance of sleep&lt;/a&gt;. “Sleep is my number one nonnegotiable,” says Warner. Poor sleep has been linked to lower mood, reduced well-being and higher stress levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep is also when the body rests, repairs and recovers—an essential process if you exercise regularly or are training for an event. “One study found that those who slept longer and experienced better sleep quality had lower blood pressures and heart rates, which ultimately leads to increased well-being in daily life,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-armendariz-649593170" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jennifer Armendariz, RN, FNP-C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Part of a Supportive Community &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Energy isn’t just physical—it’s social, too. “Being around people, music and movement creates a natural lift,” says Hake. “That combination of physical activity, social connection and purpose is a powerful energy generator.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Group fitness instructors often surround themselves with people who prioritize movement in a social setting. “Evidence shows the importance of social connection being linked to higher well-being, safety, resilience and a longer lifespan,” explains &lt;a href="https://wellrootedhn.com/about-us/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Umo Callins, M.S., RD, LD, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Know How to Fuel Well &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fueling properly is another major energy booster. Before teaching a workout class, Warner grabs a carb-packed snack to fuel her muscles: “If I skip this, I feel drained and in slow motion.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Balanced meals throughout the day help maintain energy by stabilizing blood sugar levels and supplying key nutrients to support physical activity. Eating carbohydrates strategically, especially before workouts, fuels your body more efficiently and provides the energy needed to perform at your best.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Your Day with an Energy-Boosting Routine.&lt;/strong&gt; “If you start your day with things you are grateful for, a glass of water, three deep breaths and movement, you have set the tone for a good day and more energy,” says Moore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Daily.&lt;/strong&gt; “Move daily, even if it’s only five minutes,” says Moore. Not every day is going to be perfect, so do your best and build momentum with a schedule, so you make movement automatic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Underestimate Small Mental Boosts.&lt;/strong&gt; “Uplifting music, a 10-minute dance break, fresh air, sunlight and a few moments of mindfulness can go a long way to support your energy,” says &lt;a href="https://www.giselabouvier.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Gisela Bouvier, M.B.A., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try Meditation.&lt;/strong&gt; Callins recommends meditation for emotional stability and mental clarity. “This can be very helpful for individuals who struggle with stress and anxiety, and can help improve sleep hygiene,” she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated.&lt;/strong&gt; “If we aren’t hydrated, our energy, sleep and workouts will suffer,” says Warner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Morning Sunlight.&lt;/strong&gt; “Morning light helps regulate your circadian rhythm, which improves sleep quality and alertness during the day,” says Moore. “Just 10 to 15 minutes outside in the morning can make a difference,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fitness instructors maintain energy through consistent habits that support both body and mind. You can boost your own energy by making small, sustainable daily changes—like moving more often, eating balanced meals, prioritizing sleep and connecting with supportive people. Over time, even these simple adjustments can add up to noticeable improvements in your energy and well-being.

&lt;p id="a9806fb8-5556-44e6-a0d7-6bb4816c2bef"&gt;Centuries ago in Peru, a decapitated individual's head was turned into a "trophy." Now, a careful look at this trophy head reveals that despite a potentially problematic birth defect, the individual survived into early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on several photos of the head, a researcher spotted that the individual was born with a cleft lip, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ahs.ucmerced.edu/content/beth-scaffidi" target="_blank" data-url="https://ahs.ucmerced.edu/content/beth-scaffidi" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Beth Scaffidi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of anthropology and heritage studies at the University of California, Merced, wrote in a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="a9806fb8-5556-44e6-a0d7-6bb4816c2bef-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/Cleft-Craniofacial/Pages/Cleft-Lip-and-Palate-Parent-FAQs.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/Cleft-Craniofacial/Pages/Cleft-Lip-and-Palate-Parent-FAQs.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleft lip and cleft palate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are related conditions in which babies are born with a gap in the lip and/or the roof of their mouth. They are among the most common birth defects, occurring in approximately 1 in 700 live births globally in modern times, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742364/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742364/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests. But diagnosing orofacial clefts (the umbrella term for cleft lip and palate) in archaeological remains is rare, with only around 50 cases identified to date around the world, according to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1232342531059669789&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs12520-022-01546-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Farchaeology%2Fcenturies-old-trophy-head-from-peru-reveals-individual-survived-to-adulthood-despite-disabling-birth-defect" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12520-022-01546-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs12520-022-01546-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Farchaeology%2Fcenturies-old-trophy-head-from-peru-reveals-individual-survived-to-adulthood-despite-disabling-birth-defect" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7cd87a3e-ba89-47f0-9d72-c628051a2329"&gt;The latest study, published Nov. 3 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00776297.2025.2565062" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00776297.2025.2565062" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ñawpa Pacha&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the first time an orofacial cleft has been documented in an Andean trophy head, offering a "unique opportunity" to explore how ancient peoples of the region viewed such conditions, Scaffidi wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding is important because it shows that people survived, and even thrived, with this condition in the ancient Andes," Scaffidi told Live Science in an email.

Most known examples date to between roughly 300 B.C. and A.D. 800, often originating from around modern-day &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/22370-nazca-lines.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/22370-nazca-lines.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nazca&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in coastal Peru's Ica department (Peru has 24 departments, or regions). Trophy heads were likely passed down as heirlooms through generations, Scaffidi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most trophies were mummified naturally in the arid desert environment, and many preserve hair and flesh," Scaffidi said. "We still debate whether these heads were lovingly curated remains of beloved ancestors or souvenirs of violent conquest of enemies, but many do also display violent injuries received before and around the time of death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zLNRzFHm2JBpvHZoc7th7Q" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zLNRzFHm2JBpvHZoc7th7Q slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="bf0e0090-bc1b-4a22-b03f-268f556cf746"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;An illustration of the newly analyzed Andean trophy head, which an artist drew based on catalog photos. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Grace D.

Based on the visible facial structures, she diagnosed the individual with a cleft lip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most serious complication of orofacial clefts is difficulty latching during breastfeeding, but these conditions can also cause respiratory, hearing and speech issues, she wrote in the study. Today, these birth defects are typically treated with surgery in the first few months of life, but in the ancient Andean world they would have presented a significant challenge to mothers and caregivers during the baby's infancy. The individual Scaffidi studied, for example, would likely have required specialized care to receive nourishment as an infant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-eda433b8-9a61-4527-8385-1b67712b67fe" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-special-status-3"&gt;A special status&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="3c1746fa-5277-4776-a05c-04afd782dc22"&gt;But not only did this individual survive into early adulthood, it is possible that their condition even granted them special status, Scaffidi said. Cultural responses to orofacial clefts in the ancient Americas varied widely, from shame to veneration. But taking into account what is known about the worldviews of ancient Andean peoples specifically, it is likely this individual was perceived as sacred and afforded a high-status role throughout life and beyond, Scaffidi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of documentary or textual sources, ancient ceramic vessels from the region — particularly those produced by the Moche culture (A.D. 200 to 850) of northern Peru — provide clues as to how congenital conditions might have been understood at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, Scaffidi found 30 ceramic representations of orofacial clefts that had already been documented from the wider Andean region, 20 of which were from Moche areas. These examples mostly depict males adorned in elite jewelry, head wrappings, or performing shamanic or medical activities, suggesting that they were people of importance. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/16799904" target="_blank" data-url="https://europepmc.org/article/med/16799904" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Other research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the Moche believed facial markings protected them from supernatural harm, thus, birth defect markings were revered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7da8ee03-4a49-4144-81bd-9c541e28d894"&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=23_SEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA67&amp;amp;ots=aHbtlR61_e&amp;amp;sig=VltsBy0zFaFa1vdMB6nIuYtrNR4&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=23_SEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA67&amp;amp;ots=aHbtlR61_e&amp;amp;sig=VltsBy0zFaFa1vdMB6nIuYtrNR4&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Previous research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has indicated that Andean trophy heads were often collected from individuals perceived as having supernatural powers, with the belief that the people taking the heads could use this power to benefit their own communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection of this particular subject as a trophy head, even through potentially violent means, is consistent with the idea that orofacial clefts were celebrated by the takers, Scaffidi said. What may be seen today as a disability was likely considered a "blessing," according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;

Four hours each time. For the rest of his life. That’s dialysis,” warns Milo Yap, highlighting the harsh reality faced by many young Malaysians. “He’s 40. His kidneys failed. ‘But he’s so young,’ everyone said. &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/kidney-disease" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kidney disease"&gt;Kidney disease&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t care about age anymore.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yap explains that lifestyle factors, untreated conditions, and certain habits are contributing to a rise in kidney failure among younger adults. Here’s what he points out:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Uncontrolled diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High blood sugar directly damages your kidneys,” says Milo. “Many are pre-diabetic for years without knowing it, then diabetic, and by the time symptoms appear, their kidneys are 80 per cent destroyed. Diabetes is the number one cause of kidney failure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. High blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You may feel fine and never check your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-pressure" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;,” he continues. “But high blood pressure silently damages the tiny blood vessels in your kidneys until they stop working.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Painkiller overuse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many take NSAIDs like Panadol or Ibuprofen for headaches, body aches, or even hangovers, thinking it’s harmless,” Yap warns. “Over time, these destroy your kidneys.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Energy drinks and unregulated supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pre-workout mixes, energy drinks, and health supplements often contain substances that harm your kidneys,” he adds. “You may think you’re getting healthy, but you’re poisoning yourself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Dehydration and high-protein diets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Skipping plain water while relying on coffee, tea, or high-protein diets stresses the kidneys,” Milo explains. “This can lead to stones, damage, and ultimately failure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yap lists the key signals that kidney function may be declining:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foamy urine (protein leakage)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swollen feet or ankles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor appetite or nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent nighttime urination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you notice two or more of these signs, get your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/kidney-function" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="kidney function"&gt;kidney function&lt;/a&gt; tested immediately,” he advises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Kidney failure means dialysis three times a week, or a transplant if you’re lucky,” Milo says. “It comes with lifetime medication, massive costs, and a shortened lifespan and most cases are preventable.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What you can do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milo recommends:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular kidney function tests (creatinine, eGFR, urine protein)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Controlling blood sugar and blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding regular painkiller use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking 2–3 litres of plain water daily&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steering clear of unregulated supplements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your kidneys filter 200 litres of blood every day,” he concludes. “When they fail, your body poisons itself. Don’t let it get there.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates&lt;/strong&gt; that at least 7.5 million people have been sickened, and more than 3,100 people have died from the flu this season. The surge in cases appears to be driven primarily by a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5661508/flu-cdc-health" target="_blank"&gt;new strain of the virus&lt;/a&gt; known as subclade K of influenza A(H3N2), which emerged over the summer in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-104014" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                There have been at least 7.5 million illnesses and 3,100 deaths from flu this season, according to CDC data. And flu cases are expected to rise significantly in the coming weeks.

   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The new strain doesn't seem to be more severe or dangerous than previous ones&lt;/strong&gt;, NPR's Gabrielle Emanuel tells &lt;em&gt;Up First.&lt;/em&gt; Instead, this year's flu vaccine appears to be mismatched against the virus because it was formulated before the strain emerged. Early data from the U.K. show that the vaccine remains effective at preventing hospitalization. Some health experts, however, have &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5662413:nx-s1-mx-5662413-1" target="_blank"&gt;raised concerns that the federal government&lt;/a&gt; has failed to launch a strong flu vaccination campaign.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump's critics say that a strike on a Venezuelan facility is dragging the U.S. &lt;/strong&gt;even closer to a more dangerous conflict. This week, the president revealed new details about an attack against a Venezuelan dock allegedly used to load drugs onto boats. The latest operation marks the first known U.S. strike inside Venezuela — an escalation of Trump's campaign against Nicolás Maduro's government. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧&lt;strong&gt; The strike is significant because it raises the risk&lt;/strong&gt; of killing people who have nothing to do with narcotics trafficking, NPR's Franco Ordoñez says. Up until this strike, the U.S. was targeting some sanctioned oil tankers and boats suspected of trafficking drugs. Both of those operations have &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5662413:nx-s1-mx-5662413-1" target="_blank"&gt;taken place in international waters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iran is experiencing its largest protests in years as thousands of people, unhappy with the state of the economy, flood the streets.&lt;/strong&gt; Inflation in the country has skyrocketed, and the currency has plummeted to a record low. Public anger is growing over sanctions against the ruling government. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;Months of anger and frustration over water and energy shortages&lt;/strong&gt;, civil rights abuses and widespread corruption have fueled the current unrest, NPR's Jackie Northam says. These criticisms, combined with the economic protests, have the potential to spiral into something significantly larger. The 12-day war Iran had with Israel over the summer was costly. There is now a widespread belief that Israel will start another conflict with the country, which would &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5662413:nx-s1-mx-5662413-1" target="_blank"&gt;add more economic uncertainty&lt;/a&gt;, Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, tells Northam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Living better&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-103597" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

Package theft, however, can happen any time of year. In fact, the security research company SafeWise estimates that thieves steal about 250,000 packages every day. Sometimes, instead of a new iPad, the thief might swipe a mail order of medicine. Here's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/24/nx-s1-5642562/porch-pirates-mail-theft-medicine-drugs" target="_blank"&gt;what you should do about it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;💊 Schedule deliveries for when you are home. Companies such as CVS Caremark offer customers package tracking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💊 Having a delivery spot that's hidden or even a locker for your porch that doesn't lock can be a good deterrent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💊 See if you can opt into requiring a signature upon delivery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💊 Consider getting medicines delivered to a P.O. box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Picture show&lt;/h3&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At the Plum Island Museum of Lost Toys &amp;amp; Curiosities, one-time treasures find a new home, bring back memories and warn of the permanence of plastic waste. The collection of items started when the museum's founder, Corinn Flaherty, spotted the head of a 1940s-era doll on a deserted beach in 2015. What began as a "hot mess" of stuff in her home evolved into an official museum in Amesbury, Mass., which opened its doors in 2021. The space is a kaleidoscope of color, with carefully curated displays on shelves made from driftwood. Take a look at the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/24/nx-s1-5647280/plum-island-museum-lost-toys-curiosities" target="_blank"&gt;artfully arranged items inside the museum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3 things to know before you go&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98990" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unusual changes in &lt;strong&gt;how food tastes&lt;/strong&gt; are often overlooked. A bitter aftertaste, metallic sensation, or sudden dullness in flavour might be dismissed as harmless or temporary. Yet these symptoms are gaining attention in clinical settings as potential signs of deeper health issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many cases, patients reporting distorted taste or smell are later diagnosed with viral infections, sinus inflammation, or oral conditions. These sensory changes sometimes precede other symptoms, offering early indicators that something in the body has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although&lt;strong&gt; loss of taste &lt;/strong&gt;and smell became widely recognised during the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers now report that similar sensory disruptions occur across a much broader range of illnesses. The mechanisms behind these changes are still being studied, but links to immune response, chronic inflammation and mucosal disruption are becoming clearer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Taste Disruption Common in Respiratory Illness and Postnasal Drip&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Respiratory infections frequently impair taste and smell. Among the most common culprits is &lt;strong&gt;postnasal drip&lt;/strong&gt;, a condition where excess mucus drains from the sinuses into the throat. This process can alter flavour perception by coating the tongue and carrying bacteria or &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/06/new-bat-viruses-in-china-spark-serious-concerns-greater-risks-for-humans-and-livestock/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="93969" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; that produce unusual or unpleasant tastes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinical specialists at the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/bitter-taste-in-mouth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; describe how nasal congestion reduces the sense of smell, thereby diminishing the experience of flavour. The &lt;a href="https://sleepandsinuscenters.com/blog/postnasal-drip-effects-on-taste-causes-and-remedies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep and Sinus Centers of Georgia&lt;/a&gt; explain that postnasal mucus interferes with olfactory signals, contributing to taste distortion. Mucus may also carry inflammatory particles or pathogens that further impair the taste receptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Taste is not driven by the tongue alone. Experts note that flavour is the result of both taste buds and &lt;strong&gt;olfactory input&lt;/strong&gt;. When nasal airflow is blocked, food may seem flavourless or strange, even when eaten with a normal appetite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infections like &lt;strong&gt;COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt; have intensified focus on these symptoms. A report from the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/30/health/funny-taste-in-your-mouth-these-infections-could-be-to-blame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 affects support cells near the olfactory neurons. This may explain persistent symptoms such as &lt;strong&gt;parageusia&lt;/strong&gt;, a distorted taste often described as metallic, that can linger after infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Inflammation May Alter Bitter Taste Perception&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research is uncovering how &lt;strong&gt;inflammation&lt;/strong&gt; may alter taste directly. A peer-reviewed study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4567432/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain, Behavior, and Immunity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; focused on the role of &lt;strong&gt;tumour necrosis factor&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;TNF&lt;/strong&gt;), a cytokine produced by the immune system during illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that mice lacking &lt;strong&gt;TNF&lt;/strong&gt; were significantly less responsive to &lt;strong&gt;bitter compounds&lt;/strong&gt; like quinine, while sensitivity to sweet, salty, sour and umami flavours remained unchanged. TNF was found to be active in specific taste bud cells, suggesting that inflammatory signals may shape bitter taste perception during immune activation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Taste-changes-can-be-an-early-sign-of-infections-or-immune-response-at-work.jpg.webp" alt="Asian,child,girl,eating,ice,cream,have,sense,of,taste,problems" class="wp-image-114998" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Taste-changes-can-be-an-early-sign-of-infections-or-immune-response-at-work.jpg.webp 1000w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Taste-changes-can-be-an-early-sign-of-infections-or-immune-response-at-work-420x280.jpg.webp 420w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Taste-changes-can-be-an-early-sign-of-infections-or-immune-response-at-work-520x347.jpg.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taste changes can be an early sign of infections or immune response at work. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that TNF may selectively modulate bitter flavour response, providing a biological explanation for the persistent bitterness some people experience during or after illness. These findings suggest that &lt;strong&gt;inflammatory proteins&lt;/strong&gt;, not just local damage or congestion, may drive taste disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may be especially relevant in &lt;strong&gt;chronic inflammatory diseases&lt;/strong&gt;, where elevated cytokine levels are common and taste symptoms are frequently reported.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Health Conditions and Lifestyle Factors That Affect Taste&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond viral infections, several other conditions have been linked to persistent taste alterations. As outlined by the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/16708-loss-of-taste-and-smell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic’s health guidance&lt;/a&gt;, causes range from oral infections to neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastroesophageal reflux disease&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;GERD&lt;/strong&gt;) is one such cause. Acid rising from the stomach into the throat can produce a &lt;strong&gt;bitter&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;sour&lt;/strong&gt; taste, especially when lying down. Inflammation from acid exposure also affects the lining of the mouth and throat, altering taste sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Periodontitis&lt;/strong&gt;, or gum disease, involves inflammation and bacterial buildup in the mouth that may result in bleeding gums, halitosis, and a lingering &lt;strong&gt;metallic flavour&lt;/strong&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;oral thrush&lt;/strong&gt; — a yeast infection caused by &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; — produces creamy white patches and a sour or dry taste sensation. The &lt;em&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/em&gt; identifies both as common sources of taste distortion, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Inflammation-and-illness-can-affect-how-the-brain-processes-flavor-signals.jpg.webp" alt="Inflammation And Illness Can Affect How The Brain Processes Flavor Signals" class="wp-image-115002" srcset="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Inflammation-and-illness-can-affect-how-the-brain-processes-flavor-signals.jpg.webp 850w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Inflammation-and-illness-can-affect-how-the-brain-processes-flavor-signals-420x216.jpg.webp 420w,https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Inflammation-and-illness-can-affect-how-the-brain-processes-flavor-signals-520x268.jpg.webp 520w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inflammation and illness can affect how the brain processes flavor signals. Credit: Pu Feng&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other contributing factors include medications such as &lt;strong&gt;antihistamines&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;antidepressants&lt;/strong&gt;, many of which list altered taste as a known side effect. Hormonal changes during &lt;strong&gt;pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;menopause&lt;/strong&gt; may alter taste receptor sensitivity, while &lt;strong&gt;dry mouth&lt;/strong&gt; from dehydration or certain treatments further reduces flavour detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurological conditions&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt; are frequently associated with taste dysfunction. These disorders interfere with the brain’s sensory integration, and in some cases, taste changes may occur before more serious neurological symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Clinical Response and Research Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taste or smell alterations that persist beyond two weeks, particularly if paired with other symptoms, should be investigated further. As the &lt;em&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/em&gt; notes, loss of these senses can reflect a range of systemic issues, including infections, endocrine disorders and neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many cases, resolving the underlying problem — whether sinus inflammation, oral infection or medication interaction — restores sensory function. Following COVID-19, most individuals regain normal taste and smell within 60 days, though some report lasting disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The long-term impact of inflammatory signals such as &lt;strong&gt;TNF&lt;/strong&gt; on human sensory processing remains an active area of investigation. Researchers are exploring how immune activity in taste bud cells may interact with other physiological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;b&gt;Karen Ann Canham&lt;/b&gt;, CEO and founder of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://www.karenannwellness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Karen Ann Wellness&lt;/a&gt;, walking works best when it’s combined with strength training. This workout modality helps sculpt lean muscle and give your metabolism a solid boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Strength training two to three times per week helps the body burn more fat at rest,” Canham tells us. “[In addition,] adequate protein intake supports muscle maintenance after 50.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having effective stress-management techniques at your fingertips is another essential, as cortisol can majorly impact belly fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Quality sleep improves hormone balance and fat regulation as well,” Canham adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These small adjustments turn walking into a waist focused workout. Consistency with these tricks produces visible change,” Canham stresses.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/10-minute-interval-walking-workouts/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interval walking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This requires you to alternate between one minute of brisk walking with two minutes of walking at a comfortable pace to rev up fat burn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Ankle weights:&lt;/b&gt; According to Canham, “Adding light &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/ankle-weight-exercises-for-toned-thighs/" target="_blank"&gt;ankle weights&lt;/a&gt; during short walks increases core and hip engagement which helps tighten the waist.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Arm swings:&lt;/b&gt; Walking while intentionally swinging your arms engages your upper body and promotes trunk rotation, which fires up the obliques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Using solid posture:&lt;/b&gt; Walking with proper posture—standing tall and gently bringing the belly inward—engages the deep core muscles with each step you take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Inclines:&lt;/b&gt; “Walking on slight inclines such as hills or treadmill grades increases abdominal engagement,” Canham tells us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; Consistency: &lt;/b&gt;According to North, consistency is king if you want real results. “Try to walk daily and remember that sleep and nutrition are vital partners to our personal walking routine for fat loss,” he shares.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you head into your 40s, 50s, and beyond, you may notice a redistribution of body fat. With age, fat tends to gravitate toward the midsection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fat distribution changes with age due to hormonal shifts that favor storage in the abdominal area,” Canham explains. “Muscle mass naturally declines which slows metabolism. Stress and poor sleep increase cortisol which promotes belly fat. Insulin sensitivity also decreases making fat storage easier. Postural changes weaken the deep core and push the abdomen forward. Reduced activity levels compound these effects. These changes are common but responsive to targeted movement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quicker you walk, the more efficiently your fat-burning hormones will be activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Walking intensity significantly impacts abdominal fat loss: lower, steady intensity (slow/moderate pace) uses more fat for fuel, while higher intensity (brisk/intervals) burns more total calories and boosts metabolism, leading to greater overall fat loss, especially visceral fat, but requires more carbs initially,” North explains. “For best results, interval walking (mixing fast/slow) or brisk, consistent moderate-intensity walks combined with a healthy diet are key to burning fat and reducing waistlines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                After caring for his brother, who has schizophrenia, for many years Mitul Desai started a company to support caregivers like him.

        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For years, Mitul Desai felt that the best way to deal with his little brother's schizophrenia was to avoid talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His brother had become angry and withdrawn during his first year in college in 1996, and then started hearing and seeing things that weren't there. Over four years doctors told the family he had everything from alcoholism to bipolar disorder, until finally he got the correct diagnosis. It was chaotic and frightening. There were also emergencies — major arguments, trips to the hospital, that time they had to convince the neighbors not to call the police.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Desai compartmentalized. During these years, he focused on the brilliant career he was building as an intellectual property attorney, Wall Street analyst and senior adviser at the State Department. From the office he helped his family by navigating the health care system, talking to the experts and keeping on top of the endless forms and phone calls required to keep his brother stable. His parents, especially his father, handled the day-to-day, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Nobody around him understood what it was like to have a close family member with a severe mental illness, so he kept quiet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I felt we were the only family in the world going through this," he says. He and his parents couldn't even talk about their emotions with one other. It was like they were all trapped in their own silos, unable to connect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Slowly the pain of the situation seeped into everything else. Desai was angry, anxious and depressed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, he saved every article he saw about schizophrenia, every research paper or resource, every idea he had about how to fix the problem. He told himself that some day he was going to do something to help — not just his brother, but anyone in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Some day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Every Sunday night, that thought returned. He enjoyed the work, but five years into a high-level corporate job it struck him: Is this really my purpose in life? He quit that week, and started volunteering at the Fountain House, a nonprofit that focuses on peer support and community for people with mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-104055" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;He learned that for serious mental illness, family caregiving and community support are just as &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1752-0606.2003.tb01202.x" target="_blank"&gt;important to recovery&lt;/a&gt; as the right prescription. Mental health caregivers are the first and last line of defense. Yet they &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5660935/family-caregiver-support-policies-states" target="_blank"&gt;don't get the support&lt;/a&gt; and resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was a turning point. He started planning and working toward a vision to create a new kind of business that would recognize the crucial role of mental health caregivers, and provide them with more help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of the roughly 63 million caregivers in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2019/04/home-alone-revisited-family-caregivers-providing-complex-care.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;23% help someone&lt;/a&gt; with a mental health problem such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Another 4% care for people with addictions.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Caring for someone with one of these invisible illnesses can be particularly stressful. Crises erupt with little warning. Mental health care can be hard to find and confusing to navigate. Friends and relatives are often judgmental or fearful. It's like a secret society that nobody talks about and nobody wants to join.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Learning to see an invisible illness&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Helping someone with a serious mental illness is different from caregiving in the context of common medical problems like heart disease or cancer. Disorders that primarily affect cognition, behavior and emotions are hard to recognize and hard for other people to understand or accept.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For many caregivers, the first challenge is often just figuring out what's going on. Symptoms like paranoia, apathy or delusions can be easily confused with stubbornness, bad temper or substance abuse, and someone dealing with these problems may find it impossible to describe.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Once they wrap their heads around the situation, caregivers then find themselves becoming the translator.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Caregivers are often faced with the burden of having to educate themselves and other people about the condition their loved ones have," says Dr. Christine Crawford, the associate medical director for the National Alliance on Mental Illness.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most people understand and sympathize with someone who has cancer or a stroke. Not so with mental illness. Friends and family suspect drugs, laziness or bad moral character. Pray it away, they might say — or they blame the family for being too lax, too strict, too &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once you have a relative diagnosed with cancer, you get greeting cards and balloons, as you should," says Desai. "When you have a relative diagnosed with serious mental illness you are greeted with silence. It takes its toll."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Families may find that the stigma of mental illness extends to them, too. After Greg Green's baby girl was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, the family found social support at school and among disability-rights advocates. Now an adult, she's a Special Olympics ambassador, and her dad is on two commissions that oversee policy for people living with disabilities in their state. They found strength in community.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It was a different story when Green's son developed mental health problems as a teenager. The family had to explain over and over again what was going on with him — why he wouldn't make eye contact, or why his body language was awkward and off-putting. And still people didn't get it. Their house had been known for community events and family get-togethers. That all stopped.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was far more difficult to find social support than it had been with his daughter, says Green, and he blames stigma: "I think the number one issue is fear, not wanting to be involved."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-104056" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When friends and family withdraw, it's hard on both the caregiver and the person with mental illness. From the start, Desai was determined to find his brother the best medical treatment available by seeking out the top experts and enrolling him in clinical trials. It was only later that he learned that community and peer support are also essential components of recovery. His family's isolation wasn't just painful — it was actually doing harm.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That experience focused his plans. The company he was creating would train and educate caregiver families, but also combat the stigma and isolation by including peer support — helping build the community that can be so hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Caregiving like no other&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One reason that mental health caregivers particularly need support is that caring for someone with a serious mental illness can be nerve-racking, simply because of the nature of these disorders and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Caregivers often feel they can never let down their guard. People with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder may be quiet and withdrawn for a long time, then unexpectedly slip into a psychotic episode. A bout of major depression can strike for no apparent reason. The caregiver constantly tracks the ebb and flow of symptoms, watching for an alarming shift in mood or cognition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And sometimes a loved one may disengage from treatment or refuse help altogether, and it's the caregiver's job to try to talk them into it. If an adult is considered to be no danger to themselves or another, they cannot be forced into treatment no matter how precarious their situation becomes.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Green's son lived at home safely into his late 20s until his usual medicine went through a shortage in February 2024. (NPR is not using his name in order to protect his privacy in discussing mental health issues.) He was switched to a new drug, which didn't work. The trust between father and son broke down, and the young man eventually decided that the treatment was poison. At the end of May, a conversation about work touched off a massive argument and he stormed out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since then he has been homeless, at first in his car, then bouncing between hospitals, treatment centers, and the street. Green says that for months, his son refused to accept anything from him, or even speak with him.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This is not uncommon with mental or cognitive illness. Misunderstandings can boil up into arguments, and caregivers have to think about safety, says Crawford: keeping guns and knives out of the house, locking up medications or even taking the door off the hinges in the person's bedroom to monitor their activity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These tasks are mentally and emotionally draining, points out Marvell Adams, Jr., the CEO of Caregiver Action Network. The job of connecting with someone who is withdrawn or delusional is always a work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Caregivers live with the suffering they witness, as well as the frustration of not being able to truly understand the reality of the person they love. Just like with dementia, caregivers may feel they no longer even know the person they care for. It takes a toll, says Adams. It's common for someone supporting a person with major depression, for instance, to develop depression themselves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Green, his son's departure didn't mean his caregiving role was over. It just became more harrowing. Earlier this month, his son was arrested for trespassing at a construction site; Green thinks he was probably looking for a place to sleep. Now, Green is juggling court proceedings and appointments with the motor vehicles office, trying to replace all the documents that were lost during the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His son checks in now and then, but is still living outside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm constantly thinking about him," Green says. Every time he opens his internet browser, he checks his son's medical records, logs in to his bank account to see where he's been, and worries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every night I go to bed thinking: Where is he tonight? It's raining, it's cold. Does he have a place?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He figured out a way to help by passing items like a phone charger or benefits card along to outreach workers, who will give it to him without mentioning where it came from. At night, he racks his brains for more ways to help his son.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Building new supports for family&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A family member's dedication can make all the difference in the lives of people they care for. After years of helping with his brother's mental illness, Mitul Desai learned that the evidence actually proves it: The best treatment for mental illness combines good medical care, peer connections and family support. None of that can happen without engaged, committed caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Recognizing their role is not just better for the person in question; it also benefits the health care system and the hospitals, courts and jails where people often wind up and which aren't equipped to help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2023, Desai launched The CareHack along with psychiatrist Eli Shalenberg. It offers education, coaching and real-time advice for family caregivers dealing with severe mental illness, dementia and other diseases that affect the mind.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-104057" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;
            
&lt;div class="credit-caption"&gt;
    &lt;div class="caption-wrap"&gt;
        &lt;div class="caption" aria-label="Image caption"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                When Desai learned how helpful peer and family support is for someone with serious mental illness, he decided to focus his company around helping family caregivers play that role.

                &lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;b class="hide-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;hide caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


            &lt;b class="toggle-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;toggle caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;
        
        José A. Alvarado Jr. for NPR
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The company doesn't offer its services directly to families. Instead, it will work within the system, where Desai thinks they can do the most good. The bet is that the big players in the for-profit health care system will recognize the value that caregivers bring to mental health treatment. The pitch to them: happier, more resilient caregivers reduce expensive hospitalizations and help patients stay healthy and stable.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CareHack's customers could include insurance companies that recognize the cost savings that come from supporting and training family caregivers, or large practices focused on mental health and substance abuse so they can offer more granular support to the families who care for these patients every day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Basically, Desai created the support he wished he'd had decades ago. Caregivers can watch short videos or listen to lessons online, or get customized coaching from experienced social workers. They also get hooked up with other families in similar situations, to problem-solve and share stories together, overseen by a moderator. These services are free to them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Desai's business is now working with one multi-state practice, and launching a Medicaid-funded project in New York State. They plan to run a clinical trial, a formal test, of the CareHack model to demonstrate its value for their potential partners.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, caregivers can find information and advice from nonprofits with specialized mental health programs. NAMI offers a free eight-week peer-led &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/support-education/mental-health-education/nami-family-to-family/" target="_blank"&gt;training course&lt;/a&gt; as well as family therapy clinics targeting the first episode of psychosis. Caregiver Action Network recently created a &lt;a href="https://www.caregiveraction.org/blueprint-for-mental-health-issues/" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to caring for cognitive and behavioral problems, and launched an online peer-to-peer network to connect caregivers with advocates who offer advice and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Being prepared for a crisis can potentially make a big difference. Carers and their loved ones can collaborate during stable times to create a mental health &lt;a href="https://nrc-pad.org/getting-started/" target="_blank"&gt;advance directive&lt;/a&gt; that spells out who should make decisions during a critical situation, and what should be done to calm things down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when a crisis comes, there are often better alternatives than calling 911. The nationwide 988 lifeline, rolled out in 2022, is intended for mental health emergencies. Counselors rather than police dispatchers answer the 988 call, and if necessary dispatch a crisis response team with training in mental health. Green also recommends calling the non-emergency line for the local police or the nearest psychiatric hospital's crisis team.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both Desai and his brother are doing better these days. His brother is at an assisted living facility near their parents. Desai has spent time processing his experiences, recognizing the way he is affected by feelings like survivor's guilt — his grief at knowing his brother will never get to enjoy some of the simple pleasures in life, like hanging out with friends on a Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dealing openly with his brother's illness has taught Desai grit, resilience and what he calls extreme empathy: "The minute I meet somebody who has this experience, I'm just bonded."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He will not be able to cure his brother, or lift the stress from his parents. But what once felt like a failure, a source of shame and stigma, now has a purpose: a promise that other families will not have to endure this alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.katmcgowan.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kat McGowan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a caregiving reporter based in Berkeley, Calif.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105941" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that &lt;a href="https://wired.com/tag/sleep/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; quality may have a direct impact on the rate at which &lt;a href="https://wired.jp/tag/brains/"&gt;the brain ages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;"Our findings provide evidence that poor sleep may contribute to accelerated brain aging," &lt;a data-offer-url="https://news.ki.se/poor-sleep-may-accelerate-brain-ageing" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://news.ki.se/poor-sleep-may-accelerate-brain-ageing"}' href="https://news.ki.se/poor-sleep-may-accelerate-brain-ageing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Abigail Dove, a neuroepidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, "and point to inflammation as one of the underlying mechanisms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;High Correlation With Night-Owl Lifestyle and Snoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers assessed the quality of their sleep across five dimensions in 27,500 middle-aged and elderly people (average age 54.7 years) enrolled in the UK Biobank (a research institute conducting long-term follow-up studies of the effects of genetic predisposition and lifestyle on disease). Approximately nine years later, they scanned the participants' brains with MRI and used machine learning models to estimate their biological brain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers quantified sleep quality based on chronotype (morningness or eveningness), duration of sleep, presence or absence of insomnia, presence or absence of snoring, and daytime sleepiness. Using these data, they categorized participants into three sleep patterns, finding that 41.2 percent had healthy sleep, 3.3 percent had clearly poor sleep, and 55.6 percent fell into the middle group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The analysis showed that for every point decrease in the healthy sleep score, the difference between brain age and chronological age increased by approximately six months. The group with the poorest sleep quality showed that their brains were approximately one year older than their chronological age. This suggests that differences in sleep duration and sleep habits can significantly affect the rate at which the brain ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Researchers have found that a night-owl lifestyle, unhealthy sleep duration (beyond 7-8 hours), and snoring habits are particularly strongly associated with brain aging. They also found that the five factors that determine sleep quality interact with each other. For example, insomnia can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness, and a nocturnal lifestyle can lead to shorter sleep times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Poor Sleep Leads to Chronic Inflammation in the Body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To understand the mechanism by which poor sleep affects the brain, the research team also measured the level of low-grade inflammation in the body. Specifically, they used a combination of biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein levels, white blood cell and platelet counts, and the ratio of granulocytes to lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell), to analyze the role of inflammation in the relationship between sleep patterns and brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The results confirmed that higher levels of inflammation in the body tend to increase brain age. Mediation analysis (a method of analyzing the influence of variables intermediate in the causal relationship between two variables) found that inflammation explained approximately 7 percent of the association between intermediate sleep patterns and brain aging, and more than 10 percent of the association with poor sleep patterns. In other words, it is highly likely that poor sleep quality makes it easier for chronic inflammation to occur in the body, which in turn accelerates brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In addition to inflammation, there are several other ways that poor sleep can negatively affect the brain. One is through its negative impact on the glymphatic system, which primarily removes waste products from the brain during sleep. If toxic substances in the brain are not efficiently removed during sleep, this could impair the function of nerve cells in the long term. Researchers have also pointed out that poor sleep can worsen cardiovascular health, which indirectly damages blood flow and tissue in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared in WIRED Japan and has been translated from Japanese.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9SR08zZzdFWjktbG1DRnFMcVNQOS04VGZDRzVGSFo1QzMzV0RzNjZVUGdCc3FMczlkcE1SbEZwdjlkUUR6MTd5QWlJRnJ6dHBHemdIRWc1azBFUUExVE1mZnZZSkozU0MtUXhJUXhuOUdqaVRJdXRCT2E1WQ</guid></item><item><title>Duke Health因呼吸系统疾病病例增加而限制访客，加入其他医院系统- WRAL</title><link>https://www.wral.com/news/local/duke-health-limits-visitors-effective-jan-6-2026/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Duke Health will limit hospital visitors starting Jan. 6, 2026 out of concern due to the rise of respiratory illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The Duke University Health System stated in a press release that hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers will temporarily limit patient visitations, effective Tuesday, Jan. 6. The release did not say when these limitations will be lifted, but it did say that the restrictions will be reviewed if and when respiratory illness cases decline. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Daytime visitors of hospital and ambulatory surgery patients will be limited to no more than two people aged 12 and older. Overnight visitors must be at least 18 unless they are the parent or caregiver of a pediatric patient. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The restrictions are part of a multi-step approach to protect patients and prevent the spread of influenza, RSV and COVID-19 across the health system.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The temporary initiatives effective on Jan. 6 include: &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patients may receives no more than two visitors at one time. Additional visitor guidelines apply for some patients. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children under 12 are not permitted to visit hospitals or units without prior approval from health care providers and for special circumstances. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors are urged to wear masks while visiting patients and to wash their hands frequently. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors with fever, cough or other flu-like symptoms should stay at home. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This announcement from Duke Health comes shortly after &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/wakemed-flu-season-visitor-restrictions-december-2025/"&gt;Cape Fear Valley Hospitals and WakeMed Hospitals&lt;/a&gt; implemented their visitor limitations, which started the week of Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts0ybv00df3ckpj9bbsjec@published"&gt;For some godforsaken reason, my twin sister has decided that some 50-year-old sad sack, less than a year into his divorce, is her new soulmate. His oldest child is less than seven years apart from us in age. He left his wife of 25 years because he was “afraid of not living.” He just is begging fate to be 20 again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jd1000n3b79awaat5k0@published"&gt;Our group of friends is very centered on the outdoors. We hike, bike, camp, swim, and sail. My sister’s boyfriend brags about being able to do all these activities, but he can’t. We are left with a whining man-baby who can’t bother to pack sunscreen or extra water, and our entire trip draws to a screeching halt while my sister plays nurse. It is so cringe that most of my friends don’t want to see my sister anymore. I tried to point out to her it’s because she and her boyfriend refused to stop doing activities he couldn’t physically do and then complained that they were left behind. But she wants to play martyr here! She says no one understands their love or their “amazing connection.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="185" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jex000o3b79idlo1on7@published"&gt;Then she called me to tell me about the trip she went on with his friends, where she tried to “bond” with his kids! Apparently, his friends treated her as an idiot and an infant, while his kids directly told her fuck off. I just started to laugh. It was the worst type of cliché. Did she really, in her heart of hearts, expect to get a warm welcome from them? She &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t warmed up to our stepmother despite our dad getting remarried several years after the divorce (and they’re the same age, at least). She told me I was unsupportive and called me names, so I asked her why she told me to tell her the truth and then expected a lie? This guy wasn’t into her for her “old soul,” he wanted to screw someone young and hot. She hung up on me and blocked me on social media. Our parents are furious with me. They say I pushed my sister back into the arms of a predator and are afraid that she is going to get pregnant to define their “love.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jgy000p3b7998z0qp55@published"&gt;Honestly,  I am angry with my twin for being so smart and acting so stupid here, and I am tired of cleaning up after her mess. I have been doing it for months. It isn’t like the guy is rich or handsome. He’s just pathetic and desperate. So what now?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jiz000q3b797o7hk2pq@published"&gt;—Bad Cliché&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5jmv000s3b79st5fyejy@published"&gt;I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I think you screwed up big time here. One of the enduring facts of life is that, occasionally, your friends and relatives are going to date people that suck. This guy certainly seems to fit the bill. I, too, would totally get annoyed at this unmoored Gen Xer nursing his swollen ankles on a hike he begged to go on. But outside of this weird interaction your sister had with his kids and friends—which does seem pretty bad!—I am not detecting anything that would require an immediate intervention. Your diagnosis is spot on. Your twin, indeed, appears to be enmeshed with a mid-life weenie who is attempting to fill a gaping void with the attention he believes he is owed from younger women. But while that’s never a great place to be, it’s also a tale as old as time.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts5joy000t3b79kzmtzn18@published"&gt;Here’s the thing though: Eventually whatever honeymoon period these two are enjoying will flicker out. At that point, when this man transforms back into the greying divorcée who doesn’t know how to pack for a camping trip, she will begin to complain about him. It appears that has already happened! Your twin beseeched your guidance, but you responded in a way that left her feeling stupid and more dug-in. That’s not the move! When anyone gripes about a partner you hate, you need to tread &lt;em&gt;carefully. &lt;/em&gt;Validate her concerns! Be sympathetic about the things she likes about him! But also, be ready to surgically unveil the numerous traits about his character that you find undeserving of her love. Because, remember, it is your sister’s well-being that is important here. There is a time and a place for the I-told-you-so gloating, and it is a group text that she isn’t in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716e00173b7907qv2mkj@published"&gt;My husband and I have always been on the same page about not wanting kids. My sister is a single mom and recently moved closer to us, so we’ve been spending a lot of time with her and her young son. My husband’s been amazing with him.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716f00183b79npj2smhr@published"&gt;He plays with him all the time, gladly takes him places, and seems to genuinely love being with him. It has everyone who knows us, including my parents, constantly telling me what a great dad he’d be and how “we should really have kids.” It’s awful. Seeing my husband happily playing with the kiddo has me questioning whether he is really happy being childless (he insists he is), and every comment cuts at my newfound insecurity about our relationship. I am dreading spending time with friends and family, particularly over the holidays, because I know I will be fending off well-meaning remarks that make me want to lash out. I’d really appreciate a script to shut down the comments before they start or an approach to preventing them altogether, preferably before I punch somebody.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716g001a3b79gtdafoxk@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Mind Your Mouth,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="167" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716g001b3b79mi373x0n@published"&gt;So here’s the thing. The persona that your husband has embodied—and the same one that is open to you—is that of the “fun uncle,” or “fun aunt,” which are two of the most sacred and beloved characters in American family life. In fact, I’d reckon that it is imperative among us childless millennials to fulfill that role for the good of our collective social hygiene. Show up, rile up the nieces and nephews, have a couple gin and tonics, and head home with the sublime peace of mind that whatever fallout lingers around the corner (bath, bedtime, ugly public meltdowns) is not your responsibility. What I am trying to say here is that there is not a one-to-one correlation between being “good with children” and “wanting children.” If you and your husband have come to a genuine consensus about how you envision the rest of your marriage—and that it won’t include kids—then I seriously don’t think you need to worry that he’s harboring some hidden progenic desires.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="166" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716i001c3b79bl8l740v@published"&gt;Now, onto the more important matter. Your relatives needling you about your stewardship of the family tree is &lt;em&gt;absolutely &lt;/em&gt;bad behavior. But any attempt to tamp down those comments in a curt, decisive way—while gathered around the tree on Christmas Eve or whatever—is likely going to leave everyone in the room feeling a little awkward. I am going to guess that those child-rearing remarks are coming from a place of good-faith cluelessness, and while I don’t know the kind of relationship you have with your mother and sister, I’d like to think that the issue could be defanged with more empathy in private. I think something soft but direct—”hey, the way you always tell my husband and me that we’d be great parents makes me feel funny,” perhaps during a walk around the neighborhood—could be a jumping off point for a conversation on a tender subject. That is, of course, if the parties involved understand that it’s OK to not want kids, which they obviously &lt;em&gt;should. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716i001d3b794nu2t0qz@published"&gt;One last observation: Regardless of your and your husband’s ambivalence towards expanding your own family, I do get the sense that he &lt;em&gt;likes &lt;/em&gt;kids more than you. And that’s OK! We all have our tolerance levels. But I’d recommend that you get down on the carpet and try to play with your nieces and nephews, next time you see them. Join in on the fun! It might provide some clarity to the family dynamic, and you might be surprised by how much you enjoy yourself. Become the Fun Aunt, and everything else will fall into place naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the years, it’s expanded to include their own longtime friends as well. Those of us who are local still hang out regularly on the weekends, and we game together on Discord every week and stay in touch with some of the guys who have moved away through there.  I would say I generally know the basic facts of what’s going on in each guy’s life, but the problem I keep running into is how to help one of them when they’re clearly not doing well. Over the past year, I’ve seen some of them go through it: one of them is getting a bit too into sports online betting, another was laid off and keeps having no luck in finding another job, one of them has alluded to feeling down about being “directionless” in life, etc. But the only way we hear about these things from each other is through passing comments, and we never really go much deeper than that. I want to be there for them, but it’s hard to figure out how. It feels like we’re all facing real-life shit now, and it’s difficult to figure out how to help them or bring up the subject when half the time we’re just preoccupied talking about our shared hobbies instead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="209" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjts716l001i3b790bxzc8vh@published"&gt;Brother, you are overthinking this. In fact, I would argue that you are already in a prime position to spark up the deeper conversations you want to be having with your friends. There is an old joke about how straight men can only bond with one another when they are relying on some sort of a buffer—be it a football game, a Nintendo Switch 2, or whatever else—to tamp down the tension of, like, eye-contact, or whatever topsy-turvy weight we’ve collectively put on one-on-one hangs. This, unfortunately, is 100 percent true. I have had deep, soul-searching inquiries about, like, the nature of mortality, or the nuances of marriage, or the unforgiving job market, while simultaneously calling a cornerback blitz in &lt;em&gt;EA Sports College Football 25. &lt;/em&gt;The hobbies you guys share are the ideal conduit to delve into all of the heavy stuff, in an environment that nonetheless feels pretty chummy and casual.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Yes, some of the crises your friends are facing are tough to navigate (in particular, I’d be gentle while approaching a problematic sports-betting habit), but your desire for deeper conversations here can be quickly ameliorated by simply &lt;em&gt;shooting the shit&lt;/em&gt;, ideally with some &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; and maybe a six pack of High Lifes coloring in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

(My mother died over a decade ago.) My stepmother’s two adult children both have dogs they dote on, and their mother showers the dogs with affection and loves to talk about her grandpups. Nothing wrong with that! However, since my daughter was born, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/grandparent-talks-granddaughter-like-pet-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;my stepmother has frequently made comparisons between my daughter and these dogs.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Wastewater analysis sites in the area are also showing high levels of the flu, “meaning it is very prevalent in the community right now,” Weiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idaho stands out in dark red among its neighboring states on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s weekly flu map, which shows the worst of flu season impacting the East Coast and some southern states, and of course Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;                        &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.idahostatesman.com/public/latest-news/tyrrqn/picture314067868/alternates/FREE_1140/cdc%20flu%20map.png" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.idahostatesman.com/public/latest-news/tyrrqn/picture314067868/alternates/FREE_960/cdc%20flu%20map.png" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.idahostatesman.com/public/latest-news/tyrrqn/picture314067868/alternates/FREE_768/cdc%20flu%20map.png" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.idahostatesman.com/public/latest-news/tyrrqn/picture314067868/alternates/FREE_640/cdc%20flu%20map.png" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.idahostatesman.com/public/latest-news/tyrrqn/picture314067868/alternates/FREE_480/cdc%20flu%20map.png" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.idahostatesman.com/public/latest-news/tyrrqn/picture314067868/alternates/FREE_1140/cdc%20flu%20map.png" alt="The CDC’s weekly flu tracker shows a “high level” of flu activity in Idaho." title="cdc flu map.png" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                                        &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            The CDC’s weekly flu tracker shows a “high level” of flu activity in Idaho.                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;span class="credit"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;                                                            &lt;/figcaption&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Luke’s Health System told the Idaho Statesman that it’s primarily seeing cases of influenza A in the regions that it serves, which include the Treasure, Magic and Wood River valleys plus Mountain Home, McCall and Fruitland. Infections began rising sharply in early December, spokesperson Christine Myron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several pediatric patients with influenza and respiratory symptoms have been admitted to St. Luke’s Children’s Hospital in Boise, Myron said Tuesday by email. Infections typically peak in January, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Providers report that the flu vaccine is helping reduce the severity of illness among those who do become infected,” Myron said. “In contrast, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to experience high fevers and significantly elevated heart rates. Clinics are also noting increased gastrointestinal symptoms and dizziness, features that differ somewhat from what we’ve seen in recent flu seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="10" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Public health experts say it’s not too late to get the vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu, or influenza, is caused by flu viruses, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The viruses spread through &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html"&gt;tiny droplets&lt;/a&gt; made when people with the flu cough, sneeze or talk. The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby, the CDC says. People can also get sick after touching a contaminated surface and then touching their own mouths, noses or even eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says that &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/index.html#:~:text=Other%20preventive%20actions%20include:%20*%20Avoiding%20close,are%20sick%20*%20Prevent%20serious%20flu%20complications"&gt;wearing a mask&lt;/a&gt; can help an infected person reduce the spread of the virus to others and help protect wearers from breathing in virus droplets from people around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu symptoms include cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, headaches, muscle or body aches, fatigue, and fever or chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many people recover within a few days, the flu can lead to serious complications and even death. Central District Health, which covers Ada County, reported last week the third flu-related death in Idaho this season. The woman who died was in her 90s and lived in the Boise area, according to a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Christine Hahn, medical director at the Idaho Division of Public Health, said it’s not too late to get the flu vaccine, which is available at pharmacies, doctors’ offices and local &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/health-wellness/community-health/public-health-districts"&gt;public health districts&lt;/a&gt;. Most insurance providers will cover it, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine is available to Idaho children under the age of 19 at &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/services-programs/children-families-older-adults/child-and-adolescent-immunization"&gt;no cost&lt;/a&gt; or a significantly reduced cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It keeps people from getting really sick with the flu in many cases, and that’s really what we want that flu vaccine to do, is keep people out of the hospital, keep people out of the emergency department, keep people from feeling so sick that they’re going to miss a week or more of work or school,” Hahn said Tuesday by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine is also available in the form of a nasal spray, under the brand name FluMist, which is now available to order and administer at home. The FDA approved its &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-nasal-spray-influenza-vaccine-self-or-caregiver-administration"&gt;self-administered use&lt;/a&gt; in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-109" class="zone zone-el" index="20" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Flu season is ‘peaking right now,’ medical director says&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hahn said that she worries the area will see another surge among kids after they head back to school following the winter break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t feel like the flu season is over,” Hahn said. “It’s not behind us. It’s definitely peaking right now, and it’s still worth getting the vaccine. And of course, just staying healthy in all the other ways that you can to protect yourself, like getting enough rest, eating healthy, washing your hands, staying away from other people who are sick, that kind of stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do get a bad case of the flu, especially for elderly or immunocompromised people, there are &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/antiviral-drugs.html"&gt;antiviral medications&lt;/a&gt; that can help, Hahn said. She encourages people to call their health care provider ahead of time to check eligibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-110" class="zone zone-el" index="24" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary Health said in its release that patients who catch symptoms early may qualify for the treatment after being tested and evaluated in urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That can really nip it in the bud,” Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;  &lt;h5&gt; Read Next &lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;div class="grid"&gt;    &lt;article class="package"&gt;                  &lt;p class="time"&gt;        December 30, 2025 3:48 PM      &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/article&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;  &lt;h5&gt; Read Next &lt;/h5&gt;  &lt;div class="grid"&gt;    &lt;article class="package"&gt;                  &lt;p class="time"&gt;        December 30, 2025 1:52 PM      &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/article&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

Yet, in the absence of a better plan, it happens with depressing ease. How we spend the hours between shutting down the laptop and slipping under the duvet affects sleep quality, mood and how restored we feel the next day. So, how can we reclaim those lost evenings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to Jason Ellis, a professor of psychology at Northumbria University and director of the Northumbria centre for sleep research, establishing a regular end-of-day routine sends a signal to your brain that you are making a shift between work mode, and rest and recreation. “It’s about putting the day to bed before you go to bed,” he says. Gretchen Rubin – an author, podcaster and creator of the Happiness Project – agrees. “Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Rubin’s working day is finished, she spends a few minutes tidying up and rewriting her to-do list. Then she gets out her watercolours and paints for a while, although she says the activity itself isn’t important. “It could be going for a walk, or playing with your dog; the important thing is that it marks the transition between work and free time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Unsurprisingly, staring at YouTube on your phone is probably not the ideal transition. Rubin recommends turning your phone off for an hour or so after work, or placing it somewhere inconvenient to reach. “It keeps the brain stimulated and alert, similar to the work mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Much has been made of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/oct/01/should-i-worry-about-blue-light" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;detrimental effect of blue light &lt;/a&gt;– emitted by phones, laptops, game consoles and other screens – on sleep. However, Ellis says the notion that blue light is “bad” is “a little too simplistic. Research is now focusing on the combined effect of blue light and what you are actually doing on your blue-light-emitting devices.” This means distinguishing between “active” blue light, associated with checking emails or social media, and “passive”, from reading, watching or listening to something on your device. “The former should be avoided in the two hours before bedtime, but the latter is fine during that time window.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Contrary to what you might assume, a lit room is actually better than a dim one when looking at your phone in the evening. This is because a brightly lit device held close to your face in an otherwise darkened room delivers more light to the retina (because your pupils are dilated), which has a larger potential to suppress melatonin than the same device used in a well-lit room. Try to avoid fluorescent or LED lights, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;TVs emit blue light too, but the distance from your face renders the effect insignificant compared with a phone or tablet. Although Rubin warns that TV can suck up your time in just as unsatisfactory a manner as social media. “Make sure your viewing is an intentional activity, not just mindless channel flicking,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whatever your chosen evening entertainment, don’t get too comfortable. The average person sits in chairs for nine to 10 hours a day, and while some of this sitting time is unavoidable – desks, meeting rooms, vehicles – at home, you have more flexibility. Katy Bowman, a biomechanist and author of Rethink Your Position, recommends taking the floor. “Sitting on the floor encourages your body to cycle through many different positions, rather than the one or two that a sofa encourages us to sit in,” she says. You can use a cushion or two at first. If floor-sitting isn’t an option, at least try to avoid taking root in your comfy chair. Researchers at the University of Leicester recommend five minutes of movement for every 30 minutes of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3388f742-454e-4b19-9ddd-e2a31ab263cb" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Mark the transition between work and free time by regularly doing an activity such as painting.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When I read Haruki Murakami’s novel Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki, I was inspired by the protagonist’s habit of taking a shower when he got home from work. I had formerly regarded showers as a morning wake-up activity, but the post-work shower was a revelation – providing a metaphorical washing away of the stresses of the day and a clear transition point from day to evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Science suggests baths are even better. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6011066/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Japanese randomised trial&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 found that bathing beat showering on measures including mood, fatigue and stress, as well as on ratings of aches and pains. Ellis gives baths the preferential thumbs up when it comes to sleep, too. “Research on sleep onset latency – how quickly we get off to sleep – shows that a shower is OK, a 20-minute bath is better but a longer soak is best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two of the main regulators of the sleep-wake cycle are core body temperature and melatonin levels, which are governed by circadian rhythms. In the evening, core body temperature begins to drop as melatonin rises, inducing natural sleepiness. “When you lie in a hot bath, body heat is transferred from the core to the periphery where it is lost, which signals to the brain that it is time to prepare for sleep,” Ellis says. Apparently, adding bubble bath serves a practical purpose too: it insulates the water, enhancing the cooling effect afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I lost the post-work shower habit when I started working from home. Now, my go-to post-work activity is typically CrossFit or a 10km run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Traditional advice has always warned against working up a sweat too close to bedtime, though this hasn’t been well supported by recent evidence. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30374942/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2019 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; concluded that, for most people, evening exercise does not impair sleep and may even improve it – with the exception of high-intensity workouts performed within an hour of bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A large &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;real-world study from Monash University&lt;/a&gt; in Australia earlier this year has shed new light on the issue. “We found that strenuous exercise performed within four hours of bedtime was associated with delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality,” says the lead author Dr Josh Leota, from the school of psychological sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Exercise activates the sympathetic nervous system, associated with alertness. The parasympathetic system is reactivated afterwards, which returns the body to a resting state (and is related to sleep onset). But, Leota explains, very strenuous exercise can slow this reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:16,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:6060,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;how-to-have-a-better-day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Sign up to our 16-part series and get expert advice on how to improve your life - from morning to night&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;How to have a better day&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Twice weekly, for eight weeks&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;You're signed up to How to have a better day.&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;features&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He recommends doing strenuous workouts earlier. “Our findings suggest that as long as a workout is finished at least four hours before bedtime, it has no effect on sleep, regardless of how long or strenuous it is,” he says. “If you do exercise later in the evening, keep it on the lighter side – such as an easy jog or a brief swim.” Evening exercise can also expose you to bright light and stimulation, he adds, “at a time when your system should be winding down”. That said, these things can be highly individual. “It is worth experimenting with timing, and monitoring your recovery,” says Leota, “rather than assuming what works for one person applies to everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whether you’ve been soaking in the bath, painting watercolours or running laps, eating is an integral part of the evening routine. The emerging field of chrono-nutrition explores how the timing and composition of dietary intake interacts with circadian rhythms. “When you eat, not just what you eat, is increasingly being shown to play an important role in sleep,” says Dr Samantha Gill, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings with regard to the evening meal are somewhat inconclusive, however. A large-scale cross-sectional study published in the British Journal of Nutrition in 2021 supported the popular belief that eating too close to bedtime is detrimental to sleep – linking it to more interrupted sleep – though other studies have found no negative impact. “While experimental and observational research indicates that certain nutrients and dietary patterns can influence sleep outcomes, what’s missing are randomised controlled trials that use objective measures of both diet and sleep to provide clear insights into cause and effect,” says Gill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She recommends eating around three hours before going to bed as a sensible aim, but concedes “the ‘best’ time to eat dinner likely varies from person to person. The key message is to not go to bed too full or too hungry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="89683ff0-8913-46c8-9fe8-2107d2123113" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How to optimise the cognitive benefits of dreams and sleep","elementId":"89683ff0-8913-46c8-9fe8-2107d2123113","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/12/how-to-optimise-the-cognitive-benefits-of-dreams-and-sleep"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not only the evening meal that can have an effect on sleep. “It’s helpful to consider what you’re consuming throughout the whole day.” Caffeine and alcohol are two of the most obvious – and well-researched – sleep-hampering substances, but one small study reported that a diet low in fibre and high in saturated fat and sugar was associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Whereas, Gill says, “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9930787/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Higher dietary fibre&lt;/a&gt; and protein intakes have been linked to improved sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Given the importance of melatonin in the sleep-wake cycle, it is not surprising that foods that contain it have been found to enhance aspects of sleep. Many of the interventional studies (those that add something into the diet to test its effect) have used tart cherry juice or supplementation, which, while effective, is expensive and hard to source. Ellis has a budget-friendly solution: “Eating two kiwi fruits an hour before bedtime has been shown to reduce sleep onset latency and improve sleep duration,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dietary sources of tryptophan (which include dairy, eggs, fish, chicken and turkey, as well as nuts, seeds and legumes) also appear to improve sleep outcomes, says Gill. Milk’s tryptophan content is one of the reasons a warm milky drink is such a good sleep promoter. However, the cultural aspect (we associate such drinks with bedtime) and habituation also play a role. “If a hot milky drink is part of someone’s usual going-to-bed regime, it signals to the brain to prepare for sleep,” says Ellis, who prefers a mug of decaf tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Which brings us back to the importance both of routine – the brain’s comfort blanket – and individuality. “It’s great to know what the research says about when we should eat, exercise, work or bathe, but we must also pay attention to our own responses,” says Rubin. “There is no single perfect evening routine, there is only your perfect evening routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPakZiZ0Q1ZS0zWV9tVlB1MGFzdGhid1BpNWJHckZiek1QUVg4NnVrd0VQeGdJN1dtWGl2SlRZYjlRbU9ocXpOMXBKaHhpcGRuWVdfMk1iT3FNeFNnMkpkUEZiN0Y3bm1TZ3RhREFSRmRuQVRabkVzcmlJaUwzeUpKT0x2cTV4RXgtOS1iU2JMQmF5d2tsYVFUcDVHSUJtbUJncURlOU40ckd3QmVOQU9qUUVrOTI4RHJfSHJlSHZVS1lvQkVQRWFz</guid></item><item><title>您的一些细胞在遗传上不是您的—它们能告诉我们有关生死的什么？ -自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04102-4</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hidden Guests: Migrating Cells and How the New Science of Microchimerism is Redefining Human Identity&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lise Barnéoud, transl.

Humans are also chimaeras — thanks to the presence of cells that are not our own inside our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00664-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04102-4/d41586-025-04102-4_15735870.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Could baby’s first bacteria take root before birth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mothers carry cells that came from their biological children, passed across the placenta when the baby was in the womb. Likewise, children carry cells that were transferred to them &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; from their mothers — some of which might even be from the child’s maternal grandmothers, older siblings or twin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These ‘microchimeric’ cells have been found in every organ that has been studied so far. But they are also rare — much rarer, for example, than the trillions of microorganisms that reside &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00194-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00194-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;in our guts&lt;/a&gt;, on our skin and in many other organs. We carry only one microchimeric cell for every 10,000 to 1 million of our own cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hidden Guests&lt;/i&gt;, the author invites readers to learn about the pioneering “microchimerists” — scientists who discovered these fascinating shared cells. She also challenges us to consider the broader implications for health and science, and the philosophy of the fact that we are all chimaeras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unplanned discovery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microchimeric cells were, we learn, discovered through a series of accidental observations. In the late 1800s, pathologist Georg Schmorl described ‘giant cells’ in the lungs of people who had died from &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03029-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03029-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;eclampsia&lt;/a&gt; — a life-threatening inflammatory condition that can occur during pregnancy. These giant cells resembled the cells of the placenta, leading Schmorl to suggest that fetal cells passing into the bloodstream of mothers was the norm, rather than the exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-025-03291-2/index.html" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04102-4/d41586-025-04102-4_51751556.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;The probiotic home: where microbes are welcome guests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 1969, a team studying immunity in pregnant people detected white blood cells that contained the Y chromosome in the blood of individuals who would eventually give birth to boys&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For more than two decades, it was presumed that these microchimeric cells were a temporary feature of pregnancy. It wasn’t until 1993 that geneticist Diana Bianchi found cells with Y chromosomes in women who had given birth to sons between one and 27 years earlier&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding overturned the dogma that children inherit genes from their parents and never the other way around — these transferred fetal cells move through the family tree, travelling ‘backwards in time’ from children to their mothers. Bianchi and others would go on to show that these cells have remarkable regenerative properties — promoting wound healing in mothers by transforming into blood vessels or skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Immunological implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microchimerism also calls into question a central tenet of immunology: that the immune system works by classifying cells in a binary fashion, as ‘self’ or ‘non-self’. Under this simplistic model, microchimeric cells should trigger an immune response and be rejected by the body — but they do not. Barnéoud challenges readers to consider whether forcing microchimerism-related discrepancies to fit into existing immunological rules is appropriate, instead of allowing these cells to influence new immunological rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At around the same time that Bianchi was making her groundbreaking discovery, rheumatologist Lee Nelson also found Y-chromosome-containing cells in people who had previously given birth to sons&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Nelson was studying autoimmune diseases, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01836-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01836-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;disproportionately affect middle-aged women&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time were thought to be caused by hormone imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04102-4/d41586-025-04102-4_51821572.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04102-4/d41586-025-04102-4_51821572.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Black mum carrying baby on her back in a sling while waiting in a crowd." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04102-4/d41586-025-04102-4_51821572.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Cells pass from mother to baby, and vice versa, across the placenta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Jeffrey Davis/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials say flu activity on Virginia’s Eastern Shore has increased sharply over the past two weeks, disrupting some holiday plans and prompting renewed calls for prevention measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eastern Shore District Supervisor Jon Richardson said flu cases have risen locally and statewide, a pattern he noted is typical for this time of year. Richardson said recent testing shows most positive cases on the Shore are influenza A, and both flu-related illnesses and emergency department visits are trending upward. He added that the region’s respiratory illness activity level has moved from “low” to “high” in just the past week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Richardson said the increase has been felt even within his own household and among staff at the local health department, several of whom have been out sick over the past two weeks. He encouraged residents to take precautions, including getting the annual flu vaccine after consulting with a medical provider, practicing good hand hygiene, covering coughs, cleaning frequently touched surfaces, and avoiding close contact with others when sick. He also advised people at higher risk for flu-related complications to contact a medical provider early, as antiviral medications may be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Virginia Department of Health, COVID-19 case levels across the Commonwealth have remained relatively stable as flu activity continues to rise. Health officials say staying informed and taking basic preventive steps can help reduce the spread of seasonal illness on the Eastern Shore.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;One September day earlier this year, Natalie Cook brought her 2-year-old foster daughter to the park. Like most kids, Cook's daughter loves going down the slides and riding the swings. For Cook, however, these outings can be stressful. Her foster daughter was born prematurely, and she uses a walker to get around.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I never know how the kids are going to react with her walker," Cook said. "Some kids will run off with [it], or they just stare at her."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On this particular outing, things were going well. Cook's daughter was going from one piece of equipment to another, having a nice time. After a few minutes, a boy approached and asked, "what's wrong with her?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I froze," Cook recalled. "I wasn't sure how to explain her disability to an adult, let alone a child."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cook explained that her daughter had been born much smaller than other babies, and that it's taking some time for her to catch up with other kids her age. Satisfied with Cook's answer, the little boy ran off to play with his friends. But after a few more minutes, he returned and began playing with Cook's daughter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He was pushing her on the swing, and then he started to even pick up on the sign language I was using to ask her if she wanted to 'keep swinging' or to '[be] done.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Soon, the boy had convinced his friends to come over and join.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He started telling them about her disability and what she &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do, not what she couldn't do," Cook said, laughing. "He was like a proud little mom."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before she knew it, the whole park was cheering Cook's daughter along. Seemingly everyone there picked up on the sign language and helped her navigate the playground equipment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was just in awe because I've never seen anything like this at the park. And my heart was just so, so full," Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"[The little boy] saw past her disability. She was just another kid to him, and he could include her in his day. It was just a really sweet moment to know there's still kids out there like that, and [that] my daughter's going to be in good hands as she gets older."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/myunsunghero/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Unsung Hero is also a podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — new episodes are released every Tuesday.
