The statement did not include information about identity of the recipient or the type of organ that was transplanted. The donor was not a resident of Michigan or Ohio, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sutfin said the Michigan and Ohio health departments "worked closely" together and with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the investigation into the patient's death. The CDC's Rabies Laboratory confirmed the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Health officials worked together to ensure that people, including health care providers, who were in contact with the Michigan individual were assessed for possible exposure to rabies," the statement added. "Post exposure preventive care, if appropriate, has been provided."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The department declined to provide NBC News with additional information. Ohio’s Health Department and the CDC did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Rabies can spread to humans if they come into contact with saliva or blood from infected animals, such as bats, raccoons, skunks or stray dogs. It is not always clear right away that a person has contracted rabies, as the initial symptoms are similar to those of the flu, including fever, headache and nausea. As the illness progresses, patients then experience difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation and hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If a person does not seek medical care quickly after having been scratched or bitten by a potentially infected animal, rabies is fatal. Before 1960, several hundred people died of it each year, but the annual number has shrunk to fewer than 10 in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Potential organ donors in the United States are screened for viruses, bacteria and other infections; however, rabies is not usually among those tests, in part because the test for it takes too long and because the infection is so rare in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A patient who received a kidney transplant in 2013 similarly &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/patient-killed-rabies-organ-transplant-cdc-says-flna1c8881313" target="_blank"&gt;died after &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/patient-killed-rabies-organ-transplant-cdc-says-flna1c8881313" target="_blank"&gt;having &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/patient-killed-rabies-organ-transplant-cdc-says-flna1c8881313" target="_blank"&gt;contract&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/patient-killed-rabies-organ-transplant-cdc-says-flna1c8881313" target="_blank"&gt;ed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/patient-killed-rabies-organ-transplant-cdc-says-flna1c8881313" target="_blank"&gt; rabies through the organ&lt;/a&gt;. The donor was found to have died of rabies in Florida, but the cause of death was discovered only after an investigation into the recipient’s death. Three other patients also received organs from the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;In 2004, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fourth-rabies-death-organ-transplant-flna1c9475288" target="_blank"&gt;three &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fourth-rabies-death-organ-transplant-flna1c9475288" target="_blank"&gt;transplant &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fourth-rabies-death-organ-transplant-flna1c9475288" target="_blank"&gt;recipients died of rabies&lt;/a&gt; after they received organs from an infected donor in Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;div class="expanded-byline-contributors articleBylineContainer"&gt;&lt;div class="expanded-byline article-expanded-byline" data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"&gt;&lt;span class="byline-name expanded-byline__name" data-testid="byline-name"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/randi-richardson-ncpn1246797"&gt;Randi Richardson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="byline-social expanded-byline__social"&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/RandiRichTV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="byline-social--link"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:randi.richardson@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="byline-social--link"&gt;&lt;span class="icon icon-email"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="expanded-byline__bio-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="byline-bio expanded-byline__bio"&gt;Randi Richardson is a health intern with NBC News Digital based in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="expanded-contributors"&gt;Karen Cortes contributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 01:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNU25ZeXZXcFplY0NQT3hWUGdSLXNQckhMLXJubXc0NnRtZnNpbGlmR3M3QWR4Yzdycnk5ZE9tWHJLYjVYRlNqX2FoM0ZlY2U4UnZYMVhsQXFPT25MSGx3MUJIZWExQ25sU3lvVEpSc1RyN1NBVHV3S2VmOUFpakpXWnZjSncxNGhrMmxiU1YwZk56N0RFRmxB</guid></item><item><title>Some measles patients in West Texas show signs of vitamin A toxicity, doctors say, raising concerns about misinformation - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQSk5EcFAzOFVkQjZUamlQeHhxel9IbFVraTVaaWVCRTFtd2JQdFNWVTF5T1RvOG0wQVFmTkdfTldvWXg3LTcydE1OaGlYSmRtMVkzelltV1BKbGNzR0wwNXhrX2stRWJsbzYzTlFGaVl5c1BybXh6N0RvUVFVTnlzU2dIYnBMc0k50gF_QVVfeXFMTUROLTVGZEZzOV84RmZuTFI5c3dfNTJJb2lpY0tocmlqUVdDNVhFUU9ZcGFucmxmTXBrSGU2dXlBS0xPaFZ1dFVjcEJKd0dORWh5U1MyUGpSRGtxREYxcHpxLWM4azNoOXZNT0NwUDFka180NFplY0h4OHVKb25qcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qj34s700003b5vzmnirdas@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors treating people hospitalized as part of a measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico have also found themselves facing another problem: vitamin A toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001k3b5vzzwah72n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, near the outbreak’s epicenter, several patients have been found to have abnormal liver function on routine lab tests, a probable sign that they’ve taken too much of the vitamin, according to Dr. Lara Johnson, pediatric hospitalist and chief medical officer for Covenant Health-Lubbock Service Area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001l3b5ven91tduv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hospitalized children with the toxicity were all unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001m3b5v9umqsj4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has centered his response to the outbreak on vitamin A, even suggesting in a Fox News interview that it could work “as a prophylaxis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qkd5p100013b6mudx7nw30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But overuse of vitamin A can have serious health consequences, and there is no evidence that it can prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qkdtes00043b6mvg5xk0y6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent infection with the measles virus is through the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is 97% effective against measles after two doses. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/measles-rfk-vaccine-immunity/index.html"&gt;Kennedy&lt;/a&gt; has said that he does “encourage” vaccination but that it is a “personal choice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001o3b5v57pcx0lk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If people have the mistaken impression that you have an either-or choice of MMR vaccine or vitamin A, you’re going to get a lot of kids unnecessarily infected with measles. That’s a problem, especially during an epidemic,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. “And second, you have this unregulated medicine in terms of doses being given and potential toxicities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001p3b5vsx0xfbha@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In specific doses taken under the care of a physician, vitamin A can play a role in treatment for measles. That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; recommend it in serious cases. But the patients who were reported to have toxicity were probably not taking the vitamin under the supervision of a physician, Johnson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001q3b5vmmo3s2ju@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vitamin A is most useful for measles support in people who have a specific deficiency, and studies suggesting its use mainly draw on evidence from low-income countries where that deficiency is common. The patients in West Texas are generally well-nourished, said Dr. Lesley Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, so experts say it’s unclear how beneficial the vitamin might be in this setting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001r3b5vuqi9a2kr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vitamin A has an important role in &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-a/art-20365945" target="_blank"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt; and vision. It’s fat-soluble, so when someone takes too much, it can &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;accumulate&lt;/a&gt; in organs like the liver. &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-a/art-20365945" target="_blank"&gt;Excess vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; can cause dry skin and eyes, blurry vision, bone thinning, skin irritation, liver damage and other serious issues. In pregnant women, excess vitamin A can lead to birth defects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001s3b5vr635w23f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients with toxicity can receive supportive care like fluids for low blood pressure or moisturizers for dry skin and eyes, Motheral said. But more serious damage will need to be evaluated and given further management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001t3b5vm2bz4bui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Recovery for patients with acute toxicity can be rapid when the vitamin is discontinued,” she said. “Chronic toxicity can affect bones, brain and of course the liver. … Sadly, some of the more serious problems with vitamin A toxicity are not always reversible.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001u3b5vgo7p8dng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association for dietary supplement and functional food manufacturers, issued a &lt;a href="https://www.crnusa.org/newsroom/crn-cautions-against-misuse-vitamin-measles-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday warning parents against using high doses of vitamin A to try to keep their children from getting measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001v3b5v1yosfhag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While vitamin A plays an important role in supporting overall immune function, research hasn’t established its effectiveness in preventing measles infection. CRN is concerned about reports of high-dose vitamin A being used inappropriately, especially in children,” the statement says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001w3b5vn27spbwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Johnson said she has seen people who were taking vitamin A for measles treatment as well as for prevention. She doesn’t know exactly where these patients heard that they should be taking a lot of vitamin A, she said, but the approach is heavily discussed on social media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001x3b5ven8sq0dd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s coming out of the health and wellness … influencer industry that downplays the importance of vaccines and tries to promote various spectacular cures like ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or vitamin A,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001y3b5v8ayrjn9d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ivermectin, a deworming medication, and hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, were both incorrectly touted as treatments for the Covid-19 pandemic but resulted in many &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/ivermectin-covid-19-warning-injuries/index.html"&gt;poison control reports&lt;/a&gt; and an estimated $&lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2024.00452?utm_campaign=march+2025+issue&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--1UtwuwdFSFcDhgrRowAjYInCOkvC-i1aM4HIyHQqK2P6fRHtXwrzzgWqPwFKWCQc7WDkHUi6lYzxahogkIm0B-x8KvA&amp;amp;_hsmi=348087923&amp;amp;utm_content=ahead+of+print&amp;amp;utm_source=hat&amp;amp;journalCode=hlthaff" target="_blank"&gt;200 million in unnecessary spending&lt;/a&gt;. Experts worry that the drug misinformation so rampant during Covid could mirror rhetoric about vitamin A for measles prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry001z3b5vynwq3cf1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his Fox News interview, Kennedy endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A. He praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry00203b5vsts0cvsa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The antibiotic, clarithromycin, could be an attempt to prevent secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia, but&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7055587/" target="_blank"&gt; evidence&lt;/a&gt; for that is limited. Budesonide is a steroid with a variety of uses, but it’s not clear whether or how it might help someone with measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8qk9cry00213b5v5c05s29t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles outbreak has now affected at least 379 people across Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Kansas has reported 23 measles cases, and officials said Wednesday that they may also be linked to the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cases in Kansas are likely part of the mushrooming outbreak that began in West Texas in late January. On March 13, Kansas reported a single measles case, the first the state had seen since 2018. The nine cases reported last week had ties to that original case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spreading infections and misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, KDHE Communications Director Jill Bronaugh told Ars Technica over email that the department has found a genetic link between the first Kansas case and the cases in West Texas, which has similarly spread swiftly in under-vaccinated communities and also spilled over to New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While genetic sequencing of the first Kansas case reported is consistent with an epidemiological link to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the source of exposure is still unknown," Bronaugh told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bronaugh added that KDHE, along with local health departments, is continuing to work to track down people who may have been exposed to measles in affected counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;In Texas&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, the latest outbreak count has hit 327 across 15 counties, mostly children and almost entirely unvaccinated. Forty cases have been hospitalized, and one death has been reported—a 6-year-old unvaccinated girl who had no underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that as measles continues to spread, parents have continued to eschew vaccines and instead &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;embraced "alternative" treatments, including vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, which has been touted by anti-vaccine advocate and current US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Vitamin A accumulates in the body and can be toxic with large doses or extended use. Texas doctors told the Times that they've now treated a handful of unvaccinated children who had been given so much vitamin A that they had signs of liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I had a patient that was only sick a couple of days, four or five days, but had been taking it for like three weeks," one doctor told the Times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;In New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, cases are up to 43, with two hospitalizations and one death in an unvaccinated adult who did not seek medical care. &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html"&gt;In Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;, officials have identified nine cases, with no hospitalizations or deaths so far.&lt;/p&gt;

Nanoplastics measure less than 1 micrometer, while microplastics range from 1 to 5000 micrometers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny plastics mostly originate from household items, packaging materials, and even clothing fibers that wash into rivers and lakes. Unfortunately, standard water treatment systems often struggle to remove these minuscule particles, especially &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/natural-solution-successfully-removes-98-of-nanoplastics-from-water/"&gt;nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Graphical abstract of the study.

(CREDIT: ACS Publications) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies highlight how widespread this contamination is. Researchers analyzed 159 tap water samples from 14 countries. They discovered nano- and microplastics in nearly 81% of these samples, with common plastics like polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene dominating the mix. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you drink this water, plastic particles may accumulate in your body tissues, potentially causing health problems. Researchers have linked these plastics to changes in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discover-new-link-between-gut-bacteria-and-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, insulin resistance, and liver disorders, though scientists are still investigating their long-term impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_surprising_power_of_boiling_water"&gt;The Surprising Power of Boiling Water&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asian countries like China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, people traditionally boil tap water before drinking it. Boiling water was initially practiced to eliminate harmful bacteria and chemicals. However, new research reveals an additional benefit: boiling water can trap and remove plastic particles from tap water effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from &lt;a href="https://en.gzhmu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Guangzhou Medical University&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://english.jnu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jinan University&lt;/a&gt; in China recently tested this theory. They took tap water samples containing known amounts of nano- and microplastics, then boiled them for five minutes. After letting the water cool for ten minutes, they filtered it through a standard coffee filter or a stainless-steel tea strainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Boiling hard water, which contains high levels of calcium and magnesium minerals, dramatically reduced the plastic particles. When water is boiled, these minerals create a white crust called calcium carbonate, or limescale, often seen inside kettles and pots. This limescale effectively traps plastic particles, allowing them to be filtered out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers observed an impressive removal rate. For water containing 180 milligrams of calcium carbonate per liter, boiling and filtering removed about 84% of the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-develop-plant-based-biodegradable-microplastics/"&gt;plastic particles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, water with higher mineral content (around 300 milligrams per liter) saw a removal rate of up to 90%. Soft water, containing fewer minerals, still benefited—boiling and filtering removed about 25% of the plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images of reference NP (Reference) and incrustants began to grow on NP surface and finally encapsulated NP at 25–100 °C.

According to the researchers, the secret lies in how heat affects calcium carbonate. When water heats up, calcium carbonate molecules start bonding together, forming solid crystals. These crystals attach to the surface of plastic particles, encapsulating them completely. As the water cools, these crystals sink, dragging the plastic down with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This simple boiling-water strategy can 'decontaminate' NMPs from household tap water and has the potential for harmlessly alleviating human intake of NMPs through &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fog-harvesting-could-be-the-answer-for-water-starved-cities-around-the-world/"&gt;water consumption&lt;/a&gt;," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also confirmed that the process works for both nanoplastics (extremely small particles) and larger microplastics. Using fluorescent polystyrene microspheres as test particles, they clearly observed how plastic particles got trapped within calcium carbonate crystals. Additional tests with plastics like polyethylene and polypropylene, aged under sunlight to mimic environmental conditions, showed similar promising results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Influence factors on the formation of nanoplastic (NP) and incrustant coprecipitates at different temperatures.

Most homes already have the tools needed: a pot, kettle, or stove, and a simple strainer. Researchers emphasized using metal or glass containers instead of plastic to boil water, as heated plastic may release harmful chemicals like bisphenol or antimony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While boiling water significantly reduces nano- and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-create-recyclable-alternative-to-durable-plastics/"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, its effectiveness can differ depending on local water hardness. Areas with hard water benefit the most, but even soft water sees meaningful improvement. The researchers suggest boiling and filtering your water regularly to ensure consistent reduction in plastic exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Drinking boiled water apparently is a viable long-term strategy for reducing global exposure to NMPs," the research team noted.

However, the medical professional who gave her the shot made a dire mistake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the woman was injected with a vaccine for tuberculosis, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14019873/infection-tuberculosis-cold-early-stage.html"&gt;the deadliest infection&lt;/a&gt; in the world, with an estimated 1.2 million deaths each year, resulting in a severe tuberculosis (TB) infection that required six months of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TB vaccine in typically given to babies soon after they are born, making any adverse events more common among that group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe complications of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for TB, particularly in healthy people, are rare, with about one to 10 percent of recipients recorded in the medical literature having experienced them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These complications range from relatively mild - blisters at the injection site and swelling - to life-threatening lesions in the lungs, liver, or spleen, inflamed bones, and widespread infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient, from Ireland, developed an abscess with oozing pus at the site on her arm where she was injected. After weeks of doctors’ struggling to identify the cause, believing at first it was caused by inflamed connective tissue in the skin, they tested the pus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing revealed the woman had TB-causing bacteria in her body, possibly caused by the strain &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-7802171/Cattle-twice-likely-catch-bovine-TB-cattle-badgers.html"&gt;more common in cattle&lt;/a&gt;, which is used in a weakened form to make the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BCG vaccine was incorrectly injected into the muscle, though it should have been administered under the skin. Because the BCG contains bacteria, not viruses like the MMR shot, injecting it into the muscle allowed the bacteria to spread unchecked, leading to infection in the deltoid muscle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;TB typically causes a lung infection, but in this case, the otherwise healthy patient developed swelling in her arm as a result of the incorrect vaccine being administered in the wrong way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Administration of the BCG vaccine intramuscularly is commonly the result of an error and can lead to rare and preventable complications, even in immunocompetent patients,’ doctors who reported the case said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A reasonable explanation for the error in this case is that the healthcare professional administering the vaccine confused the [the TB vaccine] for the MMR vaccine.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person who administered the BCG vaccine did so in the way that an MMR vaccine is meant to be administered – via injection at the muscle level because the weakened forms of the viruses replicate slowly there, prompting a stronger immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TB vaccine, which contains a weakened form of the bacteria Mycobacterium bovis, is meant to be injected just below the skin, which triggers a local immune reponse where the bacteria can stimulate immunity without spreading to other parts of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Viruses used to make vaccines like the MMR replicate inside cells when injected into the muscle, but the bacteria used to make the BCG vaccine is more easily controlled when administrered under the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When injected into the muscle, the bacteria was allowed to spread more easily&lt;span&gt; into the deltoid muscle, where the immune system could not stop the TB-causing bacteria from spreading unchecked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This led to an abscess in the 30-year-old's arm, which doctors still say is a rare occurrence ‘primarily in the pediatric population.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The adverse effects doctors are likely to see include injection-site abscess, inflammation of the lymph nodes, chronic bone pain and mobility problems, and a body-wide infection causing fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver, severe cough, arthritis, particularly in immunocompromised patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The healthy 30-year-old patient was mistakenly given the vaccine for TB, which was injected improperly, resulting in a whole-body infection and a fluid-filled abscess in her deltoid muscle, indicated by the arrow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman was treated with a variety of anti-TB medications, which were effective, ‘and she recovered fully and reported no further symptoms 6 months after initiation of the anti-tuberculosis treatment,’ the doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three months later, her abscess had shrunken considerably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said her case was highly unusual. Typically, complications – already rare – are seen in babies and young children, generally those who are immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This patient, though, ‘was a healthy immunocompetent adult, in contrast to the cases in the literature.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their report was published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/946723"&gt;American Journal of Case Reports&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Injection errors are &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989021/#:~:text=Short%20abstract,measures%20is%20of%20great%20importance."&gt;the main culprit&lt;/a&gt; and the most common causes of such a severe reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NIH published the case of an eight-month-old girl who, at birth, received the tuberculosis vaccine in her thigh muscle instead of into her skin as it was meant to be administered.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She developed swelling at the spot where she was injected, and the mass there grew bigger and bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors drained it and tested the liquid inside, finding it was an infection caused by Mycobacterium bovis, which grew slowly in the muscle over time, forming an abscess under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Localized abscesses are not typically deadly, though if they go untreated, allowing the infection to spread throughout the body, they can become deadly up to 80 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, a Japanese man lay motionless, paralyzed from the neck down after a devastating spinal cord injury. Doctors doubted he would ever stand again. Today, he can not only stand independently but is learning to walk once more, thanks to an injection of laboratory-grown stem cells into his spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Keio University in Tokyo treated four fully paralyzed patients using neural &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/stem-cells-reverse-womans-type-1-diabetes/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; derived from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"&gt;induced pluripotent stem cells&lt;/a&gt; (iPS). Remarkably, half of the patients showed significant improvements. One can now stand, while the other can move his arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s a great positive outcome. It’s very exciting for the field,” &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00863-0"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; James St John, a translational neuroscientist at Griffith University in the Gold Coast, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial began cautiously in December 2021, led by stem-cell scientist Hideyuki Okano and orthopedic surgeon Masaya Nakamura. The team transplanted approximately two million neural precursor cells into each patient’s spinal cord injury site. These cells, created from donor-derived iPS cells — adult cells reprogrammed to behave like embryonic stem cells — can develop into neurons and supporting glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All four participants were men treated two to four weeks after their injuries. They received immune-suppressing medication for six months to ensure their bodies wouldn’t reject the cells. One year later, the researchers assessed their progress using the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS), which ranks impairment from A (complete paralysis) to E (normal function).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, all four patients were classified as grade A — completely paralyzed. But one patient dramatically improved to grade D, able to stand independently. He now actively trains to walk again. Another improved to grade C, regaining partial movement in arms and legs. Even the two patients who remained at grade A demonstrated subtle motor improvements, such as being able to feed themselves — a huge step up for quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a dramatic recovery,” Okano told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from one patient provided clues about the mechanics at play in these recoveries. A previously hollow, damaged spinal region had filled with new tissue within a year. &lt;a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/science-nature/science/20250322-244660/"&gt;According to Prof. Toru Ogata&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Tokyo, “It’s possible that the transplanted cells have engrafted and are increasing the number of nerves.” Ogata calls the outcome “groundbreaking,” especially given the severe initial condition of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cautious-optimism-and-challenges-ahead"&gt;Cautious Optimism and Challenges Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these results sound extraordinary, the Japanese scientists remain cautious. The study involved only four patients, too small a number to establish definitive effectiveness. Spontaneous recovery sometimes occurs naturally in spinal cord injury patients, though dramatic improvements like those seen in this trial are exceedingly rare. It sounds preposterous that the results may be owed to chance, but new trials involving more people will settle many things. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the major differences in patient outcomes are something to carefully consider. The reasons for these differences remain unclear, though severity and specific nature of injury likely are involved. Each spinal cord injury is unique, the researchers added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okano’s startup, K Pharma, aims to initiate new, larger trials soon. They’ll focus on varying injury types and chronic paralysis cases as early as 2027.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prof. Kinichi Nakashima of Kyushu University believes that increasing the number of cells injected may enhance success. “The key will be whether the team can prove the treatment’s efficacy by increasing the number of successful cases,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-leap-forward-for-paralysis-treatment"&gt;A Leap Forward for Paralysis treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Japan alone, about 6,000 new spinal cord injuries occur annually, most often because of traffic accidents. Globally, nearly one million new injuries occur each year, with approximately 20 million people currently living with the devastating effects of spinal paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Makoto Ohama, chairman of the Japan Spinal Cord Foundation and himself affected by spinal injury, reacted with hope. “I feel like I can see a beacon of hope,” he said after hearing the results. For people previously facing a lifetime of dependence, even modest improvements can profoundly transform their lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the delicate art of repairing damaged nerves, this new approach represents not just medical innovation but a powerful leap forward in restoring mobility — and dignity — to thousands waiting for a cure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The results have not yet been peer-reviewed. They were presented at a press conference on 21 March.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy, Jr.'s &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-jr-cod-liver-oil-measles" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;purported measles cure&lt;/a&gt;, alongside cod liver oil, which contains the same vitamin — has led to liver damage and &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1104368-overview?form=fpf" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;yellowed skin&lt;/a&gt; in children infected with measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is 97 percent effective after two doses, most of the scientific evidence surrounding Vitamin A and measles suggests only that it's useful in &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/what-you-should-know-about-measles-and-vitamin-a/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;reducing &lt;em&gt;mortality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rather than infection. As such, it's often administered in low, age-appropriate doses to children hospitalized with the communicable disease — but virtually all doctors insist that it should be used in tandem with, and not as as an alternative to, vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That distinction hasn't stopped Kennedy, the former &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;head of an anti-vaccination nonprofit&lt;/a&gt;, from promoting the supplement as providing an "&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery&lt;/a&gt;" for people infected with measles during a &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt; interview he gave after the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/fact-check-rfk-jr-misleads-on-vitamin-a-unsupported-therapies-for-measles/4129784/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC&lt;/em&gt; affiliate&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia noted, those comments were repeated in at least four other &lt;em&gt;Fox&lt;/em&gt; segments aired on a single day, March 4 — and it seems that the vaccine-skeptical parents in the West Texas community where the outbreak began heard him loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I did not hear anything about Vitamin A until he said it on television," said Katherine Wells, the director of public health in Lubbock, Texas, a town near the center of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems the political scion's endorsement of the supplement also translated to a belief that taking it preventively can help protect children from infection. As the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;notes, taking too much Vitamin A is especially dangerous because, unlike other vitamins, it stays stored in the fat and isn't flushed out in the urine.

Both learned about the matter during recent meetings at the CDC but were not authorized to speak about it publicly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;David Geier, who shows up in the &lt;a href="https://directory.psc.gov/hhsdir/eeKey.asp?Key=69735&amp;amp;Format=Table" target="_blank"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services’ directory&lt;/a&gt; as a “senior data analyst,” will reportedly analyze the data. Geier has repeatedly claimed that vaccines cause autism — a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-vaccines-kennedy-cause-spectrum-rcna180837" target="_blank"&gt;link that’s already been fully debunked&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If this individual is involved, then it draws into immediate question the validity of any analysis that comes out of this work,” said a former CDC official who was told of the plan before recently leaving the agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Richard Besser, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and a former acting CDC director, called Geier a “deeply irresponsible choice” to lead this effort as he has “no medical degree and a long history of pushing discredited theories about vaccines and autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Families affected by autism deserve credible research efforts that explore legitimate potential preventable causes of and treatments for autism,” Besser said in a statement. “They are not helped when our tax dollars and research funds are wasted on rehashing a question that has already been answered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Geier’s hiring was first reported Tuesday evening by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. It was unclear Wednesday whether the plans had since changed. Neither HHS nor Geier responded to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It comes as a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/-worried-getting-worse-texas-measles-outbreak-grows-families-resist-va-rcna196873" target="_blank"&gt;growing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; is spreading in at least three states: Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. As of Wednesday, 377 cases had been confirmed in those states — the vast majority in unvaccinated children in Texas. It’s the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019. Two people have died, including a 6-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier this month, it was reported that the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/cdc-research-debunked-link-vaccines-autism-rcna195499" target="_blank"&gt;CDC would launch a new investigation&lt;/a&gt; looking at possible links between vaccines and autism. Instead, the Department of Health and Human Services, led by longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., requested raw data from the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/vsd/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Safety Datalink&lt;/a&gt; and three other sources. The CDC is part of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;David Geier and his father, Maryland geneticist Dr. Mark Geier, were a pair of researchers known for their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1839225/" target="_blank"&gt;poorly designed and retracted studies&lt;/a&gt; using government safety data that have long-fueled widespread misinformation about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to an account in the 2005 book “&lt;a href="https://thehiddenmystery.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Evidence-of-Harm-Mercury-in-Vaccines-and-the-Autism-Epidemic.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Evidence of Harm&lt;/a&gt;,” then-congressman Dave Weldon — whose nomination for CDC director was abruptly withdrawn two weeks ago — intervened to help the Geiers access the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC-housed dataset containing patient health records. This raw data is available to researchers, but isn’t public because of concerns over privacy, misrepresentation of data, and manpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Geiers claimed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/10/us/federal-panel-hears-testimony-on-vaccinations-and-autism.html" target="_blank"&gt;at an Institute of Medicine panel in 2004&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC data showed vaccines were linked to autism, a claim that was refuted by scientists at the meeting and in scores of published studies since. At the same IOM meeting, a scientist explained how the Geiers’ findings had failed to factor for age — children with more vaccines only appeared to have higher rates of autism because they were older and had more time to be diagnosed. (Children on average are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder &lt;a href="https://nationalautismdatacenter.org/age-of-diagnosis/" target="_blank"&gt;around age 5&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Geiers conducted research from a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/25/science/on-autisms-cause-its-parents-vs-research.html" target="_blank"&gt;makeshift laboratory&lt;/a&gt; in their carpeted wood-paneled suburban Maryland basement; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1839225/" target="_blank"&gt;published several studies&lt;/a&gt;, many of which were retracted; and promoted an unproven treatment for autism that cost families tens of thousands of dollars and included injections of Lupron, a drug used for prostate cancer and early puberty. In children, it’s only approved for precocious puberty and comes with side effects including bone damage, heart issues and seizures. They diagnosed kids with precocious puberty without proper tests and misled parents into thinking they were signing up for an approved autism therapy. &lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/d2425008.222.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;A 2011 Maryland Board of Physicians investigation&lt;/a&gt; found that the Geiers violated standards of care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Mark Geier, who theorized that autism resulted from an interaction between mercury and testosterone, &lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/d2425008.222.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;was stripped&lt;/a&gt; of his medical license by Maryland regulators in 2012. Maryland regulators also disciplined David Geier for practicing medicine without a license. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:56:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxPc0FWTUxaZzNUZnFWaENKeGZVNUlwSEozNHBPNEFKTlpyeUpTaEoxaEpGb3U3MWQ0QWFhbU9pTkhCcjRtSl9TZ0xPZVcxbVduWkdRUGxmT1ZlVHhLenprNzExODZwZzh4a09NRVJiWUJTcVlQR0FjRzVxVDQxd2NyYVV3UG9uajhfRXhvTkljLWNHeDVOMlVGeXY1eUxSbXRXZE93YXZZQzdHbnZES0o0V05LUEJQQjVhd3NfSE1kTDZuZ9IBVkFVX3lxTE54Z0tUSkFRZWVjLVlhV0x4djlPUlZ6elZCYXVYeDVHb3RQa29TbUEwWXN4VlFWVFBxaUN1MDlCcXRIaG8xOUNCaFd2aXdiQ1NkNlQxVmdR</guid></item><item><title>Surgeons transplant genetically modified pig liver into Chinese patient - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNRGhHUUExNUtWdmxPcnhQdmhVQjlTc0dPRVZOWUg5NkF0dXFVdU5zZUFNdUs1aHk4TUZQNjZET0h0M1V0eXE5WkdCc19vV1NST3FGZXU4VGRPcEx2UGtrNUhIUlZHR19xZlNmNU56SlZvV1ZUOUdCS0doV1F4dHhhd2QxMGJUQk5KYzhiX0tRZHpPVG9NcEU1RUh3a3VaR1JHcnJNdmJOWjVTazYzcEN4cTIxQ2tsQTNNT0ww?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A genetically modified pig liver that was transplanted into a brain-dead patient appeared to function successfully inside their body for 10 days, according to the scientists who performed the groundbreaking procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The surgery, at a Chinese hospital last year, is thought to mark the first time a pig liver has been transplanted into a human.

Surgeons in the US and China have transplanted pig &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03794-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00879-y" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/04/24/1246577224/gene-edited-pig-kidney-transplant-nyu" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a thymus gland&lt;/a&gt; into a small number of patients. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/nov/01/pig-heart-transplant-faucette-dies" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Several died within months&lt;/a&gt;, although their severe illness at the outset meant it was unclear whether the transplants were a factor. But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/04/pig-kidney-transplant" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;others have made a good recovery and have left hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The latest procedure was carried out in a 50-year-old man diagnosed with brain death after a severe head injury. The patient’s own liver was intact and, in a surgery that took more than 10 hours, the organ taken from a genetically modified Bama miniature pig was plumbed into his blood supply as an additional liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The pig had six genetic modifications aimed at preventing immune rejection. These included deactivating genes that contribute to the production of sugars on the surface of pig cells, which the human immune system attacks, and introducing genes that express human proteins to “humanise” the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;After the transplant, the pig liver showed signs of functioning, including producing bile, which helps break down fats in the digestive system, and porcine albumin, a blood protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There was good evidence of compatibility, which is really exciting,” said Peter Friend, a professor of transplantation at the University of Oxford. “Normally if you put a pig organ in it will be stone dead in a few minutes because you get hyper-acute rejection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team behind the advance, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08799-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;described in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, said it was not clear whether the liver would have been able to fully support the patient, given that he had an existing liver and because the liver was removed after 10 days at the request of his family. “We could not see whether the pig liver could support a patient with severe liver failure,” said Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Even if pig livers only partly replace liver function, they could still be valuable as a “bridging” transplant. Friend said that “elegant surgical plumbing” used by the team meant this could be a relatively straightforward procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“They basically slot the liver into … the main artery that runs from the leg towards the heart,” he said. “That makes it safer and much less prone to complications and something that can be removed as and when it’s not needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Muhammad Mohiuddin, director of the cardiac xenotransplantation programme at the University of Maryland, said: “This is a major leap forward for the field. With a liver, you don’t have to keep it for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“You can use it as a bridge until a human liver is available for transplant or it can be used as a partial support until the liver regenerates. I firmly believe that this can work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNRGhHUUExNUtWdmxPcnhQdmhVQjlTc0dPRVZOWUg5NkF0dXFVdU5zZUFNdUs1aHk4TUZQNjZET0h0M1V0eXE5WkdCc19vV1NST3FGZXU4VGRPcEx2UGtrNUhIUlZHR19xZlNmNU56SlZvV1ZUOUdCS0doV1F4dHhhd2QxMGJUQk5KYzhiX0tRZHpPVG9NcEU1RUh3a3VaR1JHcnJNdmJOWjVTazYzcEN4cTIxQ2tsQTNNT0ww</guid></item><item><title>Drug For Rare Disease Turns Human Blood Into Mosquito Poison - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNM2dWd1pFTUkybFdHZm1lVlZpQzlyZUdNQnBmT2FoSFl5VW1RX2FKeW5kV19yOVEtU3BmOXBuTGI1QTlYTnVQTFNIX1RZZzI2V3FJYlB6REUteDJyVXRaVGxRX3NjV09lNFJxNDhJUHVxOVoxdGoteFlub2ZMSVFXT3dSWmp5RnNwSmtZZ2V2T2ZWSVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have a radical new plan for controlling mosquito numbers and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria"&gt;fighting malaria&lt;/a&gt;: lacing human blood with a drug that's poisonous for the insects, so sucking on this blood marks their last meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug in question is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitisinone"&gt;nitisinone&lt;/a&gt;, and a proof-of-concept study led by a team from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK found that it could be deadly to mosquitoes at a low dose in human blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mosquitoes fed on the blood of three people who were already taking nitisinone to treat a genetic disorder, the insects died within 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitisinone already has regulatory approval for treating certain rare, inherited diseases. It works by blocking the production of a specific protein, which leads to reduced toxic disease byproducts in the human body. But when mosquitoes drink blood with nitisinone, they quickly die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156200" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/GlowingMosquito.jpg" alt="Glowing mosquito" class="wp-image-156200 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/GlowingMosquito.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/GlowingMosquito-618x415.jpg 618w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/GlowingMosquito-600x403.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156200" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Researchers looked at how nitisinone in human blood affected mosquitoes. (&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077736"&gt;Lee R. Haines&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One way to stop the spread of diseases transmitted by insects is to make the blood of animals and humans toxic to these blood-feeding insects," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077736"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; microbiologist Lee R. Haines from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that using nitisinone could be a promising new complementary tool for controlling insect-borne diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="156197" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment is still very much a proof-of-concept idea, and enthusiasm should be tempered by initial results from other antiparasitic drugs that can kill insects vital to ecosystems, and which may not actually reduce malaria rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous research, nitisinone does not seem to kill other vital insects that have pollinating roles in ecosystems, but its wider ecological impacts are not well studied, and there's a chance of insecticide resistance becoming a problem in the future if the mosquito-killing meds are incorporated into "mass drug administration programs", as the authors of the study &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr4827"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the effects of nitisinone-filled blood on mosquitoes, as well as using math models to figure out the impact of different doses on simulated human populations. They found the drug was effective at killing mosquitoes of all ages – including the older insects that are more likely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria-carrying-mosquitos-are-expanding-their-territory-almost-3-miles-a-year"&gt;to be carrying malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiparasitic drugs like this aren't a new idea, and the team compared nitisinone against &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin"&gt;ivermectin&lt;/a&gt;, which is already used as a potential tool to kill off mosquitoes as they feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-ivermectin" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73119" data-postid="156197" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ivermectin&lt;/a&gt; given to humans or cows can kill mosquitoes at lower concentrations than nitisinone, the new drug acts more quickly, often within a day. It also sticks around in human blood for a longer time, making it more likely that mosquitoes will come into contact with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We thought that if we wanted to go down this route, nitisinone had to perform better than ivermectin," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077736"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; parasitologist Álvaro Acosta Serrano from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. "Indeed, nitisinone performance was fantastic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has a much longer half-life in human blood than ivermectin, which means its mosquitocidal activity remains circulating in the human body for much longer. This is critical when applied in the field for safety and economical reasons."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike ivermectin, nitisinone does not target the nervous system, so it is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000796"&gt;less neurotoxic&lt;/a&gt;. What's more, studies indicate that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-024-01332-8"&gt;ivermectin kills other insects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaria is still responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2024"&gt;more than half a million deaths each year&lt;/a&gt;, and efforts to tackle it have stalled in the face of growing populations and the disease &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101746"&gt;developing a greater resistance&lt;/a&gt; to treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new approach offers some fresh hope for fighting malaria, and with further research, it could support &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/promising-new-malaria-vaccine-can-be-injected-by-mosquito-bite"&gt;other steps&lt;/a&gt; to stop the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria-carrying-mosquitos-are-expanding-their-territory-almost-3-miles-a-year"&gt;spread of the disease&lt;/a&gt; – without the risk of harm to humans or other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nitisinone is a versatile compound that can also be used as an insecticide," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077736"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Acosta Serrano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr4827"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Now a metal, sharp-tipped fence has been erected by the bridge with a warning that trespassers will be prosecuted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of New Braunfels &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1084595740380539&amp;amp;set=a.240950878078367&amp;amp;type=3&amp;amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;amp;rdid=p9BNsuXvTAf3jVof&amp;amp;share_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshare%2F18xkASjRYv%2F%3Fmibextid%3DwwXIfr" data-link="native" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""&gt;shared an image of the fence on Facebook &lt;/a&gt;with a reminder that access to the river from the Faust Street Bridge is "restricted and not open to the public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This area is not a public park and much of it is not City property," the City writes. "Due to ongoing trespassing and public safety issues, this area is no longer accessible but the Faust Street Bridge itself is still open to pedestrians. You can enjoy the beautiful rivers at River Acres Park, Cypress Bend Park, Hinman Island Park, the City Tube Chute, Prince Solms Park, and the Landa Park Aquatic Center."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City has been calling for an increase in security since at least July 2024, when video and images were shared of people accessing the river under the bridge and leaping from a tower-like structure, sometimes resulting in injuries. Trespassers have also reportedly caused littering, vandalism, lewd behavior and "lack of compliance with a disposable container ordinance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans for a $23,000 barrier were further pushed in November 2024 with a structure similar to the Wurstfest perimeter fence. The now completed fence allows law enforcement and emergency medical services access to the area and still allows tubers to access the river further upstream and downstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do believe that if a fence is in place, that we will have some vandalism, but at that point, it would be a clear 'no trespassing,'" New Braunfels Deputy City Manager Jordan Matney said in July 2024. "So our police officers could go down there and issue for trespassing for vandalism — anything that may come from that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>mySA</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 17:29:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOMDVFZ0RqcHR6TUNubTJ3OVl3M2FjNUFqTlZMdDBhUTdleWQ2blN5WDBmUVMyazVxbEpvZmR3dktnWTFZQkZPM2RTaEd2eW5CWXh6NHFOcFp0cG9SeHVwcVlxeWtMc3dtZmo3QjBzcmk3YzR1OVB1ZnljekxNYnI4bHJ0MkhMUzY1VG9zdHZGZEw5T2hQeDdKbUtWRjBsalAxQjBueA</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Alarmed As US Picks David Geier To Lead Controversial New Vaccine And Autism Study - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxPN2h3MU9mWkJQMlpMdU04NURkMnlfbXlxOVYxVG1IUUxHUEdRQjEwem5YU0RMZWRVR0p5aG1xSnh3Z1lia0xocnQwWkxFUDRmMXdxOHZtUEUzNVdfOGlBQXp0bjNESlpFblRNdkxLZFlYbVJfS29rTjlWVlo5THJUOVlmTGhJQ0k4d0oydUpaaDlBVHdFamxRRkxwZUs0TWFLQzdtQzNoekJvMUtVdncwVTVOa3NMZ1dIbURvUlVJZnVJWDN2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists are sounding the alarm after the Department of Health and Human Services has reportedly picked well-known and highly controversial vaccine skeptic David Geier to lead the new study. Among other problems, Geier was once disciplined by Maryland regulators for &lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierOrder07.302.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;practicing medicine without a license&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;“This is a worst-case scenario for public health,” Jessica Steier, head of the nonprofit Science Literacy Lab, told the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/?mc_cid=cb50cb3410&amp;amp;mc_eid=f0ea8849aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, saying that Geier, along with his father Mark Geier, had “demonstrated patterns of an anti-vaccine agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a slap in the face to the decades of actual credible research we have,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines are an astonishing achievement of modern science, saving an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/vaccination-likely-saved-a-whopping-154-million-lives-over-the-last-50-years-74126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;154 million lives&lt;/a&gt; (including 101 million infants) over the last 50 years, according to a major study led by the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; last year. Of these, the measles vaccine (often grouped with mumps and rubella in the MMR jab) is the biggest contributor, accounting for around 60 percent of the lives saved by vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately, over the last few decades, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/quarter-of-americans-still-believe-false-mmr-jab-autism-link-despite-total-lack-of-evidence-74507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;skepticism&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines has risen, largely stemming from a now-retracted study that claimed there was a connection between autism and the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Andrew Wakefield published a paper based on just 12 children that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. The results have not been replicated, and it later transpired that he had falsified data, for which his medical license was revoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Lancet completely retracted the Wakefield et al. paper in February 2010, admitting that several elements in the paper were incorrect, contrary to the findings of the earlier investigation. Wakefield et al. were held guilty of ethical violations (they had conducted invasive investigations on the children without obtaining the necessary ethical clearances) and scientific misrepresentation (they reported that their sampling was consecutive when, in fact, it was selective)," a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3136032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;report into the case&lt;/a&gt; explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The final episode in the saga is the revelation that Wakefield et al. were guilty of deliberate fraud (they picked and chose data that suited their case; they falsified facts). The British Medical Journal has published a series of articles on the exposure of the fraud, which appears to have taken place for financial gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8BIcAZxFfrc?&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the damage was done, as the press around the world continued to push the idea. Since then, there have been many &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/data-on-23-million-children-shows-no-link-between-autism-and-mmr-vaccine-55771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;large studies&lt;/a&gt; investigating potential links between vaccines and autism, consistently finding &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/large-study-provides-even-more-evidence-that-vaccines-have-nothing-to-do-with-autism-49242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;no link whatsoever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the US is planning on conducting research through the NIH (though it had previously been assigned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The Trump administration, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., lead of the Department of Health and Human Services (HSS), and President Trump himself, have long expressed vaccine-skeptic views. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking in Congress earlier this month, Trump cited rising autism diagnoses – largely thought to be &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/autism-rates-have-risen-15-percent-in-two-years-heres-why-47392" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;due to better diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and broader criteria for diagnosis, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/are-autism-rates-still-rising-among-american-children-its-hard-to-tell-45308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;different survey techniques&lt;/a&gt; – as a reason for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more scientific research in the area of autism couldn't hurt, the stress there is on &lt;em&gt;scientific &lt;/em&gt;research. Geier, working with his father Mark Geier, has authored a number of papers (&lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/15/journal-replaces-anti-vaccine-paper-retracted-missing-conflicts-number-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;some retracted&lt;/a&gt;) claiming that vaccines cause autism. Respected journal Nature named the duo as two of the top science-deniers in 2010, a not-so-coveted title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"This father-son duo, based in Washington, DC, was among the first to publish claims that the thimerosal preservative used in certain vaccines causes autism," the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nm0310-248b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;. "Mark Geier holds a doctorate in genetics; his son, David, has a bachelor’s degree in biology. Together, they promote therapies for autism including chelation, the use of chemicals to remove heavy metals from the body, and Lupron, a drug used to treat [prostate] cancer and chemically castrate sex offenders. Mark Geier has testified in support of the thimerosal-autism link as an expert witness at vaccine trials across the US; numerous rigorous studies, however, have dismissed this link."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Geier's medical license has been &lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/bpqapp/Orders/D2425004.271.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;suspended or revoked&lt;/a&gt; in every state where he has the license to practice, over concerns over his autism treatments, research with "serious methodological flaws", and that he had "falsely claimed to be a board-certified geneticist and a board-certified epidemiologist". Meanwhile, David Geier was disciplined by Maryland regulators for practicing medicine without a license at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one of the many available examples of less than rigorous science conducted by the pair, the Geiers' institutional review board on one paper was found to be somewhat lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The seven-member IRB [institutional review board] consists of Mark and David Geier; Dr Geier's wife; two of Dr Geier's business associates; and two mothers of autistic children, one of whom has publicly acknowledged that her son is a patient/subject of Dr Geier, and the other of whom is plaintiff in three pending vaccine injury claims," Kathleen Seidel, writer and researcher of autism &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1839225/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; following the publication and subsequent retraction of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a paper the two were authors on claimed that conflicts of interest may be influencing research into the link between vaccines and autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The editors retracted the paper without the authors’ agreement, because the authors had a host of personal and professional interests in the field they didn’t declare, such as being associated with organizations involved in autism and vaccine safety," &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/15/journal-replaces-anti-vaccine-paper-retracted-missing-conflicts-number-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Retraction Watch&lt;/a&gt; explains. "What’s more, the article also contained 'a number of errors, and mistakes of various types that raise concerns about the validity of the conclusion'.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen what form this new research will take, and whether it will cost more money on top of the &lt;a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/at-a-glance.pdf?ver=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;$419 million&lt;/a&gt; already spent on autism research by the US annually. But the real concern is that the research will not be conducted properly, and given Geier's track record, scientists and researchers are not confident that we could see otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"The methodology used in the studies was completely invalid, and the studies fatally flawed," Professor Jeffrey S. Morris, Director of the Division of Biostatistics at the &lt;a href="https://dbei.med.upenn.edu/staff/jeffrey-s-morris-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Perelman School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;a href="https://x.com/jsm2334/status/1904898109412454650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;on X&lt;/a&gt;, after outlining the flaws in one of Geier's papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
        &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jsm2334/status/1904898109412454650"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

"Ideally they should include experienced biostatisticians and epidemiologists to help use a valid study design and analysis, and ensure that their interpretation of the study is supported by the empirical evidence in the data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While proper research would be welcomed by scientists – on top of all the other research that has already disproved the link between vaccines and autism – many fear that the study is being set up to find a link where there isn't one. Alison Singer, president of the nonprofit organization Autism Science Foundation, told the Washington Post that the Trump administration's aim “is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/us-sees-first-measles-death-since-2015-as-texas-outbreak-grows-78235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, that seems like a very dangerous plan indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Fewer than 10 people die of the virus in the US each year.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUCAS COUNTY, Ohio — A Michigan resident died &lt;a href="/article/news/local/rabid-fox-animal-control-safety-rabies/83-974b18a4-8f71-48ea-9b0f-660711cb5af2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;from rabies&lt;/a&gt; after receiving a transplanted organ in Lucas County earlier this year, according to the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Carl Schmidt, a deputy coroner with the Lucas County Coroner's Office, said the recipient, who had undergone a kidney transplant in December, contracted the viral disease through the donated organ.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The diagnosis was confirmed by sending tissue to the CDC," Schmidt said. "The cause of death is rabies and complications."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services worked with the Ohio Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the case, marking the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6014a1.htm#:~:text=In%25202009%252C%2520a%2520Michigan%2520resident,later%252C%2520after%2520symptoms%2520had%2520developed." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6014a1.htm#:~:text=in%25202009%252c%2520a%2520michigan%2520resident,later%252c%2520after%2520symptoms%2520had%2520developed."&gt;first human case of rabies in Michigan since 2009&lt;/a&gt;. The testing was conducted in the CDC’s Rabies Lab.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been no reported human cases of rabies in Ohio since 1970, according to the &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/zoonotic-disease-program/diseases/rabies" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://odh.ohio.gov/know-our-programs/zoonotic-disease-program/diseases/rabies"&gt;Ohio Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC, along with state health departments, confirmed that no additional individuals are at risk of rabies exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A multi-state public health investigation was conducted to determine the risk of exposure to the recipient and found no risk to the general public," Heather Burnette, spokesperson for the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department, said. "Because the recipient was a Michigan resident, this case will not be classified as an Ohio human rabies case."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kara Steele, a representative from &lt;a href="https://www.lifeconnection.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.lifeconnection.org/"&gt;Life Connection of Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, could not comment on the specific case but explained to WTOL 11 that a donor risk assessment interview is conducted before any organ donation.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[It gathers] a potential donor’s comprehensive medical and social history on top of a physical assessment and lab work in order to ensure the safety of organs for transplantation," Steele said. "If an organ procurement organization received word from a transplant center concerning any recipient issues, the organ procurement organization would reach out to additional centers that transplanted other organs from a donor hero to see how their recipients are doing and then report back."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identities of both the recipient and the donor have not been released.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility where the transplant took place has also not been disclosed. However, according to the University of Toledo Medical Center’s &lt;a href="https://news.utoledo.edu/index.php/03_18_2025/utoledo-health-expands-transplant-program-to-include-pancreas" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://news.utoledo.edu/index.php/03_18_2025/utoledo-health-expands-transplant-program-to-include-pancreas"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, it is the only organ transplant center in northwest Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTOL 11 has reached out to UTMC for comment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC urges individuals to&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/index.html"&gt; contact a healthcare provider immediately if they suspect exposure to rabies.&lt;/a&gt; Any mammal can contract rabies, although high-risk animals include bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer than 10 people in the United States die from rabies each year, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p class="" data-start="59" data-end="462"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High cholesterol often sneaks up on people. You may feel perfectly fine, yet inside your arteries, LDL cholesterol—commonly referred to as the “bad” kind—is slowly building up. Left unchecked, it can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. The good news? There’s a simple, natural habit that can help lower your cholesterol in just a few weeks—and it starts with what’s on your plate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="59" data-end="462"&gt;&lt;span id="more-4824"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="464" data-end="503"&gt;The Cholesterol Puzzle: Good vs. Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="505" data-end="792"&gt;Cholesterol isn’t all bad. In fact, your body needs it. Produced by the liver, this &lt;strong data-start="589" data-end="611"&gt;fat-like substance&lt;/strong&gt; plays a crucial role in hormone production and cell function. The key is maintaining the right balance between &lt;strong data-start="723" data-end="755"&gt;HDL (the “good” cholesterol)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="760" data-end="791"&gt;LDL (the “bad” cholesterol)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="794" data-end="1124"&gt;As registered dietitian &lt;strong data-start="818" data-end="833"&gt;Alice Hantz&lt;/strong&gt; explains, HDL helps &lt;strong data-start="854" data-end="883"&gt;remove excess cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; from the bloodstream, while LDL tends to &lt;strong data-start="925" data-end="941"&gt;stick around&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially leading to &lt;strong data-start="966" data-end="985"&gt;arterial plaque&lt;/strong&gt; and reduced blood flow. Diet, stress, and a sedentary lifestyle can all worsen this imbalance—but that’s where &lt;strong data-start="1097" data-end="1114"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/strong&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1126" data-end="1155"&gt;The Power of Soluble Fiber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1157" data-end="1478"&gt;Think of &lt;strong data-start="1166" data-end="1183"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/strong&gt; as nature’s sponge. When consumed, it moves through the digestive system and &lt;strong data-start="1261" data-end="1286"&gt;traps LDL cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; before it can enter your bloodstream. “It also binds to bile acids,” Hantz notes, “which forces the liver to use up more cholesterol to make new ones—further reducing circulating LDL levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1480" data-end="1615"&gt;Experts recommend &lt;strong data-start="1498" data-end="1541"&gt;25 to 30 grams of soluble fiber per day&lt;/strong&gt; to see noticeable improvements in cholesterol within &lt;strong data-start="1595" data-end="1614"&gt;about one month&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1617" data-end="1636"&gt;Where to Find It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1638" data-end="1719"&gt;Fortunately, soluble fiber is easy to incorporate into your &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/how-walking-after-meals-can-help-you-lose-weight-but-only-if-you-time-it-right/"&gt;meals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s found in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="1721" data-end="1953"&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="1721" data-end="1762"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1723" data-end="1762"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1723" data-end="1739"&gt;Whole grains&lt;/strong&gt; like oats and barley&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="1763" data-end="1813"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1765" data-end="1813"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1765" data-end="1775"&gt;Fruits&lt;/strong&gt; such as apples, citrus, and berries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="1814" data-end="1875"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1816" data-end="1875"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1816" data-end="1827"&gt;Legumes&lt;/strong&gt; including lentils, chickpeas, and black beans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="1876" data-end="1953"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1878" data-end="1953"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1878" data-end="1887"&gt;Seeds&lt;/strong&gt; like flax and chia, which also contain &lt;strong data-start="1927" data-end="1953"&gt;heart-healthy omega-3s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1955" data-end="2212"&gt;One under-the-radar source is &lt;strong data-start="1985" data-end="2002"&gt;psyllium husk&lt;/strong&gt;, a fiber extracted from the seeds of the plantain plant. You can stir it into water, smoothies, or yogurt. It’s especially effective and often used in natural supplements to support digestive and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2214" data-end="2250"&gt;How to Add More Fiber to Your Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2252" data-end="2592"&gt;Small changes can make a big difference. Start your day with &lt;strong data-start="2313" data-end="2360"&gt;oatmeal topped with berries or apple slices&lt;/strong&gt;, or blend a spoonful of &lt;strong data-start="2385" data-end="2399"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/strong&gt; into your morning smoothie. At lunch, toss some &lt;strong data-start="2448" data-end="2485"&gt;lentils or chickpeas into a salad&lt;/strong&gt;, and at dinner, pair your meal with &lt;strong data-start="2522" data-end="2547"&gt;fiber-rich vegetables&lt;/strong&gt; like carrots, broccoli, or Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2594" data-end="2810"&gt;For snacks, reach for &lt;strong data-start="2616" data-end="2646"&gt;a fresh orange or an apple&lt;/strong&gt; instead of processed options. These little tweaks can quietly work in the background to &lt;strong data-start="2735" data-end="2764"&gt;improve your heart health&lt;/strong&gt;—without drastically overhauling your routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2812" data-end="2868"&gt;Boosting the Benefits with Omega-3s and Plant Sterols&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2870" data-end="3070"&gt;In addition to fiber, &lt;strong data-start="2892" data-end="2915"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/strong&gt; provide another layer of cardiovascular protection. These healthy fats help &lt;strong data-start="2992" data-end="3015"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/strong&gt; and improve cholesterol profiles. You’ll find them in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="3072" data-end="3193"&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3072" data-end="3126"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3074" data-end="3126"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3074" data-end="3088"&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/strong&gt; like salmon, mackerel, and sardines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3127" data-end="3154"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3129" data-end="3154"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3129" data-end="3152"&gt;Chia and flax seeds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3155" data-end="3193"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3157" data-end="3193"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3157" data-end="3193"&gt;Walnuts and canola or walnut oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3195" data-end="3490"&gt;Also worth considering are &lt;strong data-start="3222" data-end="3251"&gt;plant sterols and stanols&lt;/strong&gt;—natural compounds found in fortified margarines, yogurts, and juices. When consumed regularly (1.5 to 2.4 grams per day), they can &lt;strong data-start="3383" data-end="3421"&gt;lower LDL cholesterol by up to 10%&lt;/strong&gt; in just a few weeks by partially blocking its absorption in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="3492" data-end="3516"&gt;Move More, Worry Less&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3518" data-end="3848"&gt;Of course, &lt;strong data-start="3529" data-end="3565"&gt;diet alone isn’t the whole story&lt;/strong&gt;. Regular physical activity, even brisk walking or light cycling a few times a week, helps raise HDL levels and keeps your metabolism in check. And don’t forget to &lt;strong data-start="3729" data-end="3753"&gt;limit saturated fats&lt;/strong&gt; from processed foods, fatty meats, and full-fat dairy—they can sabotage all your good efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="3850" data-end="3889"&gt;A Simple Shift with Powerful Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3891" data-end="4146"&gt;You don’t need a complicated routine or a prescription to start lowering your cholesterol. By focusing on &lt;strong data-start="3997" data-end="4017"&gt;fiber-rich &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/feed-your-brain-a-neurosurgeons-list-of-8-foods-to-fight-cognitive-decline/"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, healthy fats, and a bit of movement, you can &lt;strong data-start="4064" data-end="4115"&gt;make measurable improvements in just four weeks&lt;/strong&gt;—naturally, and without stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="4148" data-end="4236"&gt;Sometimes, the best solutions really are the simplest. Your heart will thank you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

While &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10255782/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that exercising and a nutritious diet help, adding the best foods for brain health to your plate is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S. R.D., LA-based registered dietitian and author of book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/MIND-Diet-Scientific-Enhancing-Alzheimers/dp/1646047249/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64273891%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The MIND Diet: 2nd Edition;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The MIND Diet: 2nd Edition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says a variety of nutrients work towards better brain health. Omega-3s, found in fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, “are essential fatty acids that the body can’t produce on its own,” she explains. “These healthy anti-inflammatory fats are literally part of the structure of brain cells, keeping their cell membranes flexible and healthy,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B vitamins also support brain health. “In particular, B6, B9 (folate), and B12, work together to reduce levels of neurotoxins associated with cognitive decline,” explains Moon. Choline, lutein, polyphenols, and potassium are a few more that help the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: Lauren Pincus, M.S., R.D.N., author of &lt;em&gt;The Protein-Packed Breakfast Club; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/maggiemoon.com/about/__;!!Ivohdkk!g8aQjNHsBRl1AdkeQvId0hRffjWjiUU-AKWqUOcg9Bnai8oFj-2IT8Dh57WAZ8hqPwZpYj9APZBxjmCH8E4f$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maggie Moon, M.S., R.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., R.D&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;., LA-based registered dietitian and author of book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/MIND-Diet-Scientific-Enhancing-Alzheimers/dp/1646047249/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64273891%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The MIND Diet: 2nd Edition;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The MIND Diet: 2nd Edition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;;; Alma Simmons, R.D.N., L.D., C.D.C.E.S., registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist; Julie Duffy Dillon, M.S., R.D.N., N.C.C., L.D.N., CEDS-S, is an eating disorder specialist, and food behavior expert, and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Find-Voice-Julie-Duffy-Dillon/dp/139981365X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64273891%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Find Your Food Voice;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Find Your Food Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium plays a big part in brain health and energy metabolism, explains Julie Duffy Dillon, M.S., R.D.N., N.C.C., L.D.N., CEDS-S, an eating disorder specialist, and food behavior expert, and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Find-Voice-Julie-Duffy-Dillon/dp/139981365X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64273891%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Find Your Food Voice;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Find Your Food Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “When a person is eating enough and adds magnesium-rich foods, it can help lower insulin levels, improve cognitive function, and promote more restful sleep,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some foods boost other organs, which in turn help the brain, explains Alma Simmons, R.D.N., L.D., C.D.C.E.S., registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist. “Research has shown that eating nuts can improve heart health markers, and having a healthy heart is linked to having a healthy brain and a lower risk of neurological disorders,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, find dietitian-recommended foods for brain health to add to your weekly menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best foods for brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Salmon&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pincus notes that research shows that consuming more “EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids improves cognition and working memory, and may aid in slowing cognitive decline. Omega-3s play a role in mood regulation, helping the brain communicate using the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, and reducing inflammation in the brain, which has been linked to depression,” Pincus says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Avocado&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados not only offer healthy fats which &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(22)01132-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show boost overall health, but they also contain Omega-3s. “Omega-3 is needed for the brain cell membranes,” Duffy Dillon explains. “It is also required to create myelin sheaths, the coating surrounding nerves which help transmit messages throughout the body.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moon says polyphenols have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that work to reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in the brain so that it can function at its best. Dark chocolate is high in cacao polyphenols, making it a tasty brain food (in moderation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyphenols also “improve blood flow to the brain, which means a better supply of nutrients and oxygen to fuel how we think, learn, and remember,” Moon says. Science backs this up. One small &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024004614" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that adults who ate chocolate high in cacao polyphenols performed better on a cognitive test than those who ate chocolate low in cacao polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pistachios&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pistachios have a high antioxidant capacity that rivals that of popular antioxidant-containing foods, and they are a plant-based source of complete protein,” explains Lauren Pincus, M.S., R.D.N., author of &lt;em&gt;The Protein-Packed Breakfast Club&lt;/em&gt;. “Foods that are high in antioxidants can be a powerful weapon against disease and premature aging of your body and your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Wild blueberries&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating “wild blueberries regularly may be an effective way to enhance some aspects of brain function and maintain others,” Pincus explains. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768899/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown wild blueberries can improve executive function, enhance memory, may slow down age-related cognitive decline, and improve metabolic health which benefits brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Spinach&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like spinach and kale offer major brain-healthy nutrients like “vitamin K, lutein, folate, and beta carotene,” Pincus says. In fact, she points to a &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000004815" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that showed that around one serving a day of green leafy vegetables may help slow cognitive decline associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Beans&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various types of beans “contain folate, iron, magnesium, and antioxidants, which are all important to maintaining good brain health,” Pincus says. “Folate plays a role in neurodevelopment and cognitive function while iron helps with oxygen transport to the brain. Magnesium supports numerous biochemical reactions in the brain and helps with neurotransmitter regulation. Antioxidants like polyphenols help protect brain cells from oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pumpkin seeds&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pumpkin seeds contain antioxidants that may protect the body and brain from free-radical damage. They’re also an excellent source of other nutrients important for brain health, including magnesium, zinc, iron, and copper,” says Simmons. Duffy Dillon also recommends seeds as a source of magnesium, which she says helps boost brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Eggs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons explains that eggs are a good source of nutrients tied to brain health, including vitamins B6 and B12, folate, and choline. Moon says egg yolks are packed with choline. “The brain needs choline to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that supports early brain development and lifelong memory maintenance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Green tea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28899506/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that green tea may help with cognition. Simmons says, “Green tea contains caffeine, which may boost brain function and improve alertness, performance, memory, and focus,” she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Broccoli&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simmons points to broccoli as another brain-boosting food. “Broccoli also contains compounds such as sulforaphane that provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and may help protect the brain against damage. Sulforaphane levels are highly concentrated in broccoli sprouts,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Trout&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideal for those observing a pescatarian eating plan, or people simply looking to change up their menu, trout is a great brain food option. The fish is chock full of Omega-3s, which Duffy Dillon recommends adding to your menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Corn tortillas&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corn tortillas contain lutein, which Moon says, “is a carotenoid with antioxidant benefits that also happens to make foods yellow or green, making them easy to spot in the produce department. “Lutein collects in the brain and eye area to protect them against oxidative stress,” she says. “We need this because the brain uses 20% of our oxygen, making it susceptible to oxidative stress.” Duffy Dillon also recommends corn tortillas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;High in Omega-3s, chia seeds are another great choice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589531/#Abs1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that chia seeds may aid in cognition. Enjoy them as a pudding by pairing them with healthy fats (like almond butter) and berries for a truly brain-boosting breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying hydrated is key for brain health. “Drink plenty of water, but you can eat your hydration by enjoying any fruit or vegetable that is crisp like cucumbers and bell peppers, or juicy like tomatoes or watermelon,” explains Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recipes for brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add these delicious eats to your weekly rotation to aid in cognition and generally give your mind a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods to avoid for brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, our experts recommend consuming the below in moderation, or steering clear if you’re inclined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day, fueling your body is what’s most important. After all, the body needs calories to function. “Eating enough food calorically including enough carbohydrates, proteins, and fats will help the brain preserve cognitive functions,” explains Duffy Dillon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025

nine months&lt;/a&gt; is so clean it's making crews sick, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Astronauts typically live on the orbiting laboratory for up to six months, but &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/nasa/index.html" id="mol-630ca480-0a5b-11f0-b4f2-39554133f6d0"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;'s Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore were stuck there for more than nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14519253/space-nasa-rescued-astronaut-lifelong-hidden-health-problems.html"&gt;During such long-term missions, astronauts often experience immune system dysfunction, skin rashes and inflammatory conditions&lt;/a&gt;, but scientists have struggled to determine the exact causes of these spaceflight side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, new research suggests these issues could be related to the 'excessively sterile nature of the spacecraft.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earth is home to roughly one trillion species of microbes, some of which make people sick while others play critical roles in keeping the human body healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-11185881/First-human-microbiome-LAB-combining-119-species-bacteria-body.html"&gt;The good bacteria in our bodies bolster the immune system, ward off infections, help the gut digest food, control inflammatory responses and more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the ISS has a much lower diversity of microbes than our home planet, and most of the species that live there were &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/article-6569355/Bacteria-International-Space-Station-adapting-survive-harm.html"&gt;carried there by astronauts&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lack of good bacteria on the space station may be suppressing astronauts' immune systems, making them more vulnerable to rashes, cold sores, fungal infections, shingles and other ailments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The International Space Station (ISS) where NASA astronauts Sunita Williams (L) and Barry Wilmore (R) were stranded for nine months is so clean it's making crews sick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team collaborated with astronauts who swabbed 803 different surfaces on the ISS to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6424043/Infectious-organisms-alive-board-international-space-station-NASA-reveals.html"&gt;create the most extensive survey of the space station's microbiome yet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the samples were brought back to Earth, scientists analyzed them to determine which bacteria species and chemicals were present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To understand how the bacteria and chemicals might be interacting, they then created three-dimensional maps showing where each was found on the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, human skin was the main source of microbes throughout the space station, and chemicals from cleaning products and disinfectants were found on nearly every surface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the microbial communities and chemicals varied in each space station module, and the differences seemed to be determined by the module's use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unsurprisingly, dining and food preparation areas contained more food-associated microbes, where as the space toiled contained more urine- and fecal-associated microbes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In general, the researchers found that the space station's microbiome was far less diverse than that of most terrestrial environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ISS samples were most similar to samples taken from industrialized, isolated Earth environments, such as hospitals, closed habitats and homes in urbanized areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microbial and chemical samples taken from the ISS were most similar to ones taken from industrialized, isolated Earth environments, such as hospitals and homes in urbanized areas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The good bacteria in our bodies bolster the immune system, ward off infections, help the gut digest food, control inflammatory responses and more &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found evidence to suggest that the high levels of disinfectant and cleaning chemicals on the space station are suppressing the diversity of its microbiome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We noticed that the abundance of disinfectant on the surface of the International Space Station is highly correlated with the microbiome diversity at different locations on the space station,' said co-first author and UC San Diego postdoctoral researcher Nina Zhao. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may be driving certain health issues for astronauts living on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sterile environments are not in fact the safest environments,' study co-author and UC San Diego professor Rob Knight told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/missions/how-microbes-from-earth-can-help-astronauts-adapt-to-long-term-space-missions"&gt;Space.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Exposure to beneficial microbes in the environment is important for maintaining health — this is not surprising because, as humans, we have coevolved with those environmental microbes for millions of years.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that increasing the microbial diversity aboard the space station could reduce some of the health risks of spaceflight.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Future built environments, including space stations, could benefit from intentionally fostering diverse microbial communities that better mimic the natural microbial exposures experienced on Earth, rather than relying on highly sanitized spaces,' said co-first author and former UC San Diego biotechnology researcher Rodolfo Salido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this wouldn't mean compromising on hygiene, the researchers say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a big difference between exposure to healthy soil from gardening versus stewing in our own filth, which is kind of what happens if we're in a strictly enclosed environment with no ongoing input of those healthy sources of microbes from the outside,' Knight said in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250227124856.htm"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we really want life to thrive outside Earth, we can't just take a small branch of the tree of life and launch it into space and hope that it will work out,' Salido said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to start thinking about what other beneficial companions we should be sending with these astronauts to help them develop ecosystems that will be sustainable and beneficial for all.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But before we can do that, further research is needed to assess whether microbes that are beneficial to humans on Earth could become harmful in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This risk could arise from the lack of microbial diversity on the ISS, which may allow certain species to propagate rapidly and exceed safe levels, or from increased genetic mutation of the bacteria due to space radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These factors can be tested on Earth before proceeding to costly space experiments,' Knight told Space.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:17:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rapidly rising autism rates could be due to over diagnosis and poor diagnostic criteria, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using an &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/ai/index.html" id="mol-da33b100-0a44-11f0-a0e0-c7f492444eb1"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; algorithm, researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-da3a40b0-0a44-11f0-a0e0-c7f492444eb1" class=""&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; combed through more than 4,000 clinical reports from children being evaluated for autism to measure which criteria was most often used to diagnose autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The criteria were sourced from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the gold standard in diagnosing mental conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diagnostic criteria for autism in the DSM-5 includes behavior like avoiding eye contact, highly limited interests, repetitive movements, and trouble forming friendships or having back and forth conversations, among other signs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found social-related behaviors like nonverbal communication and forming relationships weren't specific to an Autism diagnosis - they weren't found much more in people diagnosed with autism than people not diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, repetitive movements - also called 'stimming' - and hyperfixations were strongly linked to an autism diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said the findings suggest doctors are over diagnosing autism based on the social-related factors and aren't spending enough time looking at behaviors like stimming, which are more closely aligned with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They argued streamlining autism evaluations to focus more on non-social behaviors with AI programs used to evaluate language would make&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14481591/autism-test-disorder-diagnosis.html"&gt; diagnosing autism more 'effective and efficient,'&lt;/a&gt; as social behaviors are harder to evaluate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It would also help patients get access to appropriate therapies and treatments faster. While there is no cure for autism, there are some therapies like applied behavioral anaylsis (ABA) and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14409159/breakthrough-autistic-boy-symptoms-reversed-cheap-drug.html"&gt;medications thought to improve behaviors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study suggests autism may be over diagnosed due to diagnostic criteria that needs to be re-evaluated (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Danilo Bzdok, a neuroscientist at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital and Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute in Canada, said: 'In the future, large language model technologies may prove instrumental in reconsidering what we call autism today.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.025"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed 4,200 observational clinic reports from 1,080 children in Quebec being evaluated for autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers tailored a large language modelling program - a type of AI that processes and understands language - to look through these reports and predict if an autism diagnosis would be given. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 1,080 participants, 429 were diagnosed with autism by doctors. Included children were seven years old on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers fed the DSM-5's seven criteria descriptions into the AI model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are: difficulties sharing interests with others or having conversations, difficulties in non-verbal communication like making eye contact, difficulties maintaining relationships with other people, repetitive movements and mimicking, rigid adherence to routines or extreme resistance to change, highly restricted interests, and increased sensitivity to sensory stimulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using the AI model, the researchers argued patients diagnosed with autism were most likely to exhibit non-social behaviors highlighted in the DSM-5's criteria like repetitive behaviors, echolalia, highly restricted interests, or sensory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts suggested that, given the findings, it may be more efficient to focus on non-social behaviors when evaluating a child for autism rather than social ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graphic shows the behaviors the AI program found was most often linked to an autism diagnosis &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also argued for diagnostic criteria to be re-evaluated to make diagnoses more accurate and it less likely for autism to be over diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team noted there were several limitations, including less data on older children who may exhibit different signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study comes as the US faces a surge in autism diagnoses.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-adf9d090-0a5a-11f0-a9b4-1b0d01aff380" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data, one in 36 children in the US have autism - just under 2million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early 2000s, this number was closer to seven in 1,000.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, most with the disorder are diagnosed by age five, though some can be tested as young as two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research published last year in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825472#:~:text=The%20ASD%20diagnosis%20rate%20was,6.3%20per%201000%20in%202022."&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; found between 2011 and 2022, autism diagnoses in children between ages five and eight rose 175 percent, from two per 1,000 people to six per 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the biggest increase was among young adults ages 26 to 34, with a 450 percent jump, which suggests they were delayed in getting a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with environmental exposures, experts have noted the rise of autism is partly due to doctors getting better at detecting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, autism advocacy groups have said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:15:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPU2U4RVRLdlZHMmhQakNWQjdWWkFVME9jT1hXNTF5aF9tQkdHdHVaTnlMZEhid285a1NScGVldlA1bEdzWEJVRTk3VXdZclJKOUtJLUdGQmFiR0tKWFM4V1dmc3NKejdZY1Nwd0ZBbjhEV0N4c2JWSWVyeFJlV1Z3WW9BTG9DZTc1UzByMF94VVFHTkdqR0lVczZwT0xwMXEx0gGmAUFVX3lxTE5fby1ENDdaZ2M3aFR0R0VDLVV1clE5RTNQcDVIQUZ6TXBOMWNXTTVfeGs1TV9xVmUwNDNKZ3Q2LTRkYzRkZGpVTV91V3JZaHFHOFZobDBaT3B4d3NHdmdBcTZqcEJRTmFEaF9lYVgxSmhRSzdHc3NnVkF1eEhTMmhBbmN6LUw2VVl3Vl9XQ21WM1dCcDZPdzBBSjRZOUF4ZFlXclRjVUE</guid></item><item><title>Experimental transplant of gene-edited pig liver into human offers hope for new frontier of research - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQRG9kQ3BwdjVNMklOT096dlVfaTJEV3ZHYTJib0hUTmtQWEpwRDlsd2dqdFMySXNLRVNmUS14LVgxSjE5OTVOUkF5dFh4Zmo3YzM3ZGlqaFY3cmJPdG1XUGJUTklnM0JFMmF4MDVtUklnR3dUd2lCektRbGVIT1kwdUk4b1ZqQzlw0gF_QVVfeXFMTlNNYU5hS3RiV2pwWWdETWFJMWhLak50TTZxVFRpbGR2SE9OM0M4UjZ3b2doS1lVWFJCaTB5Yko0NXZWalMtZC1HbGlQb09LeUtSV0tNTVNFZ25RYjZPWEo3WmVjZE9fWFVuTGVRalhVUDZXdTdIOHoteF9zMWVrUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Doctors in China have become the first to report details about a transplant of a genetically modified pig liver into a human.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000d336m2wgh101h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The liver was transplanted last year into a person who was brain-dead, and it “functioned very well in the human body” for 10 days, the researchers said. The blood flow to the organ was good, and there were no signs of immune rejection or accumulation of inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000e336ma30qywq5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a great achievement,” said Dr. Lin Wang, a co-author of the study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08799-1" target="_blank"&gt;published Wednesday in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0002336m5ecvmu8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more than 100,000 people on organ transplant waiting lists &lt;a href="https://unos.org/data/#:~:text=Improve.,of%20today%201:00pm%20EDT" target="_blank"&gt;in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;, the demand for human organs far outpaces the supply. Scientists have been exploring alternatives for decades, including using pig organs because of their similarity to human organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p3cgdl00013b6mi3lk7byj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/january/first-successful-external-liver-perfusion-using-a-porcine-liver" target="_blank"&gt;Penn Medicine&lt;/a&gt; did the first successful external liver perfusion using a gene-edited pig liver﻿. Blood in a brain-dead patient circulated through a pig’s liver that was outside the person’s body. In that case, the pig’s liver showed no signs of inflammation in the 72 hours it was tested and the patient’s body remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0003336mx12wlu39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have had some successes transplanting gene-edited pig kidneys and hearts into people, but liver transplants have proven to be more complicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0004336mqdxkfzjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The heart just functions as a heart to pump the blood. The major function of the kidney is to produce the urine. The liver has so many functions,” Wang, a surgeon in the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery at Xijing Hospital in Xi’an, China, said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0005336mqb4c00un@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The liver filters the blood, removing toxins and waste; processes nutrients; detoxifies harmful substances like alcohol and drugs; produces bile to help with digestion; produces proteins that help the blood clot; and plays an important role in regulating blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0006336mro3bdm7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working with the liver “is so difficult,” Wang said. “We all know the function of the liver is so complicated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0007336mybntc21b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Replacing a human organ with a pig’s is complicated, said Dr. Shimul Shah, an expert in xenotransplantation — the transplant of animal organs into humans — and division chief of abdominal transplantation in the Integrated Department of Surgery at Mass General Brigham.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p3kxvt00043b6mqskkncty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The liver is a larger organ with a dual blood supply, meaning it gets blood from two sources: the hepatic artery bringing oxygenated blood and the portal vein that brings nutrient-rich partially deoxygenated blood from the digestive organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0008336m5zktxg1y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve done a much better job in kidney and heart and, even in the near future, in lung,” said Shah, who was not involved with the new report. “Liver is going to take a little bit more time.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000q336mf006kn6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As of September, more than 9,000 people in the US were waiting for a liver transplant. It is the second biggest need on the transplant list, following only kidneys. &lt;a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000l336m1o5w4ebz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A successful pig liver transplant would be a major advance for people with acute liver failure, even as a temporary bridge while awaiting a human donor organ. By the time most of these patients make it to the hospital, Shah said, their livers are so damaged that a transplant is the only option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p46za3000b3b6mh9h2h01v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You can’t take out someone’s liver and not give them something that is going to function in the meantime,” Shah said. A pig organ may be a good fit in this situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy0009336m9ks07xfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The newly documented transplant was conducted in March 2024 in China.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000a336m0saci134@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To make the organ more compatible with the human body, scientists made six gene edits to a liver from a Bama miniature pig.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000b336ml2pqwt0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the surgeons placed the pig organ in the patient, they still kept the human liver in place. Wang said he wasn’t sure whether a pig liver could ever fully replace a human’s, since the volume of material that the pig liver produces may not fulfill what a human body requires.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p3s5zl00083b6mroo737dr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Separate from Wednesday’s study, the team in China said it has also conducted a pig-to-human liver transplant that involved removal of the human organ, but details about that procedure have not been released.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000f336mvj6jo1ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the newly published case, the researchers terminated the experiment after 10 days at the request of the family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjy000g336mwox97g1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wang said the new work builds on what the researchers have learned about xenotransplantation from surgeons in the US who have had some success with transplanting kidneys and hearts. It also builds on their own work with animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000h336m0rrnwccm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2013, Wang and his colleagues were the first in China to successfully transplant a pig liver into a monkey, which survived 14 days. The team said it has also done pig-to-monkey heart, kidney, cornea, skin and bone transplants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000i336mbl3kdlyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wang says the team also recently transplanted a pig kidney into a human, and that patient should be well enough to go home soon. Details of the case have not yet been published.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000j336mjiwravko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shah has been &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/press-release/mgh-performs-second-xenotransplant-of-genetically-edited-pig-kidney-into-living-recipient" target="_blank"&gt;a part of the team&lt;/a&gt; at Mass General Brigham that successfully transplanted a pig kidney into a human who is currently doing well enough to live at home. He believes that the science is not quite there yet for the liver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000k336m6fdla1j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think this will help us understand, how do we advance liver xenotransplantation? Because we need more work like this,” Shah said of the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p20jjz000n336mit52g2b9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Incremental steps help doctors get a step closer to fulfilling the ultimate goal of being able to offer a transplant to everyone who needs one, said Dr. Parsia Vagefi, chief of surgical transplantation at UT Southwestern Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8p2lfng0011336md87f3dkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors have experimented with liver dialysis and medicines to treat people with acute liver failure, said Vagefi, who wasn’t involved with the new research, but “nothing’s really moved the needle yet, aside from transplantation, to really help that population.”

&lt;p&gt;The human brain suddenly starts aging much faster around age 44, and that aging reaches a maximum speed at age 67, a new study finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published March 3 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2416433122" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2416433122" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PNAS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, seems to align with the results of a different study that Live Science recently reported on, which looked at aging using blood samples and found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/human-aging-accelerates-dramatically-at-age-44-and-60" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/human-aging-accelerates-dramatically-at-age-44-and-60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;periods of accelerated aging take place around ages 44 and 60&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new neuroscience study also found that brain aging was linked to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which cells need more insulin than usual to keep blood sugar in check. Furthermore, it uncovered early hints that ketone supplements may offer some protection against certain measures of brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/44364-what-is-ketosis.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/44364-what-is-ketosis.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ketones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are compounds in the body that act as an alternative fuel source, standing in for sugars. So if the brain is aging because it's not getting enough sugars, ketones could help fill the gap, the team theorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, much more research is needed to back this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/13-proteins-tied-to-brain-aging-seem-to-spike-at-ages-57-70-and-78" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/13-proteins-tied-to-brain-aging-seem-to-spike-at-ages-57-70-and-78"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 proteins tied to brain aging seem to spike at ages 57, 70 and 78&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="early-warning-signs-of-brain-aging-3"&gt;Early warning signs of brain aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used four existing datasets of brain scans that together included scans from 19,300 people ages 18 to 90. To study how different brain regions are linked in networks, the team looked at two types of brain scans: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures blood flow in the brain, and electroencephalograms (EEGs), which measure electrical firing between neurons in the outermost layer of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rAHnU32GwaDiVQc5NzfP6D" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rAHnU32GwaDiVQc5NzfP6D slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these scans, the scientists looked for signs that blood flow and electric firing between brain regions either disappeared or became inconsistent, suggesting there was a breakdown in communication between nodes in the network. They had considered this network disintegration a hallmark of aging in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913042117" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913042117" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wherein they assessed the impact of diet on the brain. Such disruptions are also seen in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and the degree of disruption typically reflects the person's overall degree of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through their analysis, the researchers found that the brain starts to age more quickly around age 44 and that the aging accelerates to a maximum rate around age 67. After that, brain aging starts slowing down, until the rate stabilizes around age 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we did not anticipate was that the effects might be occurring as early as the 40s," study senior author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/bme/people/l_parodi.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/bme/people/l_parodi.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lilianne Mujica-Parodi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at Stony Brook University, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="sugars-versus-ketones-3"&gt;Sugars versus ketones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network disruptions the researchers observed resembled changes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73138" target="_blank" data-url="https://elifesciences.org/articles/73138" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previously documented&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of people ages 50 to 80 with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Mujica-Parodi and her team wondered if the changes arose because neurons were not responding well to insulin, the hormone responsible for shuttling sugar from the blood into cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect wouldn't affect only people with diabetes. About "88% of North Americans have at least one detectable sign of insulin resistance," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.tec.mx/vivo-tec/display/PID_478997" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.tec.mx/vivo-tec/display/PID_478997" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Luis Adrian Soto-Mota&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a metabolism researcher at the Monterrey Institute of Technology in Mexico who was not involved with the study but previously worked with the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at all the brain scans, which included scans from people with and without insulin resistance, the team found that people in their 40s with high &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/44498-what-is-normal-blood-sugar.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/44498-what-is-normal-blood-sugar.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood sugar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; levels experienced faster brain aging than people of the same age with no signs of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, across all of the scans, certain parts of the brain aged more quickly than others, so the researchers wondered if those brain regions might be more insulin dependent. It's known that a protein named &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(19)88027-4/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(19)88027-4/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLUT4 relies on insulin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to move sugar into cells. So the team turned to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7066664283440782401&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-642-30574-0_62&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fbrain-aging-accelerates-dramatically-around-age-44-could-ketone-supplements-help" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-30574-0_62" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-642-30574-0_62&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fbrain-aging-accelerates-dramatically-around-age-44-could-ketone-supplements-help" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Allen Brain Atlas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which includes data on the activity of the GLUT4 gene, and found that the fast-aging regions did depend more on GLUT4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slow-aging brain regions, on the other hand, had higher levels of a protein that moves ketones into cells, suggesting that those regions use ketones as an alternative energy source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/biological-aging-may-not-be-driven-by-what-we-thought" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/biological-aging-may-not-be-driven-by-what-we-thought"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological aging may not be driven by what we thought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ketone-supplements-3"&gt;Ketone supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That raised the question of whether ketone supplements might be able to slow brain aging. To test this idea, the team recruited 53 men and 48 women, ages 20 to 79, who got fMRI scans after fasting overnight to deprive the brain of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half an hour after the scan, the participants received either a ketone-filled drink or a sugary drink with the same number of calories. The researchers then waited 30 minutes for the energy source to reach the participants' brains, before repeating the fMRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even over this short time frame, the ketone drink appeared to reduce brain network disruptions tied to aging, while the glucose beverage didn't, the team found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ketone drink had the greatest effect on people ages 40 to 59, where its impact was over 80% higher than in younger adults ages 20 to 39. The ketone drink had the smallest effect in the 60-to-79 age group. That might hint that, if ketone supplements prove to be effective for slowing brain aging, early intervention could be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the study was limited in that the researchers tested the effects of ketone and glucose drinks only at a single time point; they didn't monitor brain aging over time or conduct any cognitive tests. They also considered only specific fMRI data, which may not reflect all aspects of brain aging, so we don't know if ketone supplements would help across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mujica-Parodi said future studies could track brain aging in people taking these supplements over time and thus provide more insight into its long-term potential. In addition, if the ketone supplements are making up for insulin resistance, the best measure people could take might be to avoid developing insulin resistance in the first place, she suggested, which could be achieved through &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html#section-insulin-resistance-and-diet" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html#section-insulin-resistance-and-diet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dietary changes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soto-Mota added that when glucose levels are low enough, the body can make more ketones on its own than it can obtain from supplements. That's the goal of the "keto diet," although maintaining the diet for a long time &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/nutrition/pros-and-cons-of-ketogenic-diet" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/nutrition/pros-and-cons-of-ketogenic-diet" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;comes with downsides&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mujica-Parodi said that ketone supplements could be helpful in people with extreme insulin resistance who are incapable of making their own ketones, due to metabolic changes in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: Some of the authors on the new paper have patented the ketone supplement tested in the research, and one is the director of a company aimed at developing products based on the science of ketone bodies in human nutrition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-rAHnU32GwaDiVQc5NzfP6D-gg5pz1v4dKhPwnMYG8evW0TOqj2D5blz" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-rAHnU32GwaDiVQc5NzfP6D-gg5pz1v4dKhPwnMYG8evW0TOqj2D5blz slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body"&gt;Brain quiz&lt;/a&gt;: Test your knowledge of the most complex organ in the body&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A modified pig liver transplanted into a human patient appears to have functioned normally for the duration of the investigation with no signs of rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 10 days, the liver performed its basic metabolic functions in a patient diagnosed with brain death, according to a team of doctors led by Kai-Shan Tao, Zhao-Xu Yang, Xuan Zhang, and Hong-Tao Zhang of the Fourth Military Medical University in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time the transplantation of a pig liver has been described in a peer-reviewed publication, offering hope for patients of late-stage liver disease for whom transplants are often the only treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the world's first case of a transplant of a genetically modified pig liver into a brain-dead human," says nephrologist Rafael Matesanz of the National Transplant Organization in Spain, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is an important experiment, which opens up a different path to what has been tried so far in both vital organs (heart) and non-vital organs (kidney), such as the temporary replacement of the diseased liver until a human liver can be obtained for the definitive transplant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156311" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/transplant-schematic.jpg" alt="A Transplanted Pig Liver Has Successfully Functioned in a Human Patient" class="size-full wp-image-156311" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/transplant-schematic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/transplant-schematic-600x340.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156311" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A schematic diagram of the surgery.

One possible solution is xenotransplantation – taking an organ from a genetically modified animal and using it as a temporary '&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2778799/"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;' until a compatible human donor becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156303" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; on the method have so far looked promising. In 2023, a &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/01/18/1086791/brain-dead-man-gene-edited-pig-liver/"&gt;genetically modified pig liver&lt;/a&gt; was attached externally to a brain-dead patient's body for three days. Experiments with genetically modified pig kidneys have gone further; multiple different teams have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/for-the-first-time-pig-kidneys-transplanted-into-a-human-provide-life-sustaining-function"&gt;reported normal functioning&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-pig-kidney-transplant-was-a-huge-breakthrough-but-is-it-the-future"&gt;transplantation inside brain-dead patients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver functions are more complex than those of the kidney, which makes transplantation a more difficult prospect. Not all scientists have considered it even&lt;span&gt; possible, especially since the fats, proteins, and glucose produced by a pig's liver could provoke a strong immune response in humans that is difficult to suppress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a brain-dead patient – that is, &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/brain-death"&gt;a person without brain functions&lt;/a&gt; considered vital for life – Tao and his team have now successfully transplanted a liver harvested from a genetically modified pig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156309" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156309" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/genetically-modified-pig.jpg" alt="A Transplanted Pig Liver Has Successfully Functioned in a Human Patient" class="size-full wp-image-156309" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/genetically-modified-pig.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/genetically-modified-pig-582x415.jpg 582w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/genetically-modified-pig-600x428.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156309" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The genetically modified donor pig.

They included the removal of genes that mediate hyperacute rejection and the insertion of human genes to make the organ more compatible with the human body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the transplant took place, it was not a complete replacement of the patient's liver, but what is known as an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2020657/"&gt;auxiliary transplant&lt;/a&gt;. The original liver is not removed, but left intact; the pig liver is placed in another position in the abdominal cavity, connected up, and monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was terminated after 10 days at the request of the patient's family, but the liver remained functional until the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient's immune system didn't reject the implant thanks to the judicious application of immunosuppressants that inhibited T-cell and B-cell activity. Meanwhile, blood flow through the transplanted liver was maintained at a good velocity, and the liver itself produced both bile and porcine albumin, as a liver ought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156310" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/bile.jpg" alt="A Transplanted Pig Liver Has Successfully Functioned in a Human Patient" class="size-full wp-image-156310" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/bile.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/bile-600x247.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156310" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bile secreted by the transplanted liver.

&lt;p&gt;What the study does show is that the genetic modifications prevent hyperacute organ rejection and the low platelet count associated with xenotransplantation. This means it's a viable option for further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study represents a milestone in the history of liver xenotransplantation, describing for the first time a transplantation of a genetically modified porcine liver into a human being (in this case, a brain-dead human)," says neuropathologist Iván Fernández Vega of the University of Oviedo, who was not associated with the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The quality of the work is very high, both in terms of scientific rigour and the exhaustive clinical, immunological, histological and haemodynamic characterisation of the procedure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more to learn. Only bile and albumin production were assessed, the most basic markers of liver function. The study only included a single patient. That's understandable, but it does mean that the results can't be widely extrapolated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it's another promising step, suggesting a future potential lifeline for patients experiencing liver failure with no other treatment options while they await a human transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08799-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Around 700 people are currently on the waiting list for a transplant, and the average wait is three to four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The announcement follows a slew of recent breakthroughs, including transplanting a pig’s heart into a man and a woman currently living with a pig’s kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The surgery team at Xijing Hospital implanting the genetically modified pig liver into a person as part of a nine-hour procedure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Lin Wang, one of the study’s authors from the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi’an, said: ‘The liver collected from the modified pig functioned very well in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s a great achievement. This surgery was really successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We examined the blood flow in the different vessels and arteries. The flow is very smooth. It functioned very well.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experiment was terminated after 10 days because of requests made by the patient’s family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, published in the journal Nature, suggest modified livers can survive and function in human bodies, but further research on long-term outcomes is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We have the opportunity in the future to solve the problem of a patient with severe liver failure,’ Professor Wang added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is our dream to make this achievement. The pig liver could survive together with the original liver of the human being and maybe it will give it additional support.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also expressed a desire to conduct further research on living, non-brain-dead human beings in the future, but stressed the complications and ‘many rules’ around this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The seven-month-old Bama miniature pig had been genetically modified to reduce the risk of rejection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, a team at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia connected a clinically dead person to a genetically modified pig’s liver located outside their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is the first time, however, a pig liver has been transplanted into a human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rafael Matesanz, founder of the National Transplant Organisation in Spain, said: ‘This is the world’s first case of a transplant of a genetically modified pig liver into a brain-dead human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The ultimate goal of the experiment was not to achieve a standard liver transplant, but to serve as a ‘bridge organ’ in cases of acute liver failure, while awaiting a human organ for a definitive transplant.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iván Fernández Vega, Professor of Pathological Anatomy at the University of Oviedo in Spain, described the procedure as a ‘milestone’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The clinical implications are highly relevant, as optimising this approach could expand the pool of available organs and save lives in liver emergencies,’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is the first study to demonstrate that a genetically modified porcine liver can survive and exert basic metabolic functions - albumin and bile production - in the human body.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage liver diseases, but the demand for donor livers far exceeds the supply, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 10 days, the donor liver successfully produced bile and maintained a stable blood flow within the human recipient &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pigs are being considered as an alternative source of organs owing to their compatible physiological functions and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pig for this surgery was provided by Doctor Deng-Ke Pan at Clonorgan Biotechnology Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It contained six genetic modifications – the deactivation of three pig genes and the introduction of three genes for human proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was crucial to help prevent the recipient from rejecting the pig organ – a regular hurdle in animal-to-human transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The transplant follows more than 10 years of research into this process on animals. In 2013, scientists performed the first pig-to-monkey liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies into kidney and heart transplants from pigs to humans have also been successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But whilst those organs have mostly one function, the multi-functionality of the liver was a ‘huge obstacle for us to overcome,’ Professor Wang said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2022, a dying man in the US became the first patient in the world to get a heart transplant from a genetically-modified pig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; In 2022, in a medical first, doctors transplanted a pig heart into a patient in a last-ditch effort to save his life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Left is Dr. Bartley Griffith, who conducted the heart transplant procedure, with David Bennett (right) after the surgery was completed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;David Bennett, who was suffering from terminal heart failure, underwent a nine-hour operation at the University of Maryland Medical Centre in Baltimore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 57-year-old survived for two months following the surgery, with doctors describing him as a ‘brave and noble patient who fought all the way to the end’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in November last year, Towana Looney became the fifth living person to receive a gene-edited pig kidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since made history as the longest-living recipient, and says she feels ‘like superwoman’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time a new class of antibiotics reached the market was nearly three decades ago—but that could soon change, thanks to a discovery by researchers at McMaster University.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;A team led by researcher Gerry Wright has identified a strong candidate to challenge even some of the most drug-resistant bacteria on the planet: a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/new+molecule/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;new molecule&lt;/a&gt; called lariocidin. The findings were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08723-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; on March 26, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the all-new class of antibiotics responds to a critical need for new antimicrobial medicines, as bacteria and other microorganisms evolve new ways to withstand existing drugs. This phenomenon is called antimicrobial resistance—or AMR—and it's one of the top global public health threats, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our old drugs are becoming less and less effective as bacteria become more and more resistant to them," explains Wright, a professor in McMaster's Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences and a researcher at the university's Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research. "About 4.5 million people die every year due to antibiotic-resistant infections, and it's only getting worse."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright and his team found that the new molecule, a lasso peptide, holds great promise as an early drug lead because it attacks bacteria in a way that's different from other antibiotics. Lariocidin binds directly to a bacterium's protein synthesis machinery in a completely new way, inhibiting its ability to grow and survive.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"This is a new molecule with a new mode of action," Wright says. "It's a big leap forward for us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lariocidin is produced by a type of bacteria called Paenibacillus, which the researchers retrieved from a soil sample collected from a Hamilton backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team allowed the soil bacteria to grow in the lab for approximately one year—a method that helped reveal even the slow-growing species that could have otherwise been missed. One of these bacteria, Paenibacillus, was producing a new substance that had strong activity against other bacteria, including those typically resistant to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we figured out how this new molecule kills other bacteria, it was a breakthrough moment," says Manoj Jangra, a postdoctoral fellow in Wright's lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to its unique mode of action and its activity against otherwise drug-resistant bacteria, the researchers are optimistic about lariocidin because it ticks a lot of the right boxes: it's not toxic to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human cells&lt;/a&gt;, it's not susceptible to existing mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and it also works well in an animal model of infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright and his team are now laser-focused on finding ways to modify the molecule and produce it in quantities large enough to allow for clinical development. Wright says because this new molecule is produced by bacteria—and "&lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; aren't interested in making new drugs for us"—much time and resources are needed before lariocidin is ready for market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The initial discovery—the big a-ha! moment—was astounding for us, but now the real hard work begins," Wright says. "We're now working on ripping this molecule apart and putting it back together again to make it a better drug candidate."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS — The University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy released research Wednesday that lays the groundwork for the first hormone-free male birth control pill to enter clinical trials.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, people with penises can either use condoms or vasectomies to prevent pregnancies. This would be the first hormone-free pill that would stop the production of sperm. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, called YCT-529, was 99% effective within four weeks in preventing pregnancies in mice trials, according to the University of Minnesota. YCT-529 lowered sperm counts in male non-human primates within two weeks of starting the drug. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the University of Minnesota, all test subjects regained fertility weeks after stopping the drug. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This study laid the groundwork for human clinical trials of YCT-529, which are progressing efficiently,” said Nadja Mannowetz, lead author, chief science officer and co-founder of YourChoice Therapeutics. “With the unintentional pregnancy rate at nearly 50% in the U.S. and globally, we need more contraceptive options, particularly for men.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drug is now undergoing safety and efficacy testing in a second clinical trial, according to the University of Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqq800153b73x88ragc4@published"&gt;My husband and I are expecting our first child this summer. He’s starting to freak out about it a lot. Or more likely: his ability to hide how much he’s freaking out is eroding. He had to be born by an emergency C-section, and his mother didn’t make it. I know he’s been to therapy over the issue, but it seems to have resurged in a big way, and it’s manifesting in him becoming jitteringly overprotective of me. I can’t even drive to the corner store without him insisting he go instead.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqqb00163b73a6zcf32d@published"&gt;I cannot stand the thought of months of this, but I also know he’s doing this from a place of deep psychological trauma, and I don’t want to damage him if I tell him to fuck off. I’m trying to coax him back into therapy, but he says, with some unfortunate truth, that it’s not an expense we can easily afford—not with a baby coming. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqqc00193b73h8xyjuzc@published"&gt;You’re totally correct here that there’s a balance you need to strike. On one hand, given his past, your husband’s jitteriness seems well justified. On the other hand, stress isn’t great if you’re pregnant—and you could explain to him that if he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants to protect you and the baby, he needs to chill out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqqc001a3b73r6ohbxl4@published"&gt;If his anxiety really can’t be controlled, and therapy truly isn’t an option, have him talk to his primary care physician. Uncontrolled anxiety is treatable in various ways, and his physician might have ideas or pharmaceutical interventions that could help. And, I’m not saying drugs should be the go-to solution, but I wonder if something like edibles could help him through this period until his anxiety about the birth has subsided. If he has an exercise routine, you could encourage him to lean into that to help manage stress as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3qqqd001b3b73cptpu8pn@published"&gt;All that said, if his anxiety isn’t causing you any adverse health effects—if this is more “very annoying” than “threatening my sense of wellbeing”— a few months of him being overprotective probably won’t break you. Tell him that you will in fact be driving to the store. If he’s stressing you out, tell him he needs to go take that stress away from you and the baby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdoe002h3b73dk2x20c8@published"&gt;Recently, we learned we are having a baby. I’m excited to be a father. But a while ago, the mother-to-be and I, “Claudia,” bought a house in need of major renovation work—which I’m doing all of—and we have Claudia’s sister living with us as well.They fight constantly to the point that I rented a house down the street to escape to (this was before the pregnancy). Claudia and I are more like friends than lovers but we’re both in that mid 30s range where it seems like “now or never,” and we’d both prefer “now.” I trust her and myself to be great parents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdof002i3b73uyuvzw8p@published"&gt;I’m wondering how to raise a kid as friends versus as conventional parents. I don’t think it’s crazy—but both of our families do. I’d like the sister to stick around as she’s a great person, but I understand that that’s not likely possible. The mortgage is expensive, however, and her contributions make a difference. The house is large enough that theoretically four of us—Claudia, the sister, the baby, and I—could live together in peace. Is it so wrong to have a child with someone you love and respect but don’t love as a romantic partner?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="175" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdof002l3b732240gfae@published"&gt;While your situation is unconventional, it’s not “wrong.” Plenty of children are raised successfully in a wide array of unconventional circumstances. As long as you feel like your friendship has a solid footing to withstand the trials of child-rearing, you should be OK. Your kids likely won’t even notice that you’re not romantically involved with each other. In my experience, children spend the first few years making sure you can’t sleep, and then the next few years asking for snacks or video games. Their self-absorption supposedly ends somewhere in their mid-to-late twenties. Perhaps, someday, your child will tell their AI therapist that they have trouble with intimacy because their parents were “more friends than lovers.” If that gives you pause, consider the hundreds of thousands of children raised by crappy parents, or parents who “stay together for the kids” and then end up fighting constantly (which is in fact a worse environment for the kids). If you can provide multiple loving good adult role models in your household, no matter their romantic whims, you’re winning.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="218" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3sdof002m3b730zf207yy@published"&gt;The part that worries me here is the fighting between Claudia and her sister. Having fights in the house that are so bad that they make you want to rent another apartment&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; a suboptimal environment in which to raise a child. The three of you need to sit down and figure out exactly what your expectations are for how everyone is going to contribute to the household, and live together. I can guarantee that adding a baby to the mix is going to change your circumstances drastically. Don’t wait for the baby to arrive to make a bunch of lifestyle changes. You’ll have your hands full. Start making changes now. Maybe sister can go live in the rental so the two of you can handle parenting duties. If Claudia is cool with you maintaining a separate place to escape to, make sure you’re using it for your mental health, but not to escape your parental responsibilities. If help with the mortgage is really what you need, perhaps you could rent a room to someone who isn’t related to you (with clear expectations in place about the fact that there is a baby on the way). Or maybe you set a deadline to sell the house (even if it’s in a few years) and move somewhere more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

If you get along, any sized space will work. If you’re always fighting, all the rooms in the world won’t make it any better.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgq001e3b73fw2eaccs@published"&gt;I have a daughter in high school, “Holly.” We don’t have the greatest school district, and the food they provide is filled with all sorts of processed crap that will kill you. I’ve made sure that she doesn’t have an account with the school cafeteria and instead I give her actually healthy lunches and snacks, mostly fruit and raw vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgu001f3b733ewlszn3@published"&gt;She’s been seeing this guy in some of her classes “John.” I’ve met him twice. He seems like a respectable young man, he gets very good grades, if a bit squeaky and timid around me. Ordinarily, I think he and Holly would be good for each other. But in the past few days, I’ve been noticing something that disturbs me on her school outfits.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3erk200283b73hryii9ti@published"&gt;There have been suspicious crumbs. I asked her about it, and I found out what he’s been doing:  sharing food with her at school, including stuff he gets from that awful cafeteria. She knows that’s against the rules, and bad for her besides, but she says “it’s different when he shares with me.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgu001g3b73wolm39po@published"&gt;That’s utter nonsense. Bad food is bad food, and the only difference is I suppose she’s only eating half of that crud if he’s poisoning himself with it too. I can’t exactly go over to the school and make sure she eats healthy, and I’m not so dumb that I think that telling her to stay away from her boyfriend is going to help. How can I make sure my daughter doesn’t harm herself with this stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgu001j3b73dfp5hjq2@published"&gt;Oh boy are you in for a rude awakening as your daughter becomes an adult and starts to make her own decisions. You need to come to terms with the fact that you cannot control your child forever. And, just like Leia told Tarkin in Star Wars Episode IV, “The more you tighten your grip, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.” A little deviation from an existing healthy diet isn’t going to kill her, and if you come down too hard, you might cause a rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="36" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgv001k3b73tztknqqn@published"&gt;Not to freak you out even more, but there are tons of foods that fall into the “not good for you” category that don’t leave crumbs! Gummy worms? No crumbs! Sodapop? No crumbs! Vaping? No crumbs!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgv001l3b733mijka91@published"&gt;You will not be around all the time to check for crumbs or gummy-worm residue. Instead, you’re going to have to (gasp) &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; your kid to make good choices, and to talk to you about the choices they’re making. It sounds like your daughter trusts you enough that she didn’t lie to you about where the crumbs came from, so at least you have some foundation of trust here. Keep the conversation going. Ask &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; she wants to eat foods that she wouldn’t eat otherwise when it’s with John. Put yourself in her shoes! If your boyfriend offers you half a Twix and your response is either (a) “that food will kill you” or (b) “my mom says I can’t,” neither of those responses are going to lead to a make out session. (And, especially if she’s never been allowed to have candy bars at home, a few bites of Twix might sound really good.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8q3ckgv001m3b737uy31a5u@published"&gt;Also, it doesn’t help to frame these foods as “bad,” “poisonous” or “killers” when she sees kids at school eating them all the time and they are still alive and well in the hallways. Sure, the American public school cafeteria diet is deplorable. But the effects of that diet take years and years to manifest. Also, for a lot of students, that’s the only food they’re going to eat that day. Looking down on that food as “bad food” could send the message that you think all those kids are choosing not to eat a healthy diet out of ignorance or recklessness. Disparaging all her classmates is another great way to increase the growing divide between the two of you. Work on treating her as an equal before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — Natalie Phelps was 38 when she gave birth to her second child and was blindsided by a life-altering diagnosis: colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news was a devastating blow.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To go home and look at your baby and think, 'I just gave birth to this baby and I might not get to see this baby grow up,'" Phelps recalled.  "It was crushing emotionally, but there was also a lot of disbelief and feelings of unfairness".&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phelps thought her symptoms -- weight loss, abdominal pain and unusual bowel movements -- were because of her pregnancy, not a sign of cancer.  She had no family history of colon cancer, so she never imagined it would be something so serious.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her primary care physician didn't initially consider cancer either. The doctor referred her to a therapist, suspecting that postpartum depression could be at the root of her symptoms. Phelps was simply too young for colon cancer, or so they thought.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a growing number of people under 50, like Phelps, are now being diagnosed with the disease, often years before they're due for their first recommended screening.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a 2023 report released by the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer cases among adults younger than 55 increased from 11% in 1995 to 20% in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's now the deadliest cancer among young men and the second deadliest among young women.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rachel Issaka, gastroenterologist and researcher at Fred Hutch Cancer Center, has dedicated her career to studying the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer and its disparities.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think there is this misconception that colon cancer is an older person's disease, Dr. Issaka said.  "In some settings, there's even a misconception that it's only an older man's disease. And that's not true at all."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why screening guidelines changed in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommended age to begin screening used to be age 50.  People are now advised to begin screenings at age 45, with those having a family history of the disease potentially starting even earlier. Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for detection, as it can identify polyps before they turn into cancer. Additionally, a stool test and a new blood test, approved by the FDA last year, are now available options for early detection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This blood test is looking for circulating tumor DNA, and what that means is that cancers in the body can release specific signals that suggest that those are cancer cells compared to normal cells," Dr. Issaka said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is often called a "silent" disease. By the time symptoms appear, the cancer may already be in an advanced stage. However, when caught early, the five-year survival rate for colon cancer can be as high as 90%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Phelps was diagnosed, her cancer was at stage four.  Today, she is committed to raising awareness about the importance of screenings and the lack of funding for colorectal cancer research.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 30, the Seattle Mariners are hosting &lt;a title="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/tickets/specials/colorectal-cancer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.mlb.com/mariners/tickets/specials/colorectal-cancer"&gt;Strike Out Against Colorectal Cancer Day&lt;/a&gt;.  For every ticket sold, $8 will benefit the Colorectal Cancer Alliance's 2025 &lt;a title="https://impact.ccalliance.org/event/2025-seattle-walk-to-end-colon-cancer/e619275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://impact.ccalliance.org/event/2025-seattle-walk-to-end-colon-cancer/e619275"&gt;Seattle Walk to End Colon Cancer&lt;/a&gt; -- an event Phelps helps co-organize.  She'll be at the Mariners game helping to spark a conversation about a topic many people avoid.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We'll be having a game where you toss poo in a toilet, and then you get to keep a little ice pack shaped like poop," Phelps said. "Then you get this little QR code that is a quiz. You can take it home in private, and it'll ask you all the embarrassing questions about your poo. But at least with that, I'm hoping people will do that and start thinking and paying attention to their body and advocating if they are having symptoms or concerns with their primary doctor."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a685040.html"&gt;Lupron&lt;/a&gt; is a drug that suppresses sex hormones (a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist) and is used to treat prostate cancer, endometriosis, and precocious (early) puberty. It can also be used for &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/22402-chemical-castration"&gt;chemical castration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mbp.state.md.us/BPQAPP/orders/GeierOrder07.302.pdf"&gt;In a linked case&lt;/a&gt;, the state physician's board also found that David Geier, who worked closely with his father, was practicing medicine without a license. He was issued a civil fine of $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Numerous conceptual and scientific flaws”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two Geiers have published &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Geier+DA&amp;amp;cauthor_id=28595786"&gt;a long list of questionable studies&lt;/a&gt; in obscure journals claiming to find harms of vaccines and links to autism. One focus of their work has been to claim that thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative previously used in vaccines, causes autism. No credible evidence of harms from thimerosal has been found, according to the CDC. And regardless, the preservative was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html"&gt;largely removed from vaccines in 1999&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of their articles have drawn widespread criticism from scientific and medical experts, including the American Academy of Pediatrics. In 2003, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030604060812/http:/aap.org/profed/thimaut-may03.htm"&gt;the AAP blasted one of their articles&lt;/a&gt; that claimed to find a link between thimerosal and autism. The AAP said the paper "contains numerous conceptual and scientific flaws, omissions of fact, inaccuracies, and misstatements."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Post reached David Geier for comment on his role in the HHS and how he was hired, Geier said, "I don’t have any comment to say. Talk to the secretary [Kennedy]. He’s the person that’s in charge."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To experts, the conclusion of Geier's upcoming CDC study on vaccines and autism is a foregone one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It seems the goal of this administration is to prove that vaccines cause autism, even though they don’t," Alison Singer, president of the Autism Science Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds autism research, told the Post. "They are starting with the conclusion and looking to prove it. That’s not how science is done."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON D.C., DC — Health officials say Minnesota has recorded its first measles case of 2025, a rare instance where someone who has been vaccinated contracts the virus. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple media reports say the unidentified person traveled from Minnesota to Washington D.C. and visited multiple locations over three days before feeling ill and going to an urgent care, where they were diagnosed. DC Health issued an alert Tuesday, saying the individual may have exposed large numbers of people while riding an Amtrak train and walking through a concourse in Union Station, among other stops. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; KARE 11 reporter Michelle Baik looked up that train's itinerary and found that passengers could have been exposed to the contagious person during stops in Boston, New York and Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post reports the Minnesotan was not contagious when they flew into the nation's capital, adding that they were vaccinated and appear to be recovering. The Centers for Disease Control says the measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after exposure for those who have received two doses, and 93% effective for those who have received a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials say you are at increased risk of getting measles if you've never had the disease or gotten vaccinated. Symptoms of the virus include fever, rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declining vaccination rates following the COVID pandemic are blamed for several recent measles outbreaks, including situations in West Texas and New Mexico that involve nearly 300 infections. In 2025, a total of 378 cases have been reported in 18 jurisdictions across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jayne Griffith, Minnesota Department of Health epidemiologist, gave the following statement to KARE 11 Wednesday morning: &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"On March 24, a case of measles was confirmed in an adult who lives in Hennepin County and had recently traveled domestically and internationally. The person was not infectious while in Minnesota, so there were no exposures in Minnesota from this case. We are still investigating where this person acquired measles."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.chtbl.com/7O9PGLwf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8nj1e70001r26p430xt1dih@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (&lt;strong&gt;CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;Puberty: It’s one of the most important milestones in a young person’s life. It’s also one of the most awkward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000g3b6myzkotptx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hormonal shifts lead to massive changes in body and mind, including growth spurts beyond just height, hair growth beyond just the head, mood swings beyond just tantrums and, for most, a sexual awakening. The process can be fraught with anxiety, insecurity and emotional upheaval for all involved, beyond the person going through it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000h3b6mjv5kjcwx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Puberty in its narrowest definition means the path to sexual maturation,” Dr. Cara Natterson&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000i3b6mq6z19hrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you start puberty, you cannot be part of a baby-making equation. And when you finish puberty, you can potentially be part of making a baby,” she said. The broader definition, she said, includes the effects from all of those sex hormones — estrogen, progesterone and testosterone — including “mood swings, friendship shifts, shifts in the way kids make decisions.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000j3b6mp8yfif09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Natterson, a pediatrician, is the author of the updated best-selling series for girls, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Care-Keeping-You-American-Wellbeing/dp/1683372301" target="_blank"&gt;The Care and Keeping of You&lt;/a&gt;,” and the ensuing separate volume for boys, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guy-Stuff-Body-Book-Boys/dp/1683370260/" target="_blank"&gt;Guy Stuff&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000k3b6mh8uc6iog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it wasn’t until her own children hit adolescence that she realized there wasn’t enough information out there. “My kids went into puberty, and it became very clear to me that we needed a whole lot more than  my little book and everyone else’s little books,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000l3b6m3hza1tez@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help fill that void and ratchet down the mystery (and sometimes shame) of this stage of life, she and a friend cocreated the platform &lt;a href="https://lessawkward.com/" target="_blank"&gt;lessawkward.com&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtf000m3b6mg5bt8err@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the process of puberty hasn’t changed, the timing has.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000n3b6m7gz5zlz0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Puberty (globally) is starting earlier, and we’ve known this for a long time,” Natterson said. This younger start might be happening for a variety of reasons, she said, including changes in average weight of children, environmental factors and relentless psycho-social stress.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000o3b6mr981kkzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm8njdb9000203b6m2q23if2r@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000q3b6mop1t9u2m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muddling the picture, puberty is often conflated with a separate, but closely related, biological process.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000r3b6mq0rznppi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s this thing called ‘adrenarche’ that is caused when the adrenal glands release their hormones, DHEA and DHEAS,” Natterson said, noting that they are cousins of estrogen and testosterone. These hormones tell the body to make more sweat and, in certain places, to make it with greasier, thicker proteins, and to sprout more hair.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000s3b6myn25aykn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It happens around the same time as puberty, but in some kids, it can happen much earlier. So, a 5-year-old can have pubic hair, and they’re not in puberty. Or a 15-year-old can be well through puberty and have no body odor, no greasiness and no pubic hair growth. It’s confusing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000t3b6mmpb7hfm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Should parents worry? And if so, when?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000u3b6mtzc350yv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any adult who thinks the kid in their life is going into puberty and they have a question or a concern, reach out to a health care provider,” Natterson said . The pediatrician will talk to your child and also perform a physical exam to determine what, exactly, is going on. A parent may be asked to wait outside, depending on the child’s age, but can ask questions after.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000v3b6mwpna024o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to help your child navigate this potentially challenging stage of life?  Natterson wants parents to keep these five things in mind.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000w3b6mw0tbig0c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The (average) age is 8-9 for girls and 9-10 for boys, which means it is happening 2-3 years sooner than it did for many of us,” Natterson said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000x3b6m2a5xmxkq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said that when she was in medical school, students were taught that the start of puberty, typically with the onset of breast development, begins at 11 or 11 and a half. But then a groundbreaking &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/99/4/505/75275/Secondary-Sexual-Characteristics-and-Menses-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;study of 17,000 girls&lt;/a&gt; was published in 1997, showing that the average age for the start of breast development was 9.96 years for White girls and  8.87 years for Black girls.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000y3b6m1dp0v0fz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another study of more than 1,200 girls, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20696727/" target="_blank"&gt;published in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, sought to confirm those findings. “And it didn’t just confirm it, it moved the starting point even further,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg000z3b6mqqhrg94c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Starting in 2010 … we knew that the average age of breast development for a girl fell somewhere between 8 and 9 in this country,” she said. “And for boys, the start of puberty looks like testicular and penile growth, which frankly, most parents have no idea is happening … That average age is between 9 and 10.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00103b6my5r1kn5s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s different — that’s two years different — from when we were growing up,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00113b6mi0e77tt7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So what is a “normal” age to show signs of puberty?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00123b6mdu3w1fjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before age 7 for a girl, before age 8 for a boy … (if) you start seeing changes in the body, you want to bring in a medical thinker,” Natterson said. “But you noticed I’m not using the word ‘concerned’ or ‘worried’ because there are a lot of red herrings here. There are a lot of things that can look like puberty that aren’t puberty.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00133b6mwye3mmjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Oh, and by the way, if they’re 12 and nothing has happened, that is also normal,” she said. “So now wrap your brain around a five- or six-year spread of ‘normal’ onset of body changes. That’s really hard for everyone to manage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00143b6mdf25iuxa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not moving faster, but rather slower!” Natterson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00153b6mo3ig9dmj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She was taught, again in medical school, that puberty takes about two to four years. “It’s a sprint, and you get through it, and it’s super awkward, and your body changes, and then you’re done,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00163b6mc35w96es@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But nowadays, Natterson said, “it takes nearly a decade for kids to get through it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00173b6m4lpf2ssw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coming of age is radically different today compared to 20 years ago in part thanks to screens, Natterson pointed out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00183b6myf567fmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Devices — cellphones  for sure, but also iPads and laptops and video consoles, too — are shifting the ways kids travel through their tween and teen years both physically and emotionally,” she said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg00193b6m6c0jyu8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Take sleep. The devices themselves, both their engrossing content and their blue light, keep kids up later into the night, in turn reducing their sleep. When devices are kept in the bedroom, pinging notifications interrupt sleep or prevent us from entering deep sleep cycles,” she said. “Less sleep impacts everything from their metabolism to their growth. Emotionally, too little sleep reduces focus and exacerbates mental health issues and shifts overall mood, all of which affect friendships, sibling dynamics, romantic relationships, and more.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001a3b6mjk8b6gm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Interrupted sleep is just one example of the impact of screens, Natterson said. “Their very content has direct effects on self-esteem, risk taking behaviors, choices about what to put into and onto their bodies,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001b3b6mt3si10b4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And that content might also include pornography.      “The average age of first porn viewing in this country is 12 … and 15% of 10-year-olds have seen it,” she said. (Those statistics are based on teens’ self-reported use of pornography in &lt;a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/new-report-reveals-truths-about-how-teens-engage-with-pornography" target="_blank"&gt;a 2022 survey&lt;/a&gt; from Common Sense Media.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001c3b6mmmz9dj0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’re not having conversations like this — about all of this: smells and feelings and sex and all of it — if you’re not having those conversations with the kids in your lives, someone else is,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm8njaijl001r3b6mjzrstu5k@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="puberty-affects-the-body-and-brain" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Puberty affects the body and brain
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001d3b6merir7b1x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The same sex hormones that change the body also impact the brain,” Natterson said, “which explains everything from mood swings to social shifts to decision making.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001e3b6muife0bbz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sex hormones  — whether they are estrogen and progesterone, which govern female puberty, or testosterone, which governs male puberty — they circle around the brain. They change the way the neurons fire. They change the way moods are expressed,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001f3b6mnx4om8vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(Pediatric endocrinologist and researcher) Louise Greenspan says the first sign of puberty is not breast development or penile and testicular growth. It is a slamming door. I love that line; it is absolutely true,” she said. “That is, all those hormones rising and falling and coursing through the brain and changing the way the brain feels and the way it reacts — it has to be a setup for mental health issues if we are not talking about it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001g3b6me4pq7vm8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally conversations that take place “many, many times over many years,” Natterson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001h3b6miaxvszk2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s one piece of advice  I can give the adults who care about kids, it’s this: realize that they’re interested in being in the conversation with you, even if they don’t speak,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001i3b6mkn6wthd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Ask them questions, and then zip it and listen to what they have to say. Because if you can stop filling the space with your own words, you’re going to learn how much all of these outside factors are bearing down on their life. They just need space to speak.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            That said, it might be awkward, and it might be hard. To talk to her son, Natterson said she would sit outside of his closed bedroom door and chat; over time that door opened. “He was almost invariably sitting at his desk in his chair, and I would go lay down on his bed and look straight up at the ceiling, and I’d be like, ‘Hey, dude, how you doing?’ And he’d start talking. No eye contact,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001k3b6mo46wl19r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But my laying on his bed and him sitting at his desk with his back to me was a place and a way that we could get into some of our best conversations.” Other similar no-eye-contact locations are in the car and on walks, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001l3b6m549urmy4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also, it might not go perfectly. “When  you mess the conversation up, which we all do (!), just take a do-over and try again,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8njahtg001m3b6mf88ty6oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remi Bader is coming clean about undergoing weight-loss surgery after sidestepping speculation for months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The influencer &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/remi-bader-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;opened up to Self&lt;/a&gt; about her single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy in an interview published Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She spoke about having the procedure, which involved “cut[ting] out 80 percent of [her] stomach,” in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Remi Bader revealed her weight-loss surgery after months of speculation. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Remi Bader/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The influencer told Self about choosing to have a single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;remibader/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She shared the same on “Khloé in Wonder Land.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Khloe Kardashian/X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Bader said she chose the surgery after struggling with debilitating back pain, excessive sweat, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, heart issues, fatty liver disease and infertility fears.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, after the 30-year-old went under the knife, she spent “hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up” — and despite being discharged from the hospital after three days, she continued vomiting for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bader subsequently fell into a “very, very deep depression” and “wanted to die.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The procedure involved cutting out “80 percent” of the model’s stomach. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Remi Bader/Instagram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The “brutal” recovery led to Bader falling into a “deep depression.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images for The Recording Academy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The TikTok star, who has since been prescribed antidepressants, told the magazine how she is doing one year post-op.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My binge eating is better,” she explained. “I’m still struggling and I have those thoughts, but I can’t physically binge as much because I don’t have the room for it. You cannot drink and eat within the same 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes I’m out to dinner with friends, and I run to the bathroom. It’s also hard; I’m going to these events and dinners, and I’m constantly getting sick,” Bader continued, saying she also suffered hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bader lost “more than 140 pounds in less than a year.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;GC Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She called the “quick” transformation “confusing.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While reflecting on her “quick” transformation, Baden admitted that it has been “really confusing to be … in a different body but have the exact same brain” because she “never wanted to be this size” and wished to remain “curvy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model &lt;a href="https://x.com/i/events/1875987636159905792" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shared more of her story on Wednesday’s episode of the “Khloé in Wonder Land” podcast&lt;/a&gt;, revealing she lost “more than 140 pounds in less than a year”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She clarified that &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/article/celebrities-who-used-ozempic-for-weight-loss/"&gt;taking Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; was just a “Band Aid” for her prior to her surgery — but doubled down on the “brutal” recovery being the “worst” experience of her life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bader said she “never wanted to be this size” and liked being “curvy.” &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/@remibader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;She stopped publicly speaking about her weight in 2023 due to “ridiculous” body shaming. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Instagram/@remibader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bader has not been speaking publicly about her weight and her health since September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time, she &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2023/09/18/remi-bader-sobs-as-she-begs-followers-to-stop-commenting-on-weight-gain/"&gt;sobbed while begging “disgusting” trolls to stop&lt;/a&gt; their “ridiculous … &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/06/14/remi-bader-turned-away-at-montauk-ranch-called-fat-bitch/"&gt;body-shaming” over her fluctuating figure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My health journey will now be my business,” Bader said. “It’s really not fair to just see really mean, mean things. I’m taking care of myself the best that I can.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/newronika-receives-ce-mark-approval-for-alphadbs-advancing-adaptive-deep-brain-stimulation-for-parkinsons-disease-302408062.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;, in which Newronika called the award of the CE Mark a “regulatory milestone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The CE Mark approval of AlphaDBS is a defining moment for Newronika,” said Lorenzo Rossi, PhD, the company’s cofounder and chief technology officer. “This certification validates our vision of bringing truly adaptive neuromodulation to patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the EU, a CE Mark is required for products to be sold commercially — it ensures that companies worldwide meet the same standards. Such certification confirms that AlphaDBS complies with the safety, health, and environmental protection regulations set by the European Commission, the EU’s regulatory authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Newronika is planning to launch a pivotal clinical trial in the U.S. as the company “[advances] its global expansion,” the release stated. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Newronika an investigational device exemption that will allow it to be used in a clinical study, per the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Adaptive DBS allows for customized stimulation in patients’ brains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, or nerve cells that produce dopamine, a signaling molecule involved in motor control. The loss of these cells disrupts the normal circuitry of the brain, leading to &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;disease symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that include tremor, rigidity, and slowed movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS is a surgical treatment for &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;Parkinson’s motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that aims to normalize the brain’s electrical activity by delivering targeted electrical stimulation. Such treatment has been shown to help restore a more typical nerve-firing pattern and, in turn, ease disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The procedure involves implanting fine wires attached to electrodes in target brain regions, which are connected to a small pacemaker-like device placed under the skin. That device delivers the electrical signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional DBS delivers constant stimulation at fixed parameters, while adaptive DBS allows for customized stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AlphaDBS monitors patients’ brain activity and automatically adjusts stimulation levels based on real-time feedback from the brain. According to the company, this personalized approach minimizes the need for frequent adjustments in delivered stimulation, optimizing symptom control and reducing side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;We are excited to bring this technology to market. …  [Newronika is aiming] to set a new standard in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system is a closed-loop design that records and analyzes brain signals in the areas where stimulation is applied, adjusting in real time to meet the patient’s needs. Brain activity data collected during therapy can be shared via the cloud, allowing physicians to monitor it remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to bring this technology to market,” Rossi said, adding that Newronika is aiming “to set a new standard in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CE Mark approval was based on results from a &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04681534"&gt;clinical trial (NCT04547712&lt;/a&gt;) that assessed the device’s safety and efficacy compared with conventional DBS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients initially received conventional and adaptive DBS through AlphaDBS during hospitalization, followed by one-month treatment for certain individuals at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants first underwent two days of experimental sessions during hospitalization, with one day for each type of stimulation. Patients were then assessed by neurologists, and those who did not experience severe side effects could continue into the long-term follow-up phase at home for one month, where they received two weeks of stimulation with each mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the FDA earlier this year &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/fda-approves-medtronic-adaptive-deep-brain-stimulation-system/"&gt;approved an adaptive DBS system&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/index.html"&gt;Medtronic&lt;/a&gt; to treat people with Parkinson’s disease. That system has also &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/medtronic-adaptive-dbs-system-receives-ce-mark-europe/"&gt;earned a CE Mark approval&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings highlight that even small bursts of movement can have profound cognitive effects, making exercise an accessible and essential brain-health strategy for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Cognitive Boosts:&lt;/strong&gt; Yoga, Tai Chi, and exergames showed the strongest improvements in memory and cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Gains in brain function were observed within just 1–3 months of regular exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Low- to moderate-intensity exercise benefited all age groups, especially children and those with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether it’s an early morning jog, or a touch of Tai Chi, groundbreaking research from the University of South Australia shows that any form of exercise can significantly boost brain function and memory across children, adults, and older adults.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the largest, most comprehensive umbrella review to date, researchers found that regular exercise improves general cognition, memory, and executive function in both healthy individuals and those with clinical conditions, reinforcing exercise as an essential, inclusive activity for optimising cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108246"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man running." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/exercise-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Senior researcher, Professor Carol Maher says exercise should be encouraged as a cognitive health strategy across all ages and fitness levels. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synthesising findings from 133 systematic reviews, covering 2724 randomised controlled trials and 258,279 participants, the systematic umbrella and meta-meta-analysis found that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;low- to moderate-intensity exercise had the greatest benefits for brain function and memory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;children and adolescents showed the greatest improvements in memory, while people with ADHD saw the biggest gains in executive function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;yoga, Tai Chi, and exergames (active video games) delivered the most significant cognitive benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher, UniSA’s Dr Ben Singh, says the findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how different types, intensities, and durations of exercise influence cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise has a profound effect on physical health, but we also know it benefits brain function. What this study confirms is that even low-intensity exercise – like yoga or walking – can improve cognition, making it accessible to people of all ages and abilities,” Dr Singh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In particular, we found that benefits were delivered quickly – with clear gains within 1-3 months, highlighting that even small bursts of activity can make a big difference. It also signals that trying out new activities could play a key role in keeping the brain engaged and active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For children and teens, exercise was especially beneficial for developing memory, while for people with ADHD, it helped improve focus, reduce impulsivity, and enhance executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also found that mind-body exercises, like Tai Chi and yoga, had the most significant impact on memory, while exergames – such as Pokémon Go – were highly effective for general cognition. This is an encouraging finding, as it suggests that engaging, low-impact activities can offer real cognitive benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior researcher, Professor Carol Maher says exercise should be encouraged as a cognitive health strategy across all ages and fitness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases are growing global health concerns, underscoring the urgent need to identify effective strategies to preserve and enhance cognitive function across the lifespan,” Prof Maher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study presents compelling evidence that exercise should be integrated into healthcare and education settings to promote cognitive well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing that even small amounts of exercise can improve memory and brain function – especially for those at higher risk – presents a clear opportunity for exercise to be included in clinical and public health guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ddcf3f3fcfff8f1b3d0fcf3eefbf4f8f1f9dde8f3f4eefcb3f8f9e8b3fce8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Annabel Mansfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unisa.edu.au"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Annabel Mansfield – University of South Australia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/06/bjsports-2024-108589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effectiveness of exercise for improving cognition, memory and executive function: a systematic umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Ben Singh et al. &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effectiveness of exercise for improving cognition, memory and executive function: a systematic umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-2"&gt;To evaluate systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of exercise on general cognition, memory and executive function across all populations and ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="p-3"&gt;Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs evaluating the effects of exercise on general cognition, memory and executive function were eligible.

			&lt;p&gt;We're still not sure exactly what causes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, but we know what its effects look like, and we're getting better at detecting the early signs of it – including, perhaps, those in our speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Boston University have developed a new AI ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="156305" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Types-of-AI-algorithms-and-how-they-work"&gt;algorithm&lt;/a&gt; that analyzes the speech patterns of those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6O1cNKoCPw"&gt;predict a progression&lt;/a&gt; from MCI to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="156305" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; within six years with an accuracy of 78.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team's study, published in 2024, continues their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.064029"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt;, where they trained a model – using voice recordings from over 1,000 individuals – to accurately detect cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6O1cNKoCPw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their new algorithm was trained on transcribed audio recordings of 166 individuals with MCI, aged 63–97.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the team already knew who had developed Alzheimer's, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; approach could be used to find signs in &lt;span&gt;their transcribed speech&lt;/span&gt; that linked the 90 people whose cognitive function would decline into Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the algorithm could then be applied in reverse: to try and predict Alzheimer's risk from transcripts of speech samples it had never processed before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other important factors, including age and self-reported sex, were added to produce a final predictive score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145445" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI.jpg" alt="A graph with blue columns " class="size-full wp-image-145445" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/YearsToAlzheimersFromMCI-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145445" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Number of MCI patients transitioning to Alzheimer's disease (AD) annually over six years. (Amini et al., &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alz.13886"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can think of the score as the likelihood, the probability, that someone will remain stable or transition to dementia," &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/new-ai-program-could-predict-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; computer scientist Ioannis Paschalidis from Boston University, when the results were published in June last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to predict what would happen in the next six years – and we found we can reasonably make that prediction with relatively good confidence and accuracy. It shows the power of AI."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering there's currently no cure for Alzheimer's, you might wonder what the benefit of detecting it early is – but we do have treatments that &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/treatments"&gt;can help manage Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; to some extent, and these can be started earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, early detection gives us more opportunity to study the disease and its progression, and from there develop a fully effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those known to be likely to develop Alzheimer's can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-alzheimers-trial-shows-new-drug-can-slow-disease-progression"&gt;participate in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145446" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145446" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech.jpg" alt="Gaphic of the automated pipeline for Alzheimer's disease prediction from a neuropsychological test interview." class="size-full wp-image-145446" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/PredictingAlzheimersFromSpeech-600x245.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145446" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The prediction process.

It's the sort of test that could be done quickly and inexpensively, even at home, and without any specialist equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't need any injections or samples, just a recording, and it could even be run through a smartphone app in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you can predict what will happen, you have more of an opportunity and time window to intervene with drugs, and at least try to maintain the stability of the condition and prevent the transition to more severe forms of dementia," Paschalidis &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/new-ai-program-could-predict-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recordings used here were rather rough and of low quality. With cleaner recordings and data, the algorithm's accuracy is likely to get even better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg" alt="An older woman with grey hair and glasses, talking on the phone" class="size-full wp-image-145448" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Early detection of Alzheimer's gives us more opportunity to study the disease and its progression.

&lt;p&gt;"We hope, as everyone does, that there will be more and more Alzheimer's treatments made available," &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/new-ai-program-could-predict-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Paschalidis.&lt;/p&gt;

In some cases, it may even lead to abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the Lebanese man did not present any such symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Louis Chaptini, senior author of the new case report said: 'That's the part that makes this case so fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The patient didn't have the classic symptoms. No heartburn. No food impaction. Just hiccups that wouldn't go away.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being able to identify his condition through his blood test, the experts involved found it difficult to understand how eosinophilic esophagitis was causing him to constantly hiccup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, they theorized the buildup of eosinophils in his esophagus might have triggered impulses in the vagal nerve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Louis Chaptini, senior author of the new case report noted that the patient did not show any regular symptoms of the condition &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To test the theory, the doctors gave him a topical steroid to use, which helped cure his hiccups and he found relief within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His eosinophil count also dropped back to a normal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors concluded: 'EoE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with chronic refractory hiccups even when the typical symptoms of EoE are lacking, and prompt treatment with topical steroids should be considered.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no cure for the condition, treatments such as steroids and an acid blocker like a proton pump inhibitor can help address the inflammation and manage symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case was &lt;span&gt;published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-025-05044-1#Sec2"&gt;Journal of Medical Case Reports&lt;/a&gt; on March 6. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/us/philadelphia-pennsylvania-news"&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;’s street opioid supply – or “dope” market – is constantly changing. As health care &lt;a href="https://www.jefferson.edu/academics/colleges-schools-institutes/skmc/departments/emergency-medicine/faculty-staff/faculty/london.html"&gt;workers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://profiles.jefferson.edu/display/33591"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; who care for people who use drugs in our community, we have witnessed these shifts firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New adulterants are frequently added to the mix. They bring additional and often uncertain risks for people who use drugs, and new challenges for the health care providers and systems who treat them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest adulterant to dominate the supply is medetomidine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is medetomodine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medetomidine, pronounced meh-deh-TOH-muh-deen, is a drug used in veterinary medicine for sedation, muscle relaxation and pain relief, often during surgery. It is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, which essentially means it works by slowing the release of adrenaline in the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the Philadelphia Medical Examiner’s Office &lt;a href="https://hip.phila.gov/document/4874/PDPH-HAN-00444A-12-10-2024.pdf/"&gt;began testing for medetomidine&lt;/a&gt; in people who died from fatal overdoses. By the end of the year, 46 of the deceased had tested positive for the substance, in addition to fentanyl and other known chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, medetomidine is quickly becoming more common in Philadelphia’s street opioid supply than even &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-xylazine-a-medical-toxicologist-explains-how-it-increases-overdose-risk-and-why-narcan-can-still-save-a-life-199482"&gt;xylazine&lt;/a&gt;, a non-FDA-approved sedative linked to skin ulceration, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/xylazine-wounds-are-a-growing-crisis-among-drug-users-in-philly-a-nurse-explains-potential-causes-and-proper-treatment-230839"&gt;chronic wounds&lt;/a&gt; and amputation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xylazine was first &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00648.x"&gt;detected in Philadelphia street drugs in 2006&lt;/a&gt; and became increasingly common &lt;a href="https://hip.phila.gov/document/2524/PDPH-HAN_Alert_1_Xylazine_03.16.2022.pdf"&gt;starting in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. By early 2023, xylazine was detected in &lt;a href="https://www.cfsre.org/nps-discovery/drug-checking/drug-checking-quarterly-report-q1-and-q2-2023-philadelphia-pa-usa"&gt;98% of tested dope samples&lt;/a&gt; in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, its presence is steadily dropping, according to local drug-checking program data. The &lt;a href="https://hip.phila.gov/document/4874/PDPH-HAN-00444A-12-10-2024.pdf/"&gt;Philadelphia Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; says medetomidine has emerged as a primary adulterant and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/phillys-street-fentanyl-contains-an-industrial-chemical-called-btmps-thats-an-ingredient-in-plastic-249990"&gt;is now twice as common as xylazine&lt;/a&gt; in drug-checked samples. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies show even more unusual substances entering the street fentanyl supply, such as the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/phillys-street-fentanyl-contains-an-industrial-chemical-called-btmps-thats-an-ingredient-in-plastic-249990"&gt;industrial solvent BTMPS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, hospital and behavioral health providers are reporting more common presentations of severe withdrawal symptoms among people who use drugs in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Risks of medetomidine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While medetomidine’s sedating effects are similar in mechanism to xylazine, it is upward of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(88)90744-3"&gt;10-20 times more potent&lt;/a&gt;. It suppresses brain signals in the central nervous system, leading to deep sedation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since medetomidine is so powerful and does not act on opioid receptors, a person who overdoses on it often does not respond to the opioid-reversal drug naloxone, which goes by the brand name Narcan, in the manner we commonly expect from people who appear to have overdosed on opioids. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When patients overdose on a combination of opioids and medetomidine, providing naloxone will help individuals start breathing again but does not reverse the sedation caused by the medetomidine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our clinical experience, after patients start to breathe normally, providing additional doses of naloxone does not seem to help and even risks prompting opioid withdrawal symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, medetomidine presents serious clinical challenges for health care workers treating patients in withdrawal. These patients often experience symptoms such as rapid heart rate, severe spikes in blood pressure, restlessness, disorientation and confusion, and severe vomiting. While many of these symptoms were similar, if less intense, for those withdrawing from opioids and xylazine, the number of patients we are seeing is unprecedented – as is the severity of their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While published data on humans’ withdrawal from medetomidine is limited, clinicians are drawing comparisons to dexmedetomidine, a related drug used in humans that has shown &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/CCE.0000000000000035"&gt;similar features when withdrawn too quickly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers and clinicians in Philadelphia’s hospitals, including us at Thomas Jefferson University, are analyzing emerging clinical data. This data suggests that existing protocols that effectively controlled withdrawal symptoms in the era when xylazine was common are no longer adequate in the era of medetomidine. New protocols have been developed based on the guidance of local experts and are being tested.  &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Approaches to drug testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise in severe withdrawal symptoms has prompted expanded testing for adulterants such as medetomidine in Jefferson’s emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, drug testing involves two primary approaches. Qualitative analysis determines the presence or absence of substances. For example, fentanyl and xylazine test strips are commonly used by harm reduction groups and people who use drugs. Unfortunately, they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00478-4"&gt;can be unreliable&lt;/a&gt; and prone to user error, expiration, misinterpretation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dadr.2024.100241"&gt;false positives or negatives&lt;/a&gt;. This technology is also commonly used in urine drug-testing kits sold over the counter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantitative analysis, on the other hand, is a more sophisticated approach to drug testing. It uses complex technology such as &lt;a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/mass-spectrometry/mass-spectrometry-learning-center/liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry-lc-ms-information.html"&gt;liquid-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt; to separate the individual components of a sample and determine their concentration. This form of testing is more expensive and requires specialized equipment and analysts to perform the tests and interpret the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hospitals in the city have begun selectively testing urine and blood samples from patients who present with suspected medetomidine exposure. The labs are looking for the presence of certain drugs and their related byproducts, and also trying to identify distinct concentrations that might be associated with overdose, intoxication and withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implications for public health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe Philadelphians should be aware of these recent changes in the street drug supply and how people in their communities may react to exposure to medetomidine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naloxone is still recommended for a person showing signs of opioid overdose – such as excess sedation, shallow or absent breathing and small pupils. Narcan is &lt;a href="https://www.phila.gov/services/mental-physical-health/learn-how-to-get-and-use-naloxone-narcan/"&gt;freely available at pharmacies around the city&lt;/a&gt;. But if the patient starts breathing but does not immediately wake up, additional doses of naloxone should be avoided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, contact 911 for expert assistance and to get patients to an emergency department to complete their care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients who use large amounts of drugs may suffer from severe withdrawal symptoms. Typical medications given to those in opioid withdrawal, such as &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/philly-residents-with-opioid-addiction-get-medication-from-the-bupe-bus-creating-a-path-for-treatment-235167"&gt;buprenorphine&lt;/a&gt; or methadone, may not be sufficient to treat this constellation of symptoms. Even medications and regimens tailored for xylazine &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/philly-hospitals-test-new-strategy-for-tranq-dope-withdrawal-and-it-keeps-patients-from-walking-out-before-their-treatment-is-done-239915"&gt;may not be effective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients with severe withdrawal symptoms need to be seen in the emergency department, given the risk of undertreating this emerging condition. &lt;/p&gt;

One small &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024004614" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024004614" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="study" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.1.0"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that adults who ate chocolate high in cacao polyphenols performed better on a cognitive test than those who ate chocolate low in cacao polyphenols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="18" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Pistachios&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Pistachios have a high antioxidant capacity that rivals that of popular antioxidant-containing foods, and they are a plant-based source of complete protein,” explains Lauren Pincus, M.S., R.D.N., author of &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;The Protein-Packed Breakfast Club&lt;/em&gt;. “Foods that are high in antioxidants can be a powerful weapon against disease and premature aging of your body and your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="20" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Wild blueberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Eating “wild blueberries regularly may be an effective way to enhance some aspects of brain function and maintain others,” Pincus explains. “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768899/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768899/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Studies" data-node-id="21.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown wild blueberries can improve executive function, enhance memory, may slow down age-related cognitive decline, and improve metabolic health which benefits brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Leafy greens like spinach and kale offer major brain-healthy nutrients like “vitamin K, lutein, folate, and beta carotene,” Pincus says. In fact, she points to a &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000004815" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000004815" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="study" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that showed that around one serving a day of green leafy vegetables may help slow cognitive decline associated with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="24" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Various types of beans “contain folate, iron, magnesium, and antioxidants, which are all important to maintaining good brain health,” Pincus says. “Folate plays a role in neurodevelopment and cognitive function while iron helps with oxygen transport to the brain. Magnesium supports numerous biochemical reactions in the brain and helps with neurotransmitter regulation. Antioxidants like polyphenols help protect brain cells from oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="26" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Pumpkin seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Pumpkin seeds contain antioxidants that may protect the body and brain from free-radical damage. They’re also an excellent source of other nutrients important for brain health, including magnesium, zinc, iron, and copper,” says Simmons. Duffy Dillon also recommends seeds as a source of magnesium, which she says helps boost brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Simmons explains that eggs are a good source of nutrients tied to brain health, including vitamins B6 and B12, folate, and choline. Moon says egg yolks are packed with choline. “The brain needs choline to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that supports early brain development and lifelong memory maintenance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="30" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Green tea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28899506/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28899506/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Research" data-node-id="31.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="31.0.0"&gt;Research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that green tea may help with cognition. Simmons says, “Green tea contains caffeine, which may boost brain function and improve alertness, performance, memory, and focus,” she says. &lt;br data-node-id="31.2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="32" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Broccoli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Simmons points to broccoli as another brain-boosting food. “Broccoli also contains compounds such as sulforaphane that provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and may help protect the brain against damage. Sulforaphane levels are highly concentrated in broccoli sprouts,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="34" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Trout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ideal for those observing a pescatarian eating plan, or people simply looking to change up their menu, trout is a great brain food option. The fish is chock full of Omega-3s, which Duffy Dillon recommends adding to your menu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="36" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Corn tortillas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Corn tortillas contain lutein, which Moon says, “is a carotenoid with antioxidant benefits that also happens to make foods yellow or green, making them easy to spot in the produce department. “Lutein collects in the brain and eye area to protect them against oxidative stress,” she says. “We need this because the brain uses 20% of our oxygen, making it susceptible to oxidative stress.” Duffy Dillon also recommends corn tortillas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="38" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;High in Omega-3s, chia seeds are another great choice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589531/#Abs1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7589531/#Abs1" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Studies" data-node-id="39.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that chia seeds may aid in cognition. Enjoy them as a pudding by pairing them with healthy fats (like almond butter) and berries for a truly brain-boosting breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="40" class="body-h4 css-1u5xwlb emevuu60"&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Staying hydrated is key for brain health.  “Drink plenty of water, but you can eat your hydration by enjoying any fruit or vegetable that is crisp like cucumbers and bell peppers, or juicy like tomatoes or watermelon,” explains Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Add these delicious eats to your weekly rotation to aid in cognition and generally give your mind a boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="45" data-lazy-id="P0-15"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Foods to avoid for brain health" data-anchor-id="foods-to-avoid-for-brain-health" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emt9r7s1"&gt;Foods to avoid for brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, our experts recommend consuming the below in moderation, or steering clear if you’re inclined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="48" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But at the end of the day, fueling your body is what’s most important.

&lt;p&gt;It can be frustrating to see your child act on impulse and pay for it. Impulsivity is one reason people with unmanaged ADHD are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763421000567" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7850915" data-affiliate="true"&gt;more accident prone&lt;/a&gt; than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While instructing your child to think before acting may seem reasonable, said McClure, ADHD impulse control challenges are rooted in neurology. Kids with ADHD “often struggle to pause and reflect before acting, not because they don’t want to, but because their brain processes information differently,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than criticize your child for their brain-based differences, help them build skills in ways that feel natural and empowering, offered McClure. You could say, “I notice your brain wants to go fast right now. What would help slow things down?” or “It’s OK to get excited. Let’s figure out what will help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. “You signed up for this — you can’t quit.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids with ADHD are often deeply engaged when they’re interested in something. Such passionate attention, known as hyperfocus, can serve as a mighty &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X24000129" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7850915" data-affiliate="true"&gt;ADHD strength&lt;/a&gt;. When your child isn’t into an activity, however, their involvement can plummet to zero. And that’s OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Forcing an ADHD child to stick with an activity they no longer enjoy, one that doesn’t play to their strengths or one that has become overwhelming, can lead to discouragement and emotional dysregulation,” McClure said. Because ADHD brains thrive on engagement, autonomy and flexibility, she added, “rigid expectations can create stress, rather than resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than forcing your child to stay committed to something unappealing, McClure recommends supporting them in “making adjustments that foster self-awareness, emotional regulation, and the ability to advocate for their needs — skills they’ll need for life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. “Sit still.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Despite not being at the epicenter of the outbreak, the number of people being vaccinated has increased, according to Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We're 75 miles east of the actual outbreak, but we're seeing an increase in the number of vaccinations that we're giving in our community," she told ABC News. "Over the last four weeks, our health department has been operating a walk-in vaccine clinic that's just for MMR, and that vaccine clinic [has] administered a little over 300 vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She added that health officials have seen multiple babies under 6 months old who have been exposed to measles. Because they are too young to be vaccinated, they have been given shots of immunoglobulin, which are antibodies that act as a post-exposure prophylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Wells said the vaccines are available at no cost, and health officials have been trying to spread the word over social media and the local news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So we're kind of just getting the people that, I think, either their children are behind on vaccines, just because parents get busy and it's hard to get your four-year-old sometimes into the doctor's office, or people that were kind of on the fence about vaccines and maybe said, 'Well, I don't want to vaccinate my kids, because you never see measles.' But now that you're seeing measles, they're bringing their children in for vaccinations," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In conversations with colleagues in nearby health departments, such as in epicenter Gaines County, Wells has said it's been harder to reach residents to distribute the MMR vaccine, making the process somewhat of a "struggle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She explained that in Lubbock, the health department building is large -- with most residents knowing where it is -- and the department has more outreach staff than smaller departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think it's a little bit harder in some of these rural areas, because they're setting up in places that might not be as familiar to individuals," Wells said. "They're finding different locations in order to have those clinics; they're starting to focus a lot more on school-based clinics. So, let's go to where the children are and get the parents to come to that school and then offer the vaccine there, which I think is a great tactic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, in nearby New Mexico, the state Department of Health (NMDOH) &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 43 measles cases so far this year. Most of the cases have been confirmed in Lea County, which borders western Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Health officials suspect there may be a connection between the Texas and New Mexico cases, but a link has not yet been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Data from NMDOH provided to ABC News shows that between Feb. 1 and March 24 of this year, more than 13,100 MMR doses have been administered.

There [are] also still cases that are unreported or under-reported because people aren't seeking testing," she told ABC News.
