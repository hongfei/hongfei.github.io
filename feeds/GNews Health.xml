			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C_elegans_cell_and_nucleus_sizes.svg"&gt;J.J.Froehlich/CC BY-SA 4.0/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests showed that gene activity associated with caloric restriction could be seen in the kidney and liver tissues of mice treated with rilmenidine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, some of the changes that caloric restriction gives in animals and thought to confer certain health benefits also appear with a hypertension drug that many people already take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another discovery was that a biological signaling receptor called nish-1 was crucial in the effectiveness of rilmenidine. This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEwj7ICt3Y/"&gt;Prostock-studio/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes rilmenidine a promising candidate as an anti-aging drug is that it can be taken orally, it's already widely prescribed, and its side effects are rare and relatively mild (they include palpitations, insomnia, and drowsiness in a few cases).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a long way to go yet in figuring out if rilmenidine would work as an anti-aging drug for actual humans, but the early signs in these worm and mice tests are promising. We now know much more about what rilmenidine can do, and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging, even if slightly, are immense," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2023.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It refers to the fat stored deep within your abdominal cavity, surrounding essential organs like the liver, pancreas and intestines. And when it comes to visceral fat, it’s not about appearance; reducing it is truly about protecting your well-being. That’s where your diet comes into play. Some foods may make a huge difference when it comes to managing visceral fat and supporting overall health. Among the many nutritional powerhouses out there, one protein-rich food stands out for its unique benefits—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pistachios&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike the fat just beneath your skin, visceral fat isn’t visible, making it tricky to detect. And not because you can’t see it means it doesn’t affect you. In fact, this type of fat can significantly impact your health. Excess visceral fat has been linked to a higher risk of several serious health conditions, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and even certain types of cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data supports the notion that eating pistachios might be linked to reduced visceral fat. One study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; showed that when people with at least one risk factor for metabolic syndrome snacked on tree nuts (like pistachios) instead of typical carbohydrate-heavy snacks (like chips or cookies) for 16 weeks, improvements in measures of visceral fat were observed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what makes them one of the best choices for reducing visceral fat?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Let’s be clear—no single food will reduce visceral fat, especially if you are not making appropriate overall dietary and lifestyle changes that support this outcome. But if you are taking steps to minimize this dangerous type of abdominal fat, including pistachios in the mix may help you see the results you want to see. Here are four reasons why dietitians recommend pistachios as a top pick for a visceral fat-reducing diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Pistachios are one of the best foods for reducing visceral fat, partly thanks to their rich content of healthy fats. “Pistachios are a good source of healthy fat, namely unsaturated fatty acids, which are considered cardioprotective. Saturated fats, on the other hand, are implicated in increasing the risk of cardiovascular problems and potentially additional visceral fat buildup,” shares &lt;a href="https://www.amandagodmannutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amanda Godman, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in pistachios play a crucial role in combating unhealthy fat accumulation. Monounsaturated fats, for instance, help improve lipid profiles by lowering LDL (known as “bad”) cholesterol while increasing HDL (known as “good”) cholesterol levels. This enhances overall cardiovascular health, which is closely linked to maintaining a healthy body weight and reducing abdominal fat. Additionally, these fats help regulate insulin sensitivity, a key factor in preventing visceral fat storage, as unchecked insulin resistance can lead to fat buildup around the abdomen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Data shows that consuming monounsaturated fat instead of saturated fat is linked to not only a reduction in body fat but also a difference in where fat is stored. In a 2022 study, when people ate a diet rich in saturated fat, most of the fat they gained was deposited in the abdomen as visceral fat. Those who followed a monounsaturated fat-rich diet lost weight and did not accumulate fat as visceral fat in the same way.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A single ounce of pistachios provides roughly 6 grams of protein, making them one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/nuts-and-seeds-ranked-by-protein-8423784" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein-rich nuts&lt;/a&gt;. Protein plays a role in fat loss as it boosts energy expenditure through the thermic effect of food (TEF), meaning your body burns more calories digesting and metabolizing protein than fats or carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, consuming high-protein foods like pistachios helps preserve lean muscle mass during weight loss, ensuring that the body prioritizes burning visceral fat rather than muscle tissue.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Gerontology&lt;/em&gt; showed that, among older men, consuming more protein may be linked to decreased visceral abdominal fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Antioxidants play a role in combating oxidative stress and inflammation, which are both linked to visceral fat accumulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Among the powerful antioxidants in pistachios are lutein, beta-carotene and polyphenols. These compounds help neutralize free radicals in the body, reducing cellular damage and promoting overall metabolic health. Studies have shown that diets rich in antioxidants can support better fat metabolism and improve insulin sensitivity, both of which are essential for minimizing visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you have your plump, firm, unwilted, and vibrant asparagus washed and ready to go, let’s study up on some of the most common stalk mistakes so you can steer clear of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the chefs we spoke with, try to avoid the following common faux pas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Letting it get parched.&lt;/strong&gt; For maximum flavor and the best texture, it’s ideal to cook your asparagus as soon as possible after you pick it from the garden or the supermarket. If you plan to cook it later, don’t &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-store-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;store&lt;/a&gt; it dry. Instead, keep it like you would with flowers. Trim the ends and place the asparagus, spears up, in a jar that has about half an inch of water. Cover loosely with a plastic bag, and change the water daily. Alternatively, wrap the trimmed ends in a damp paper towel, tuck the asparagus in a plastic bag, and store them in your refrigerator’s &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/what-is-a-crisper-drawer/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;crisper drawer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipping the trim.&lt;/strong&gt; The most common mistake home cooks make related to asparagus is forgetting to trim the stems, says Chef Mary Payne Moran of Los Angeles. The stem can be extremely tough, woody, and not very tasty, adds cookbook author Yumna Jawad of Grand Rapids. Plan on cutting off about 1 to 2 inches from the bottom of the spears or at the point where stalks change from green to pale green or white. If the stalks are extremely thick at the ends, consider using a vegetable peeler to shave off the outermost layer or two, says Chef Adam Fiscus of New York City. Save any trimmed pieces for &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-vegetable-stock-out-of-kitchen-scraps/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;vegetable stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking low and slow.&lt;/strong&gt; Asparagus can handle the heat, Jawad confirms. Don’t be afraid to crank things up to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) when roasting or grilling, or even 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) if you like charred edges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepping it wet.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re cooking asparagus in any other way besides steaming or blanching, it's crucial to dry the asparagus well after washing. “If it has too much moisture on it, it will likely steam instead of cooking as you intended, so make sure to pat it dry well to get the best texture,” Jawad explains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Should you &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/49439/the-best-steamed-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;steam in the microwave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/266394/air-fryer-asparagus-fries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;air-fry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223427/parmesan-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;bake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214931/oven-roasted-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;roast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18318/pan-fried-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;pan-fry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/220715/deep-fried-asparagus/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="7"&gt;deep-fry&lt;/a&gt;, or try another technique? We polled the pros, and one method blew the competition out of the water. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If they were forced to choose just one way to ensure asparagus doesn't become soggy, the chefs recommend &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/how-to-make-best-roasted-asparagus-8621524" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;roasting&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though asparagus is a vegetable, it contains some natural sugars, which caramelize when roasted, Jawad notes. This lends nuttiness and slightly sweeter flavor, plus each stalk can cook evenly—and with very little fuss. If you allow enough space between the stalks, “there is no watery residue, and the bite is crunchy with a hint of chew,” Moran explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Roasting deepens the flavor so the tips get a bit crispy, plus it’s also easy,” says cookbook author Peter Som of New York City.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Toss washed and trimmed asparagus with 1 tablespoon oil per pound, season with salt and black pepper, then evenly space out the stalks in a single layer on a parchment paper-lined sheet pan. Moran suggests avoiding pans that are very dark in color, as this can lead to uneven cooking. Roast for 10 to 12 minutes, or until slightly golden brown and the thickest part of the asparagus is fork-tender.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grilling, blanching, and steaming in the microwave all deserve honorable mentions and will certainly satisfy depending on your goals and personal preferences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Grilling &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For results similar to roasting but achievable al fresco, Fiscus is fond of grilling. “Asparagus cooked this way looks great and tastes amazing, adding elegance to any plated protein dish,” he explains. It’s also versatile. As a tip, Fiscus likes to &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19620/easy-and-tasty-all-purpose-marinade/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;marinate&lt;/a&gt; his vegetables for 30 minutes to a few hours to infuse each bite with extra flavor. Still, grilling didn’t get quite as many upvotes because it requires more gear and optimal weather…or a really warm coat and some thick skin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heat your grill to high, or around 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Toss washed and trimmed asparagus with 1 tablespoon oil or vinaigrette per pound, season with salt and black pepper, then add the asparagus in a single layer on the grill grates. Cook, turning often with tongs, until lightly charred and fork-tender (about 3 to 5 minutes).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Blanching &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It might be a bit ho-hum to enjoy on its own as a side dish. However, if you plan to put your cooked asparagus to use in salads or crudité platters, blanching is a brilliant option, Som says. “You’ll get the bright green color with that tender crisp texture,” he explains, which pairs perfectly with a &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/8391899/apple-cider-vinaigrette/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bright vinaigrette&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/286167/instant-pot-jammy-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;jammy egg&lt;/a&gt;, or your favorite &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/most-saved-dip-recipe-8775965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dip recipe&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To blanch asparagus, bring a pot of water to a boil. Add washed and trimmed asparagus stalks to the water and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, erring on the longer side for thicker asparagus. Once the color appears even more vibrant, use tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the blanched asparagus to a bowl of ice water. Chill for 2 minutes, then remove, pat dry, and enjoy as desired.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block allrecipes-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Steaming in the Microwave &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Director of Culinary Matt Larkin of New York City admits, “My secret asparagus tip is to microwave it.” True, it might sound like a humble shortcut, but steaming gives the spears a crisp-tender quality similar to blanching—but without waiting for a pot of water to boil and preparing an ice bath. It leaps and bounds above boiling, according to Moran, since you don’t end up with the wet residue that tends to occur post-boil. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Wash and trim the asparagus, then place it in a single layer on a plate. Cover the stalks with a damp paper towel, then microwave for about 3 minutes, or until the center is tender when you pierce it with a knife.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all these methods, you're now equipped for a season full of delicious asparagus.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						A positive case of measles was confirmed in a Howard County resident who recently traveled internationally, according to health officials.The Maryland Department of health said this case is not associated with a measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico.Out of an abundance of caution, health officials are trying to identify people who might have been exposed.

Usually, one to four days after the early symptoms, a red rash appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Measles symptoms typically develop 10-14 days after exposure to the virus but can develop as soon as seven days and as long as 21 days after exposure. A person with measles is contagious, beginning four days before the rash appears until four days after the rash begins.MDH said people are generally considered immune to measles if they have had two measles vaccine shots, previously had measles or laboratory evidence of immunity or infection, or were born in the United States before 1957.Those who are most at risk of complications from measles infection are pregnant women, infants less than 1 year old, and those who are immune compromised. People in these at risk groups who may have potentially been exposed and are not immune should contact their health care provider or call Howard County Health Department's Infectious Disease Surveillance and Response Program at 410-313-6284 for additional guidance. Virginia residents with additional questions about their potential exposure can call the Virginia Department Health at 804-363-2704 or email epi_response@vdh.virginia.gov.People, especially those not vaccinated or otherwise immune to measles, who were at any of these locations during the possible exposure times should monitor themselves for any early symptoms of measles for 21 days after the potential exposure. People who develop a fever or other symptoms of measles should not go to childcare, school, work, or out in public, and should contact their health care provider. They should call their health care provider first rather than showing up in the waiting room or emergency room so that the office can take measures to prevent spread to other patients.Measles cases do occur sporadically in Maryland with one case of measles identified in Maryland in 2024, one in 2023, and no cases from 2020-2022.This report will be updated.

"It was a dark moment. I have lost many friends from different types of cancers, and so my first thought was, 'I'm done.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinley had 15 inches of her colon removed. She then met with Dr. Mark Lewis, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Intermountain Health, and told him she was concerned about the side effects of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, she was eligible for another type of treatment: immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of patients, understandably, when you tell them they require chemotherapy, will refuse it, so it is incredibly appealing to patients that we now have another option to treat cancer, and that's immunotherapy," Lewis said. "The entire point is to turn on the immune system and allow the patient's own body to destroy the cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is a candidate for immunotherapy, and Lewis noted with this kind of treatment, there is a risk of developing an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not going to pretend that these treatments have absolutely no side effects, but for the most part, these treatments are far more tolerable than chemotherapy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinley went in for an IV every three weeks for two years. She experienced nausea at first but said she had no other side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was very successful, and I'm in remission," she said. "I feel great. I feel really good. Strong and healthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her cancer journey hasn't been easy, but she has remained positive, focusing on her family and her religion. She's now encouraging others to make their health a priority, especially since she didn't experience any signs or symptoms before being diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Eva Brinley rings a bell signifying she has finished her cancer treatment. (Photo: Eva Brinley)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just can't stress enough how important it is to do those checkups," she said. "Stay healthy. Eat right. Have your checkups, and be aware."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer. While some people may not have any symptoms, like Eva, warning signs of colon cancer may include persistent or progressive abdominal pain, changes in bowel movements, such as constipation or diarrhea, blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend people at average risk of colon cancer begin screening at age 45.

After all, recent studies show that major shifts like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39797935/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:switching to a Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;switching to a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.26804" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:engaging in regular brain training to improve memory and attention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;engaging in regular brain training to improve memory and attention&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11047847/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slashing stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slashing stress&lt;/a&gt; are all excellent ways to boost cognitive health. In addition to these great options, &lt;strong&gt;there's another simple trick to protect your brain: move your body for just five minutes a day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;strong&gt;as little as 35 minutes total of exercise per week can reduce the chance of dementia over a subsequent four-year timespan by an amazing 41%.&lt;/strong&gt; Even people who aren’t used to any physical exertion at all can gain this benefit with a small amount of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, the researchers found that the more exercise you do, the more your dementia risk drops. For example, out of the 90,000 adults from the United Kingdom who participated in the study, those who did 25 to 60 minutes of exercise a week saw a 60% reduction in risk. The participants who did 70 to 130.9 minutes of exercise a week achieved a 63% lower risk and those who did 140 minutes or more of exercise in seven days accomplished a 69% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course, doing more is better, but the point of the study was to show that any extra movement counts,” says the study's lead author &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3809/amal-asiri-wanigatunga" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amal Wanigatunga, PhD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amal Wanigatunga, PhD, MPH,&lt;/a&gt; assistant professor of epidemiology in the Bloomberg School’s department of epidemiology with a joint appointment at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and core faculty member at the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, nearly 7 million adults in the US have dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures#:~:text=An%20estimated%206.9%20million%20Americans,prevent%20or%20cure%20Alzheimer's%20disease." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Alzheimer’s Association reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the Alzheimer’s Association reports&lt;/a&gt;.

Exercise also &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2025.1502417/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improves blood flow to the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improves blood flow to the brain&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, “there is other published evidence showing that exercise is associated with &lt;a href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain-physiology/what-neurogenesis#:~:text=Neurogenesis%20is%20the%20process%20by,birth%20and%20throughout%20our%20lifespan." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurogenesis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt; and increased brain volume,” says Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What kind of activity works to cut your dementia risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: whatever activity you enjoy that raises your heart rate will do the trick. “Our findings suggest anything counts!” says Wanigatunga. “The way we measured moderate to vigorous physical activity was through a wrist-worn electronic monitor that captures all activity types — not just structured exercise. Therefore, the results suggest &lt;strong&gt;any extra movement – which can also include structured exercise – beyond one's usual daily routine that is at a moderate intensity or higher could be beneficial to reduce dementia risk.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means you can fit in your daily movement in short bursts – taking the stairs instead of the elevator, briskly walking the dog, you name it. In the most recent &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (published in 2018), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week — an average of a little more than 20 minutes a day. However, this can be tough for some people to manage. “The point of the study was to show any extra movement counts,” assures Wanigatunga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How else can physical activity benefit your brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise can help you think better, remember more, have an easier time solving problems and achieve emotional balance, which can help with depression and anxiety, according to information &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity/features/boost-brain-health.html#:~:text=Physical%20activity%20can%20help%20you,of%20cognitive%20decline%2C%20including%20dementia." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published by the CDC on January 31, 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;published by the CDC on January 31, 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, physical activity also improves the brain functions that affect your hearing. “The brain does not just receive sound; it actively interprets and organizes it, allowing us to focus on conversations, filter out background noise and make sense of complex sounds,” says &lt;a href="https://spauldingrehab.org/physician/1052/daniel-daneshvar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daniel Daneshvar, MD, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daniel Daneshvar, MD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, co-chair of sports concussion at &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mass General Brigham;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; and chief of the division of brain injury at &lt;a href="https://spauldingrehab.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Spaulding Rehabilitation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Spaulding Rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt; in Boston and assistant professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is pretty significant, because if you develop hearing trouble between the ages of 40 and 65, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2023/new-study-links-hearing-loss-with-dementia-in-older-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; your dementia risk increases. “As we age, changes in brain health can make it harder to process what we hear, even if our ears are still working well,” explains Dr. Daneshvar. &lt;strong&gt;“Regular exercise supports brain function by improving blood flow, strengthening neural connections and reducing inflammation, all of which help maintain cognitive abilities.&lt;/strong&gt; This means that staying physically active may not only protect hearing, but also help preserve the ability to understand speech in noisy environments, react quickly to sounds, and stay engaged in conversations, which are all important for long-term cognitive and social well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working more physical activity in your life can pay off for your brain now and later. “Move as much as possible throughout the day, and add regular exercise sessions for even stronger protection,” Dr. Danesgvar suggests. &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anatomy-of-the-brain" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Your brain isn’t a muscle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Your brain isn’t a muscle&lt;/a&gt;

of our food supply in America. But these foods have been &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:linked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to serious health problems, from type 2 diabetes to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20065762/obesity-metabolic-syndrome-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a61766184/vegan-diet-may-reduce-biological-age-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:faster biological aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;faster biological aging&lt;/a&gt;, so it might be smart to start reassessing your relationship with some of these products. Plus, cutting back on your ultra-processed food intake could help some folks reach a healthier weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scaling back on all-things ultra-processed is easier said than done, a new scientific study just found that there's actually a pretty simple trick that can help you avoid these foods that works in just eight weeks. Doctors are calling the intervention “effective” and “smart.” Here’s what it involves, plus why it’s worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tony Yang,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tony Yang,&lt;/a&gt; DSc, MPH, professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health in the Department of Health Policy and Management and associate dean for Health Policy and Population Science at George Washington University; &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, weight loss surgeon, nutrition expert, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/osp4.70029" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Obesity Science and Practice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Obesity Science and Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, followed 14 adults with obesity or overweight who usually ate at least two ultra-processed foods a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had participants follow an eight-week plan that involved weekly educational group sessions and individual meal planning sessions. Those sessions also included information on how to identify ultra-processed foods, why they can be harmful, and strategies for dealing with cravings (which can sometimes occur when cutting back on ultra-processed foods). The participants received financial support in the form of a $100 grocery store gift card, too—all with the goal of helping them identify ultra-processed foods and consume less of them in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had participants complete questionnaires on their diets at the start of the study and again at the end, and they found that participants reduced their ultra-processed foods intake by nearly half. This also led to a reduction in caloric intake from these foods by nearly 49 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, the participants consumed 612 less calories a day, 37 percent less sodium, and 50 percent less sugar. (They didn’t make any big changes to how much fruits or vegetables they ate.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big stat to keep in mind: The participants lost an average of 7.7 pounds during the eight-week trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was the program so successful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have a few theories. Instead of just telling people to "eat healthier," this educational method "provides structured support to navigate a food environment where ultra-processed foods dominate,” says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tony Yang,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tony Yang,&lt;/a&gt; DSc, MPH, professor in the Milken Institute School of Public Health in the Department of Health Policy and Management and associate dean for Health Policy and Population Science at George Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mix of education, personalized meal planning, financial assistance, and advice on coping with cravings is a solid combination, Yang says. “In essence, when individuals are equipped with knowledge, practical tools, and support, they are more likely to make sustainable dietary changes,” he says. “It turns out that when ultra-processed foods stop competing for attention, nutrient-dense foods can take center stage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the weight-loss front, ultra-processed foods tend to be high in calories and are really tasty, making them tough to resist, says &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, weight loss surgeon, nutrition expert, and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. “They encourage overeating and weight gain,” she adds. As a result, it just makes sense that people would lose weight when they cut back on how much of these foods they have, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can I apply these findings to my own life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, educating yourself about processed foods doesn't always require spending boatloads of cash. Just make sure you stick to vetted sources that rely on trained medical experts. &lt;em&gt;Women's Health &lt;/em&gt;also has its own &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods guide;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods guide&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down the big points, if you're looking for a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to drill down a little more, researchers from Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital just released a website called &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.truefood.tech/__;!!Ivohdkk!nft9loFpT2vkoAso3_kZS0uwva7vdEqWGRic1LHaEPWgvVlKKy1g9622R42IWpY7U9hGp7K0U4zW7qKQYtWESQ$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TrueFood;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TrueFood&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to search for the level of processing involved in products sold at popular grocery chains. If you're still having a tough time weeding out ultra-processed foods from their less-processed counterparts, it might be worth having a chat with a registered dietitian, if your budget allows for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes food ultra-processed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All foods are classified by something called the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224421004970" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NOVA scale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NOVA scale&lt;/a&gt;, which puts foods into four different categories that denote different levels of processing based on certain features. Here’s a breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unprocessed and minimally processed foods &lt;/strong&gt;are in their natural state or are barely altered. That includes foods like fresh produce and milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; are products made through minimal processing, including pressing, grinding, refining, or milling. Olive oil and almond flour fall into this camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; are changed from their natural state. They usually have things like sugar, oil, salt, or other ingredients added. Bagged frozen vegetables and canned fish fall are considered processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; are processed, with additional ingredients like artificial colors, flavors, additives, and preservatives to add texture and extend the products’ shelf life. These foods are usually packaged, and include things like potato chips, sweetened cereals, and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tricky to know at first glance which foods are ultra-processed and which aren't. But often, these foods come in a package (instead of say, sitting in the fresh air in the produce aisle). Beyond that, some of the biggest ultra-processed foods include things like sausages, deli meats, salty snacks, packaged cookies, and sodas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is ultra-processed food bad for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot of media coverage of the harms of consuming a ton of ultra-processed foods lately. Dr. Kim points out that they have been “linked to serious health risks.” Those &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:include;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, you should also know that these foods are generally not very nutritious and contain higher levels of simple carbohydrates and sugars, says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali,&lt;/a&gt; MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. That can crowd out more nutritious foods and raise the risk of weight gain, he says. “Carbohydrates and sugars are what we advise that our patients &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; to help them lose weight,” Dr. Ali adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much ultra-processed food is safe to consume?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no scientifically established consumption limit for these foods at the moment, Yang says. But “research consistently suggests that limiting ultra-processed food intake is beneficial for overall health,” he adds. Said another way: Less is best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why Dr. Kim recommends focusing on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and nuts, over ultra-processed foods. Dr. Ali also suggests trying to fill your plate with protein sources and vegetables first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all ultra-processed foods are bad for you. Take, unsweetened almond milk. It's an ultra-processed food, but Dr. Ali says it can be a good cow’s milk substitute for people who are sensitive to dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Yang just recommends doing your best to learn more about ultra-processed foods, and limit how much of them you have. “A reasonable goal would be to shift toward a diet where whole or minimally-processed foods are the foundation, with ultra-processed foods as the occasional indulgence rather than a dietary staple,” he says. “Much like screen time or dessert, moderation is key.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 16:01:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9kTGJHdVdXX0tpOTZaYTQ0WWVORmJGVFFaSUlRblJQektTcktKdW1YNU5vZzNpRHhVbGlrdnJMTVpKXzRJMkxQcjlBUGtDMi1MWW9hTGhSVDVsY3M4Sk5Oc1B2WHMydEtqWkpIS2haRUJ6Zw</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Have Discovered Shocking Amounts of Microplastics in the Brain – And It Could Be Increasing Our Risk of Dementia - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMzBvTkV2XzFoYkNaUUVRUW5yNkVIUUhPUXFES0hJemN6YmxPcThvYnZaY2tnbXhGR0tmcWZfTjFLdDVpVWtFenBoN2Zfd09IV2g5V1htdEFsOElaZkpfNjlTT0tUekRVQ2pqMm42d0dDdUFWamhjdzdDTjRqWHhIODdJbmtKbkhoOGloenlnTGZkUTZ0NUhzYzJFU3hma3VVTlA3TldmSkkwXzZVbU02c2JRZWxFck9PWlNoY04yeVVXMzcwVFltckk3ZjhDSm5YeHAySHpjRHBVREU0aFo4SA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 15:17:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4AFBVV95cUxQMzBvTkV2XzFoYkNaUUVRUW5yNkVIUUhPUXFES0hJemN6YmxPcThvYnZaY2tnbXhGR0tmcWZfTjFLdDVpVWtFenBoN2Zfd09IV2g5V1htdEFsOElaZkpfNjlTT0tUekRVQ2pqMm42d0dDdUFWamhjdzdDTjRqWHhIODdJbmtKbkhoOGloenlnTGZkUTZ0NUhzYzJFU3hma3VVTlA3TldmSkkwXzZVbU02c2JRZWxFck9PWlNoY04yeVVXMzcwVFltckk3ZjhDSm5YeHAySHpjRHBVREU0aFo4SA</guid></item><item><title>Microplastics in the brain: Alarming new details revealed - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxORjE1Qy0wTjladmJxQjZ5NmJlQUtyYkUxQWpwSkI1SVRzYlJscHZOWWxIdEpQZ0I1RjZMaDIxNkVLb1dIR3BoZ0ZiRkIzbkQzRU05cDV5bWcta191VDF1Sk9aVG0xY1poelYtLWlrbFpfRkVYT19mTmhYRXhtNjJfZHZ3MmJSVlhIanFaYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics in the environment have become a well-known issue, sparking global concern. More recently, however, research has revealed that microplastics infiltrate human bodies, particularly the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As studies reveal new details about the accumulation of plastic particles in our bodies, scientists are delving deeper into their potential impacts and ways to prevent exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39901044/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that our brains house around a spoonful of these tiny plastic fragments, which is alarming, to say the least. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed the brains of deceased people who had been diagnosed with dementia, their levels of microplastics were 3-5 times higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to these and other relevant findings, researchers from the &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; and the University of Toronto published a review of the current state of knowledge on the accumulation of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/micro-nanoplastics-mnps-help-cancer-cells-spread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;micro and nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; (MNPs) in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-in-the-brain"&gt;Microplastics in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that microplastics are pervasive in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming. This rise mirrors the exponential increase we’re seeing in environmental microplastic levels,&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt; said Dr. Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that concentrations of MNPs were 7-30 times higher in brain tissue than in other vital organs, such as the liver or kidneys. It seems that our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-brains-are-constantly-working-to-predict-what-comes-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt; are favored by these miniscule shards of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly less than 200 nanometers in length and primarily composed of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/disposable-coffee-cups-release-trillions-of-plastic-particles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyethylene&lt;/a&gt;, these tiny invaders were found in the cerebrovascular walls and immune cells of the brain. The particles are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to speculations about their role in neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not certain whether patients with dementia had high levels of MNPs due to the neurological condition, or whether the particles promoted the development of dementia. Future studies will investigate this relationship further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tackling-the-microplastic-menace"&gt;Tackling the microplastic menace&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving beyond the danger they pose, the research highlights useful practices that we can employ in our daily lives to reduce MNP exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An action as simple as opting for filtered tap water instead of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hundreds-of-thousands-of-nanoplastics-found-in-bottled-water/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bottled water&lt;/a&gt; could lower microplastic intake from a staggering 90,000 to 4,000 particles per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined. Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90%, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake,” said Dr. Brandon Luu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other significant sources of MNPs include plastic seals in tea bags, which could release millions of tiny particles per brewing session, noted Dr. Luu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heating food in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plastic-containers-may-release-forever-chemicals-into-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic containers&lt;/a&gt; – especially in the microwave – can release substantial amounts of microplastics. Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-elimination-pathways"&gt;Possible elimination pathways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also reported on studies about potential elimination pathways. For instance, sweating may aid in the removal of certain plastic-derived compounds from the body. However, the researchers caution that more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more research to wrap our heads around microplastics – rather than wrapping our brains in them – since this could be one of the biggest environmental storms most people never saw coming,&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt; said Dr. David Puder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary emphasizes the need for research priorities, including establishing clear exposure limits and evaluating long-term health repercussions of microplastic bioaccumulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also an urgent need for extensive human studies to uncover relationships between microplastic exposure and chronic health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-and-neurological-health"&gt;Microplastics and neurological health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As researchers continue to uncover the extent of microplastic accumulation in the human brain, concerns are mounting about its potential impact on neurological health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these particles in cerebrovascular walls and immune cells in the brain suggests they may contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation in the brain has been associated with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other cognitive impairments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of microplastics in individuals with dementia raise concerns about their role in accelerating neuroinflammation and neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these particles interact with brain cells, disrupt neural pathways, and influence cognitive decline is essential for assessing long-term health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full review article was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 14:30:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxORjE1Qy0wTjladmJxQjZ5NmJlQUtyYkUxQWpwSkI1SVRzYlJscHZOWWxIdEpQZ0I1RjZMaDIxNkVLb1dIR3BoZ0ZiRkIzbkQzRU05cDV5bWcta191VDF1Sk9aVG0xY1poelYtLWlrbFpfRkVYT19mTmhYRXhtNjJfZHZ3MmJSVlhIanFaYw</guid></item><item><title>Getting more of some vitamins during pregnancy may lower future risk of high blood pressure - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxNR3UxTmZQNUctb2Rib1Z3U0tUZlZSNXE4TVZwSlVMRGlYVUFaRm5sMEtwM2tneE1oRTJJZXNKTzdOUjktZVo0d19CQ3lBbE1UeUlnNFgweC1sN250X0NVSUx4WlgtVDRHUzFIcEJRTUQ4M3dGNGdXYUszcHVTVUJwaWNPMFotOVlCTHNwdDdHQnRLeGtaQ29iTUVrUTRJYVduakVPUzBXVjY2SkhZOEVYSEF5RjJQcFpLbkJrN3RLWGVIclFZS1Fj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Pregnant women whose blood contains higher levels of essential vitamins and minerals – such as B12, copper and manganese – may face a lower risk for high blood pressure two decades later, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published Thursday in the journal Hypertension, also will be presented Saturday at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology and Prevention/Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health Scientific Sessions in New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manganese, selenium, magnesium and copper are essential metals whose anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory properties have been shown to help protect against cardiovascular disease. Prior research has linked higher levels of manganese to a lower risk for preeclampsia, or high blood pressure during pregnancy. In the new study, researchers wanted to learn if higher levels of these metals circulating in a woman's blood during pregnancy might influence the risk of developing high blood pressure later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are constantly exposed to heavy metals and trace elements, and much research has shown that exposure to those metals and elements may have an impact on cardiovascular health, especially hypertension," lead study author Dr. Mingyu Zhang said in a news release. Zhang is an epidemiologist and instructor in medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang and his colleagues analyzed data for 493 women enrolled in Project Viva, an ongoing study of women and children in eastern Massachusetts that launched in 1999. Using blood samples collected between 1999 and 2002 during the early stages of the women's pregnancies, the researchers measured concentrations of nonessential metals, including arsenic, barium, cadmium, cesium, mercury and lead, and essential metals, including copper, magnesium, manganese, selenium and zinc. They also measured folate and vitamin B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 20 years later, between 2017 and 2021, the researchers measured blood pressure for the participants, who were then an average of 51 years old. Participants were considered to have high blood pressure if their measurements were 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above, or if they reported taking medication to control their blood pressure. According to the AHA and American College of Cardiology, blood pressure is considered normal if the systolic reading (the top number) is below 120 mmHg and the diastolic (the bottom number) is under 80 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women whose blood levels of copper doubled during pregnancy, the risk of having high blood pressure in midlife was 25% lower. A doubling of manganese during pregnancy resulted in a 20% lower risk. When looking at the combination of copper, manganese, selenium and zinc, the higher the levels found during pregnancy, the lower the risk for high blood pressure in midlife. There was no link between nonessential metals and blood pressure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy were also associated with a lower midlife risk for high blood pressure. Women with double the amount of B12 during pregnancy had systolic blood pressure measurements that were an average 3.64 mmHg lower and diastolic measurements an average 2.52 mmHg lower than their peers with lower levels of B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because researchers did not analyze where the women were getting their vitamins and minerals, such as foods or dietary supplements, they cautioned that their findings should not be interpreted as recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Zhang said, "optimizing these essential metals, minerals and vitamins, particularly copper, manganese and vitamin B12, during pregnancy may offer protective benefits against hypertension in midlife, an especially critical time period for women's future cardiovascular risk in later life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research, including clinical trials, he said, is needed to determine the optimal dietary intake of these minerals and micronutrients. The researchers hope to ultimately identify women at high risk for developing high blood pressure later in life and intervene during pregnancy, either with enhanced nutrition or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Heart Association News covers heart and brain health.

Additionally, this research is still in its early stages, and it is not yet clear which cancer patients might benefit from taking the drug. The study, recently published in the journal Nature, examined how the immune system responds to cancer metastasis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="ec41n-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ec41n-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ec41n-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;It found that platelets, which are responsible for blood clotting, interfere with T cells’ ability to destroy cancer cells. Researchers discovered that aspirin, which inhibits platelet activity, helps the immune system detect and eliminate cancer cells before they form metastases. This discovery was made by chance. The Cambridge research team was not initially studying aspirin but rather how the immune system responds to cancer spread. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="9qofg-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="9qofg-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="9qofg-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Using genetically engineered mice, they found that animals lacking certain genetic instructions were at a lower risk of developing metastases. Further investigation into the body’s processes revealed that T-cells were affected in a manner similar to the known effects of aspirin. This unexpected finding redirected the researchers’ focus entirely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="1t02g-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1t02g-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1t02g-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Although the findings are primarily based on animal experiments, they provide important insights that could eventually lead to human clinical trials and improvements in current treatment options. Professor Gil Bar-Sela, director of the Beit Shulamit Cancer Center at the Emek Medical Center in northern Israel, commented on the clinical implications of the new research on aspirin and cancer treatment. "It is still too early to determine the clinical significance of these findings," he said. "The big question is whether and how this will translate into a tangible impact on cancer treatment." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="6jkvl-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6jkvl-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6jkvl-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"The immune system is complex and influenced by many factors, so additional research is needed to understand the full implications," he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="74uj7-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.Hkg9EPlisye" id="image_ArticleImageData.Hkg9EPlisye"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.Hkg9EPlisye" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/SJyPI7vske/SJyPI7vske_0_0_1000_660_0_x-large.jpg" alt="טסיות דם. אילוסטרציה תלת-ממדית" title="Blood platelets  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.Hkg9EPlisye" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/SJyPI7vske/SJyPI7vske_0_0_1000_660_0_x-large.jpg" alt="טסיות דם. אילוסטרציה תלת-ממדית" title="Blood platelets  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Blood platelets &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="bcj5l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bcj5l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bcj5l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; Unlike new drugs that require years of development, aspirin is an established and widely used medication. This makes it relatively easy to study its effects on cancer patients, particularly those undergoing immunotherapy — a treatment that activates the immune system against cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="citph-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="citph-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="citph-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Aspirin may serve as a complementary treatment that enhances the effectiveness of immunotherapy, much like other attempts to combine drugs, viruses, or vaccines that stimulate the immune system," Bar-Sela explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="csdtt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="csdtt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="csdtt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He noted that a significant advantage is the ability to investigate aspirin’s potential using existing extensive data sets in Israel and globally. A comparison between cancer patients taking aspirin for unrelated reasons and those who do not could provide initial clues about its effectiveness as a complementary treatment. While this is a promising area of research, additional clinical trials are needed before definitive recommendations can be made. Over a decade ago, intriguing data suggested that people who took daily aspirin had a higher chance of survival following a cancer diagnosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="7bhll-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7bhll-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7bhll-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The key to this lies in the moment when a single cancer cell detaches from the primary tumor and attempts to spread through the body — a process known as metastasis, which is responsible for most cancer-related deaths. At this point, the immune system — particularly T cells, a type of white blood cell — can destroy the cancer cell before it establishes itself in a new location. However, researchers found that platelets, the blood cells responsible for clotting, interfere with T-cell activity, preventing them from destroying cancer cells. Aspirin works by inhibiting platelets, thereby removing the obstacle to T-cell function and enabling them to detect and eliminate cancer cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="3sqh2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="3sqh2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="3sqh2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;According to the researchers, using aspirin could be most effective for patients diagnosed early, following treatments such as surgery, to help the immune system eliminate remaining cancer cells. However, they emphasize that cancer patients should not rush to purchase aspirin on their own, as much more research is needed in this area. Currently, certain patients with Lynch syndrome — a genetic mutation that increases cancer risk — already take aspirin as part of their preventive treatment. However, to determine whether more cancer patients could benefit from the drug, further clinical trials are required. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul class="public-DraftStyleDefault-ul" data-offset-key="1cum1-0-0"&gt;&lt;li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-reset public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="1cum1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="1cum1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1cum1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Increased risk of bleeding:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="1cum1-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; Aspirin acts as an antiplatelet agent, preventing blood clotting, which can raise the risk of internal bleeding, especially in the gastrointestinal tract and brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="l3nv-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="l3nv-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="l3nv-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Gastrointestinal side effects:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="l3nv-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; Prolonged aspirin use can lead to stomach ulcers, gastritis and bleeding in the digestive tract, particularly in patients with a history of stomach issues or those taking medications that damage the stomach lining.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="boe1p-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="boe1p-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="boe1p-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Variable effects depending on cancer type and patient profile:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="boe1p-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; There are differences between cancer types and patients’ genetic profiles, meaning not all patients may benefit from the treatment, and some may face higher risks of severe side effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="public-DraftStyleDefault-unorderedListItem public-DraftStyleDefault-depth0 public-DraftStyleDefault-listLTR" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="eukuc-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="eukuc-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eukuc-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Interactions with other treatments:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="eukuc-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt; Aspirin can affect the efficacy of other medications, including chemotherapy and anticoagulants, increasing the risk of adverse reactions or reducing the effectiveness of certain treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="cmc01-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta wrapped"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleWrappedImageComponenta"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleWrappedImageData.SJg0ovxsskg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/03/06/HJ11JSMDs1x/HJ11JSMDs1x_697_0_802_1068_0_medium.jpg" alt="פרופ' גיל בר סלע" title="Prof. Gil Bar-Sela  (Photo: Emek Medical Center) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="caption" contenteditable="false"&gt;Prof. Gil Bar-Sela &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span disabled class="credit" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Emek Medical Center&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="5c7ng-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5c7ng-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5c7ng-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Could aspirin have a greater impact on specific types of cancer?
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5c7ng-0-1"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;"Based on available data, aspirin’s effect was more pronounced in breast, stomach and prostate cancers,"  Bar-Sela said. "In other cancer types, its contribution was minimal or insignificant. Extensive studies, including comprehensive reviews, suggest a reduced risk of cancer recurrence and even prevention of initial cancer development among aspirin users." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="8fgmp" data-offset-key="7mphh-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7mphh-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7mphh-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In cases of active metastatic cancer, aspirin alone does not appear strong enough to serve as a primary treatment. However, as a supplement to other treatments, particularly immunotherapy, it may offer some benefits — a topic that warrants further exploration. For now, as studies remain in various stages of investigation, the use of aspirin as a complementary treatment is not recommended for all patients. Instead, it should only be considered within clinical trials or under strict medical supervision.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 12:53:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE0yNTFDaFFkMGY0ZmQ4TGI5aXZZMWU0am1kRVp3aWtoZ1lGOWFTWmxPQmRkRjgwb3BURXR1YmJCXzFYd0ZOejNZV05pTW1sS2xIcHlPcHVfWVg1VkZwaUxzZWwyU2pzb1I5aVE</guid></item><item><title>Shocking stories of people who went blind after taking Ozempic and Mounjaro - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billed by many as miracle drugs for its instant results in weight loss, the 'silver bullet' Ozempic and its cousins have now been linked to vision impairment and blindness, in a growing number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss drugs like Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound have changed millions of lives by helping people shed extra pounds and reach a healthy weight bracket, thus reversing many chronic diseases. While this seems almost magical and holds a great promise for reducing alarming levels of obesity worldwide, some of the scary and irreversible side effects of the drugs have come under the scanner.

Always struggling with weight loss, Norris decided to try obesity drug Mounjaro in March 2023, inspired by his wife’s remarkable 60-pound transformation on the same medication. His earlier attempts at losing weight through diet and exercise didn't translate in results, and weighing 289 pounds, Norris really thought that the drug was an easy alternative to shed some quick pounds. Within a year, Norris lost 89 pounds and was able to stop taking medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol, which seemed to be an encouraging progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While initially he was on 1.5 milligrams dose - a relatively low dose - things changed rapidly for him when the dose was increased to 2.5 milligrams. To his surprise, he woke up with a clouded vision in his left eye one morning. Two weeks later, his right eye became blurry too. At first, he dismissed it as a possible sinus infection, but after a series of medical tests, a neuro-ophthalmologist diagnosed him with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) — a condition in which a sudden loss of blood flow to the optic nerve causes irreversible vision damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was devastated,” he said. “It’s extremely rare to get NAION in both eyes.” While Norris discontinued Mounjaro, he now struggles with daily tasks. Not able to do hands-on-work, he is now forced to do administrative work. He believes the risks associated with these medications, particularly at higher doses, are not worth the potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What studies say about Ozempic blindness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in JAMA Ophthalmology on January 30, 2025, by physician-scientists from the University of Utah’s John A. Moran Eye Center reviewed nine patients who developed serious optic nerve-related conditions after taking semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) or tirzepatide (used in Mounjaro and Zepbound).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven of the patients reported symptoms consistent with NAION, while others experienced optic nerve inflammation (papillitis) or a condition known as paracentral acute middle maculopathy, which can cause blind spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research follows a July 2024 study from Harvard’s Mass Eye and Ear hospital, which found that diabetics taking these drugs had a fourfold increased risk of developing NAION, while overweight or obese individuals taking them solely for weight loss faced a sevenfold risk increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/can-ozempic-cause-sudden-vision-loss-a-study-uncovers-the-link/articleshow/116339266.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; diabetes patients using Ozempic were found to be over twice as likely to develop a rare eye condition known as NAION compared to those taking other diabetes medications, according to researchers who analyzed years of patient data from Denmark and Norway. If the risk remains consistent over time, a type 2 diabetes patient taking Ozempic for 20 years would face a 0.3% to 0.5% likelihood of developing NAION, according to a non-peer reviewed study published Thursday on medRxiv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More horror stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Post report mentions more cases of weight loss drugs causing vision loss in people. Michael Sabellico, 1 60-year-old took Ozempic in March 2024 to manage his Type 2 diabetes and lose weight. Weighing 185 pounds at the time, he initially lost weight successfully. But after eight weeks on a 1.5 mg dose, he woke up one morning unable to see clearly. He was diagnosed with NAION. At that time, there was no proper research around the link between NAION and Ozempic, so doctors actually increased his Ozempic dose to better manage his blood sugar. He finally stopped taking Ozempic in May 2024, but by then, the damage was done. He now has 20/70 vision in his left eye and 20/30 in his right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Bovee, a 56-year-old from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has already filed a lawsuit against Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of Ozempic, for what she calls “deceptive and misleading” marketing that downplayed the risks of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bovee, who used Ozempic as prescribed for diabetes management, is now legally blind after developing NAION. “I can no longer work.

It is the most common type of dementia, affecting two-thirds of those diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recent studies have suggested that diet could play a crucial role in preventing Alzheimer's, sparking interest in the scientific community. The idea that our food intake can impact cognitive abilities in an ageing brain has led to further research into dietary patterns and their potential influence on the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthy eating habits have been linked to cognitive benefits in various studies, but more research is needed to determine if diet can prevent or delay Alzheimer's or age-related cognitive decline. Certain diets are thought to enhance specific nutrients that protect the brain through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; READ MORE - &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/yorkshire-farms-reuben-owen-confirms-31161342" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Our Yorkshire Farm's Reuben Owen 'confirms' new series in exciting announcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; READ MORE - &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/donald-trumps-petty-reaction-king-31161453" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Donald Trump's 'petty' reaction to King Charles meeting Volodymyr Zelensky&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One diet that has shown promise in the prevention of Alzheimer's is the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative delay diet, also known as the MIND diet. While it shares some similarities with the holistic approach of the Mediterranean diet, the MIND diet includes additional food items and restricts others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although this research is still in its early stages, the initial findings offer a ray of hope as scientists continue to investigate, reports &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/alzheimers-risk-reduced-53-people-31134615" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The MIND diet is a fusion of the Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets. The research on this diet, officially known as the Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, was led by Dr. Martha Clare Morris and her team at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their study, published in 2015 in Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association, found that following the MIND diet could significantly reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, even if it's not strictly adhered to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After analysing dietary habits and other factors over an average period of 4.5 years, they discovered that those who stuck closely to the MIND diet had a 53% lower rate of Alzheimer's compared to those who didn't follow the diet as closely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what does the MIND diet entail?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much like its Mediterranean cousin, it encourages the consumption of vegetables, especially leafy greens, and prioritises berries over other fruits. Whole grains, beans, and nuts are also recommended, along with weekly servings of fish and olive oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The diet suggests limiting intake of red meat, sweets, cheese, butter/margarine, and fast/fried food. While the Mediterranean diet is more relaxed about cheese consumption, it also places a broader emphasis on vegetables beyond the MIND diet's focus on leafy varieties and berries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a related study, adhering to the MIND diet was linked with a significant deceleration of cognitive decline over an average span of nearly five years. These encouraging results call for further investigation.As scientists persist in their quest to stave off this incapacitating illness, additional research is underway.In a similar study, following the MIND diet was associated with a substantial slowing of cognitive decline during an average of almost five years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While these findings are promising, more research is necessary. More studies are being conducted by scientists as they continue to make inroads into preventing the debilitating disease.While it is early days for this research, findings so far are cause for cautious optimism as further investigation is undertaken by the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;section data-embed-group="picture" data-embed-items="2" data-ad-dockable="true" data-redesign-embed="true" data-istail="true" data-orientation="landscape"&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31161511" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/healthy-returns-hhs-secretary-rfk-jrs-efforts-could-affect-vaccines.html"&gt;prominent vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, now leads the Department of Health and Human Services and wields enormous power over the federal agencies that regulate vaccines and set shot recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy tried to distance himself from his previous views during his &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/watch-rfk-jr-senate-confirmation-hearing-for-hhs-secretary.html"&gt;Senate confirmation hearings&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that he isn't "anti-vaccine" and would not make it "difficult or discourage people from taking" routine shots for measles and polio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some health policy experts said his early moves as HHS Secretary are concerning and suggest that he could undermine immunizations in other, less direct ways, which could increase the risk of children catching preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The steps that he's taken so far seem to be in line with his views of skepticism about vaccines and their safety, of wanting to allow for parents to not get their children vaccinated. It's all things he's championed," said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy at KFF. "There might be more dominoes to fall coming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said he will review the childhood vaccination schedule, and is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly preparing&lt;/a&gt; to remove and replace members of external committees that advise the government on vaccine approvals and other key public health decisions, among other efforts. Some experts said he could also amplify data highlighting the risks of vaccines, promote unfounded claims about shots and undermine legal protections for vaccine makers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rates drop even more, there could be major consequences, such as renewed outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses in certain communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Within the next couple of years, we could see major drops in childhood vaccination rates," Lawrence Gostin, professor of public health law at Georgetown University, told CNBC. "He has all the powers he needs to sow public distrust in vaccines. He has a history of doing that and he has a desire to do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could lead to significant outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases throughout America, with the disproportionate impact on red states that President Trump carried in the 2024 election," Gostin added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has a long track record of making misleading and false statements about the safety of shots. He has claimed they are linked to autism despite decades of studies that debunk that association. Kennedy is also the founder of the nonprofit Children's Health Defense, the most well-funded anti-vaccine organization in the U.S. In a &lt;a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/F3C8425ED335BB5685258C1A00565D57/%24FILE/Kennedy%2C%20Jr.%2C%20Robert%20F.%20%20finalEA.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;government ethics agreement&lt;/a&gt; in January, he said he stopped serving as chairman or chief legal counsel for the organization as of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But vaccines have saved the lives of more than 1.1 million children in the U.S. and saved Americans &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/childhood-vaccines-have-prevented-half-billion-illnesses-saved-us-27-trillion-3#:~:text=The%20investigators%20found%20that%2C%20among,%242.7%20trillion%20in%20societal%20costs." target="_blank"&gt;$540 billion in direct health-care costs&lt;/a&gt; over the last three decades, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research released&lt;/a&gt; in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States and local jurisdictions set vaccine requirements for school children, but the federal government has a longstanding system for approving and recommending shots for the public. That includes creating the childhood vaccination schedule, which recommends when children should receive certain shots. It's used by states, pediatricians and parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why have childhood vaccination rates fallen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood vaccinations and the state requirements in place for them have been "one of the greatest public health success stories" in the U.S., allowing the country to eliminate many diseases that people once feared, such as polio, according to William Moss, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates stayed relatively steady for nearly a decade before the Covid pandemic, as about 95% of kindergarten children were up to date with all state required vaccines, Moss said. That includes separate shots for polio and varicella, a vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella – called MMR – as well as a jab that protects against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the share of kindergarten children who are up to date on their vaccinations has dipped since the pandemic, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data collected and aggregated annually&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC from state and local immunization programs. Less than 93% of kindergarteners had received all state required vaccines in the 2023-2024 school year, data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Exemptions&lt;/a&gt; from school vaccination requirements, particularly non-medical exemptions, have also increased, according to the CDC. The share of U.S. children claiming an exemption from one or more shots rose from 2.5% in the 2019-2020 school year to 3.3% in the 2023-2024 school year, the highest national exemption rate to date. Nearly all of that increase was driven by non-medical exemptions, such as religious or personal belief reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decrease appears consistent with the public's perception of childhood immunizations. A Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;survey released&lt;/a&gt; in August found only 40% of Americans said they considered childhood vaccines extremely important, down from 58% in 2019 and 64% in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall decline is fueled in part by vaccine skepticism, a trend that "certainly existed far before the pandemic," KFF's Michaud said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy and the anti-vaccine movement have been around globally for decades. They are often intertwined with political, moral and spiritual ideas around the rights of an individual versus the community, the limits of government power over bodily autonomy, mistrust of medical institutions and misinformation about shot safety and efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The politicization of the pandemic only fueled more doubts about vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It created a partisan divide on the public's acceptance of the Covid vaccine, according to Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious diseases. Social media and public figures amplified misinformation about Covid jabs, and some of those "falsehoods about Covid shots spilled over to an extent to other types of vaccinations," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a very precipitous drop [in vaccination rates] right when the pandemic hit, in those first few months afterwards," O'Leary said. "And we never really completely caught up." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Leary noted that the vast majority of parents on both sides of the political spectrum continue to vaccinate their kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, surveys suggest that the partisan division on immunizations has deepened in recent years. In 2024, 63% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters said childhood vaccinations were "extremely important," compared to just 26% of Republicans and GOP leaners, according to the August Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years earlier, enthusiasm was just slightly higher among the Democratic group at 67%, and double among Republican respondents at 52%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are "certainly political ideologies that are driving vaccine policy in certain areas of the country," which has a "clear downstream impact on vaccination levels," said Dr. Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over three-quarters of U.S. states, or 39, had vaccination rates for the MMR shot below the "Healthy People 2030" target rate of 95% during the 2023-2024 school year. That refers to the level needed to prevent community transmission of measles, a highly contagious and deadly virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data means that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;roughly 280,000 school children&lt;/a&gt; were unvaccinated and unprotected against measles during that school year, according to the CDC. MMR vaccination rates among kindergarteners vary across states, ranging from a low of around 80% in Idaho to a high of more than 98% in West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moss noted that clusters of unvaccinated people within a specific community increase the risk of disease outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where you're going to get these larger outbreaks like we're seeing in Texas right now with measles," Moss said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child who wasn't vaccinated died in the outbreak in rural West Texas, state officials said in late February, the first U.S. death from the disease since 2015. The childhood vaccination rate for measles in Gaines County, the epicenter of the current outbreak in Texas, is just below 82%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second patient, an unvaccinated adult in New Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;tested positive for measles after death&lt;/a&gt;, state officials said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy last week said shots protect communities from measles, but emphasized that the decision to vaccinate "is a personal one." He also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;pushed unconventional treatment regimens&lt;/a&gt; for measles, including cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Kennedy could target vaccine advisory panels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's HHS already appears to be targeting a key part of U.S. vaccine policy: external advisors to the government health agencies that approve shots and set recommendations for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government postponed a meeting of vaccine advisors to the CDC and&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-cancels-meeting-select-flu-strains-seasons-shots-rcna193931" target="_blank"&gt; a separate meeting of advisors&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Drug Administration, the latter of which is crucial to determining the flu strains in next season's shots. It is unclear why the meetings were canceled or when they will be rescheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108087127" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seen in Silver Spring, Maryland November 4, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Jason Reed | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One "clear step" Kennedy can also take to undermine vaccinations is removing members of those advisory panels that shape the government's shot recommendations, including which jabs are covered at no cost by different types of insurance, according to Georgetown's Gostin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several reports have said Kennedy plans to replace members whom he perceives to have "conflicts of interest," though it is unclear how many people will be outed or when. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gostin called conflicts of interest one of Kennedy's "code words" for "simply purging hard working, experienced scientists from advisory committees and replacing them with those that are more skeptical of shots." All HHS agencies and their advisory panels have rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years, he noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's shake-up of advisory committees could produce "bogus recommendations" that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots, according to Gostin. He said those recommendations could influence governors, legislatures and school boards in red states, which could adopt policies that reduce childhood immunizations and "create wide-open opt outs of shots." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations could also create greater distrust in the CDC and Trump administration among scientists and public health experts, including Gostin himself, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108108637" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Sherry Andrews prepares a MMR vaccine at the City of Lubbock Heath Department in Lubbock, Texas, U.S. Feb. 27, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Annie Rice | Reuters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will have a longer-term corrosive effect on the value of science in America, which is already under severe attack," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is also reviewing the childhood immunization schedule. Experts said that could lead to removing recommendations for certain vaccines or changing their suggested use from "routine" – when the default approach is to vaccinate – to more of an individual choice guided by discussions with a health-care provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that officials on the state and local level influence policy or implement practices to drive higher vaccination rates, said Northeastern's Maniar. State and local governments may need to "expand the work they do" in some cases to "make up lost ground" and advocate for vaccinations, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Cherry-picking data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy could also cherry-pick data, studies and any other information about vaccines that "create the misleading impression that shots aren't safe and cause severe side effects," according to Gostin. He said Kennedy could include them in official government announcements to undermine the public's faith in shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the campaign trail, Kennedy said he wanted to "restore the transparency" around vaccine safety data and records that he accused HHS officials of hiding. Gostin called transparency another "code word" for "highlighting dubious scientific studies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Kennedy's wording suggests that the government's existing vaccine information is not transparent, when databases recording adverse events and immunization rates have long been fully open to the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-106686395" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Antonio Perez | Chicago Tribune | Tribune News Service | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is reportedly shelving promotions for a variety of shots, including a campaign touting seasonal flu jabs. He wanted the CDC's advertisements to promote the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making instead, STAT News &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/#:~:text=Kennedy%20Jr.,any%20drug%20they%20are%20prescribed." target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in February. That refers to giving patients important information, including possible risks or benefits of a medical treatment, such as adverse events associated with shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have said while informed consent is important, shifting the framing of advertisements for shots that the CDC has long recommended to focus more on the potential risks could undermine people's willingness to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When a parent exercises informed consent not to have their child immunized with measles, it certainly puts that child at risk, but it puts every child in that school with them at risk," Gostin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy would need approval from Congress to change the existing legal liability protections in place for vaccine makers, but he could still undermine them in other ways, experts said. HHS' National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program currently pays patients injured by standard childhood vaccines and shields drugmakers from litigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As HHS secretary, Kennedy can remove or add to the list of vaccines and injuries included and covered by that program, Michaud said. Any changes to the list could change some liability protections for vaccine makers, potentially spurring a wave of litigation over alleged injuries from the shots, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 11:02:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNMllpZVJlZG5IbTFYMWtlTVlxbDRsRDczODRXYjhZa3FIQm5hU0FNdDFwOGpVT0EtVi02WUxBa3VoQnZPb0VIQ2RUN19WV09pTTJpQ3V2OEpPdTBma0hTdzlOQUFxVEJnV3N5TTZQTkM4eFp1ckk2X1VrVnBaMUhyZVVfUDhPUGVEQ3pDUmlGYWVKVXN2Q291STQ4VVFERjJYWHNoS1pB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE1DZGNweHE2WFJGdXk3ZnZBd1B1WEpURUcyTzNOWU5zWHRmMTRmUThyWmotUHgwNVhzWTJXN2pOTFRyaDdMWFNxOGxScmJkTkJkazluUTJwSlU2d3NJWmdiNXhXZ0FVM0E2RVFpaWNGbGNheTdmTGhMLWRmSloyeTJyR2syZTdJdFhoRVB5aVRMRVNjbG1wakxxeHVHbE1GZ2ppcG0tNlJtRFUydw</guid></item><item><title>Expert reveals the BIGGEST mistake people on Ozempic are making - massively increasing side effect risk - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A GP has revealed the six biggest mistakes people make while taking revolutionary weight-loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sold under the brands Wegovy and Mounjaro, as well as the off-label prescriptions of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-d6b7d080-fb79-11ef-a070-1f9934b25383"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drug Ozempic, the injections have become an increasingly popular option for people needing, or wanting, to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-d6b8bae0-fb79-11ef-a070-1f9934b25383"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At least half a million &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-5e5593b0-f855-11ef-8279-ffcfdae8d660" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; patients and some 15million in the US are now thought to be using the jabs, which can help patients shed up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a handful of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But family medic Dr Donald Grant, from The Independent Pharmacy, said there were a number of errors people could make when starting out on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned that not only could these mistakes derail patients' weight-loss plans, some could even land them in A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the most common — and serious — mistakes slimmers make is taking too much too soon, Dr Grant said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both Wegovy and Mounjaro patients typically start on weekly 0.25mg jabs for four weeks, before increasing the dosage in stages from there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Grant said patients may be tempted to up the dosage under the logic of 'more is better', this was false and potentially dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Semaglutide and tirzepatide — the powerful ingredients behind Wegovy, Ozempic and Mounjaro — have long been hailed a monumental breakthrough in the war on obesity and type 2 diabetes  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Contrary to popular belief, taking a higher dosage of the medication does not necessarily mean quicker results,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our bodies need time to adjust to the treatment, so beginning on a high dosage could greatly increase the intensity of symptoms such as headaches, fatigue and nausea.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could also increase the risk of rarer but more serious side effects like pancreatitis, a serious inflammation of the pancreas, and hypoglycaemia, a medical term for potentially dangerous blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Grant added: 'I advise anyone on the treatment to discuss their dosage with a licensed health professional, rather than increasing the strength on their own accord.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another mistake was taking a weight-loss drug without actually acquiring it legitimately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have long warned they are seeing increasing numbers of slim women needing emergency treatment after obtaining the drug from chemists by lying about their weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was recently revealed that a 16-year-old girl &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14457245/high-street-Boots-selling-weight-loss-jabs-children-teens.html"&gt;was able to buy Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; at Boots as part of an undercover sting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Grant said patients obtaining the drug from unreliable sources were taking additional risks.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A common mistake that’s unfortunately being seen more and more is the amount of Brits obtaining these treatments through illegal measures - such as fraudulent sites or social media,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can be an incredibly dangerous process as these organisations aren’t regulated with the same level of health safety protocols as proper healthcare establishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a result, they could have foreign ingredients that could impact well-being.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35, or between 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mounjaro has similar restrictions under NHS guidelines, with patients needing a BMI of more than 35 and at least one obesity-related health problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic, on the other hand, is a diabetes medication but has been prescribed for weight loss 'off label'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Grant said another mistake patients frequently make is feeling they can 'eat whatever they like' while on the medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sadly, this is simply not the case and eating too many processed or sugary foods could cause blood sugar spikes, leading to increased appetite, bloating and fatigue,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People should prioritise a well-balanced diet of proteins, fibre and other key nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although these treatments impact appetite, it’s still important to draw up a dietary plan that includes all the key foods.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a similar vein, Dr Grant said patients should also ensure they stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not doing so risks increasing the intensity of side effects, which can be difficult to manage - particularly for people still adjusting to the medication,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Water is also a key component for weight loss, not drinking enough can slow down progress and lead to dehydration.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On side effects in general, Dr Grant also said it was critical that patients don't ignore them and inform their medical team of any issues so they can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By keeping your GP up to date with any symptoms, they can provide tailored advice and guidance to lessen side effects and restore a better quality of life,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Common side effects include diarrhoea, nausea and fatigue, while less common symptoms range from shortness of breath to abdominal pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wegovy and Ozempic work by triggering the body to produce a hormone called GLP-1 that is released naturally from the intestines after meals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If any side effects persist, I strongly recommend seeking medical attention for further advice.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Grant's final tip was to ensure you don't skip doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can halt progress, stopping people from reaching their weight loss goals, as it can increase appetite and reduce the overall effectiveness of the treatment,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, before beginning any weight loss medication, be sure to consider the long-term costs and reordering processes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight loss jabs work by mimicking a natural hormone that makes people feel full, reducing their appetite and helping people lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While hailed as a breakthrough in tackling obesity, the drugs have also been shown to significantly reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, side effects are wide-ranging, from nausea and abdominal pain to severe digestive issues, bone pain and a potential higher risk of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14317293/ozempic-weight-jabs-skinny-deadly-cancer-diagnosis.html"&gt;thyroid cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Mail on Sunday &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14300503/Hundreds-hospital-fat-jabs-numbers-surge.html"&gt;investigation &lt;/a&gt;earlier this year also revealed almost 400 patients had been hospitalised — some with life-threatening complications — since the rollout of the jabs in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 10:45:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOWlNGMzRpZHRYZ3FCLUY5d2Jhb2Z1enFGWFpnU19VLTJ1Vm1iSVM5WFVUYV9TYnVtaFdtMVpJM2Q2VzJwRFJ0SDk3WFNFUE90T0d4TE5BVHJwakdBQUxpQk5rX0VIODNJd1dnY3BUMTNncjh0cnFCTDVPcE1md2t3RklMSUNHTWM0cm5LYkFxWktaaUc1aGhQVUp1OUpKa2JTdU9ueVFwaEZCNnFlaXfSAbMBQVVfeXFMTXg2aFdIdFFMQ29NSXpHYkFBemxXS3R2TkxVRHExRVVsaTdkN2lLRlNueHR5T2JSRVVUdFVuSVhDRjFHMUFZZmpDdUpudmpFcEh2QnpIODI4RlZyMmc2ZXVaV3EzT3dweTRubkwyZGo1WnlDNXRrRjMyY3hZSnlqWFk0WlRBODdURngydmdHWWlRRHJLQm9udjExODhhT2hpTkxkYnlQOUVoYW4wWXRYcnRMd1U</guid></item><item><title>10 foods to pair with almonds to boost brain health -

There have been previous publications supporting this and it’s great to see additional evidence,” he noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, we are rapidly acquiring more information and evidence regarding the benefits of resistance exercise,” Williams continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I frequently speak with my middle-aged and elderly patients about the importance of combating &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318501" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;sarcopenia&lt;/a&gt; and the critical importance of preventing falls, as well as the protective aspects of lean muscle mass during health crises.

It’s always best to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Nadeem Ali, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Next steps [for this research] could include conducting long-term studies to assess the sustained effectiveness of different insomnia treatments in older adults and identify factors that predict long-term success and developing and testing strategies to help older adults maintain improvements in sleep habits and prevent relapse after completing treatment,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/geriatric-medicine/ca/santa-monica/scott-kaiser-1205042470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified geriatrician and Director of Geriatric Cognitive Health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; he was pleased to see research in this area as insomnia is a significant issue for countless people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Older adults have more significant insomnia than younger people, and the rates […] are just quite high,” Kaiser explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And poor sleep has so many profound impacts on many aspects of our health and well-being, […] the management of other chronic conditions, and just healthy aging overall. Two things that are really critical for healthy aging [are] good quality sleep and maintaining regular physical activity. Excellent to see that the research ties these things together as two things that can go hand-in-hand to really benefit us immediately and over the long haul.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Scott Kaiser, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser also spoke of the importance for more research in this area due to our “unprecedented population aging where […] for the first time in human history we have &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018/cb18-41-population-projections.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;more people over the age of 65&lt;/a&gt; than under the age of 18.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And when you consider all of the profound effects of insomnia and poor sleep quality on the overall health and well-being of older adults, and the connection with increased risks of dementia and other chronic diseases, this is just really critical,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we don’t invest in this type of research now, it would be easy to say, ‘oh, well, who cares,’ or to be dismissive. But if we don’t increase our investment in this type of research now, there will be significant social, health, and economic repercussions for decades to come,” Kaiser cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 06:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQb0JQbmNyT05iNmJmT280WEpjV2laMzhhNEpPU3VBakVsbVByRktjTHVxTlE2bFlDN2QzUUFwaWl1TzFPMTBaZHhpRmhIb0k5aU5lckhaUGt0bElNazhndktvOV9uXzV4N3JJMDZpN3VFQ3Qwam9USVpneHlKazNYNmxCbE1VVjFLUFZuWURQVmpiSVdGMDVFY3hiWFRtUEpIRHhr</guid></item><item><title>ChatGPT gets 'anxiety,' and researchers are teaching it mindfulness to 'soothe' it - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQYS03WnQ3eEdiM0NOUXNYX2x4TnZBNDlSc04tSFZrMUFyUnpXSkxEQTJBYjd2dTYzazhiV2w5UFA0MVV4UUVHazVyU2d5N0FuSzJQemhMU3ZOZG5MQmlZYzQyU1pvWG1RanlTbHR5MFo4Z21mVUp6VUFHbkZSQkNIWUNudVNWSzV6SF9GOFJzNkVnRzZHOWtKUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 05:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQYS03WnQ3eEdiM0NOUXNYX2x4TnZBNDlSc04tSFZrMUFyUnpXSkxEQTJBYjd2dTYzazhiV2w5UFA0MVV4UUVHazVyU2d5N0FuSzJQemhMU3ZOZG5MQmlZYzQyU1pvWG1RanlTbHR5MFo4Z21mVUp6VUFHbkZSQkNIWUNudVNWSzV6SF9GOFJzNkVnRzZHOWtKUw</guid></item><item><title>No disease is deadlier in Africa than malaria.
