I tried to stave off the inevitable by submerging myself in ice baths and drinking a brand of coffee that claimed to improve cognition. I paid too much for eye creams (to erase dark circles) and hair volumizers (to make my mane look fuller). I whitewashed my résumé, eliminating the year I graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6MK5ET53IZDBDNEASI5YMLRIHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I thought I needed to hide my age because of the ageism surrounding me: advertisements that depicted people my age as decrepit and frail, birthday cards that mocked us as deaf or daffy, and other media that simply erased us. For sure, I was not going gently into that good night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U65RTG35TFFN7AOVJ45D4OWQWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It took me several more years to understand that there are different ways to understand ageism, including what researchers call “internalized ageism,” or discriminating against ourselves — and our contemporaries — as we age. Or as Todd D. Nelson, a professor of psychology at California State University at Stanislaus, who edited the book “Ageism,” put it: “&lt;a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00402.x?casa_token=Ki9-NmUKaHgAAAAA%3ARDOX-t29125hQrR2P5ZYcPhkHGPnOCIAbsXxjtoh_NqwhlEi8CdOdQQTSmZQMwle8QuyJ2r7GR53" target="_blank"&gt;prejudice against our feared future self&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C27WBUPA5NFBJE5QF2SDABB65E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sure, those of us 55-plus face negative stereotypes, bias and discrimination — in health care (exclusion from clinical trials because of age), on the job (being passed over for promotion) and by the media (all those “look younger” ads). But I finally realized that the antiaging messages I was hearing weren’t just coming from others. The awareness set me on a path to reverse my own aging biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QKM6M65MZAJ3OAL4SCCKH7ZIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Negative &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07317115.2024.2355539#d1e223" target="_blank"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; with getting older have their own &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9757993/" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="525DQQCQBBFURN3CEAGJT6VEOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LjiIqQDNPQ" target="_blank"&gt;Becca Levy&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at Yale University and a leading researcher on the psychology of aging, has written that internalized ageism may take as much as 7.5 years off your life — about the same as heavy smoking. Levy argues in her book, “Breaking the Age Code: How Your Beliefs About Aging Determine How Long and Well You Live,” that those under 60 who hold negative aging stereotypes (frailty, cognitive decline) are more likely to have a heart attack or develop other cardiovascular conditions after they turn 60 than those who make positive associations with getting older (wisdom, loyalty, reliability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7IKKE4BZPNEI7DHTXUW4UM744Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The way we think about aging affects how we age,” Levy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWTQWKBSEBFQ7P3PZIXPEVDUYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These negative associations get baked into our culture and our memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZ3F3AH6QRGCTJPVXZIBUFTRA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it doesn’t have to be that way. Yes, we can change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DFL3CCX6PJGTJAXL642LHEL7GA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="DFL3CCX6PJGTJAXL642LHEL7GA"&gt;Embracing the positives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DARHBFTOIZGNROXI7JTIEOR2QM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For my reset, I first turned to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/06/02/middle-age-midlife-transformation-retirementchrysalis/" target="_blank"&gt;Chip Conley&lt;/a&gt;, the author of “Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder.” Conley is also the founder of the &lt;a href="https://www.meawisdom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Modern Elder Academy&lt;/a&gt; (MEA), a retreat center designed to help those in midlife navigate its challenges, whether they stem from retirement, empty nest syndrome, divorce or aging. I joined one of his retreats in 2022, on the cusp of turning 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7VGHTSDVBHK5AXZBYH2DGPPHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the MEA, I spent a week with 19 other individuals, hearing admissions such as, “It’s too late for me to learn new things,” or “I’m past the age where I can reinvent myself.” Conley warned us of the dangers of a “closed mindset,” or becoming rigid, fearing change and even believing it’s just too late for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RFHYOGITK5F7VNBBLNTCEH7RO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In an exercise called the Great Midlife Edit, we wrote down our associations with getting older on bits of paper. (You already know mine, which were very similar to the others’.) We then tossed these scraps — representing our old mindsets — into a bonfire, watching them incinerate. “We’re letting go,” a new friend said excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B4BAHWFEGBCHDBXN75WJSANZBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the second day, Conley asked us to describe what he called “a replacement mindset” — a list of the positives of aging. There are plenty, including greater experience and wisdom, less judgment of others and more acceptance of ourselves, even increased contentment or equilibrium. I understood what Conley was saying, but it was going to take time for me to fully grasp the import of his message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ"&gt;Putting beliefs into practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K7I6XJO545FSJOG2GETW4FHUR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After the MEA, I began to think about intention and practice. Levy has outlined a three-stage process of bolstering positive age beliefs. The first is increasing awareness: “We know from our research that we often [hold] age beliefs without awareness and they can operate unconsciously.” She noted that children as young as 3 often internalize the age beliefs of the culture around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWBCGCDF2REC7PTSDXZYQ75APY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To combat this, Levy recommends journaling, “which involves writing down all the age beliefs you encounter over one week.” Was the portrayal positive or negative? Or were older people absent from a movie or a show, “because we know that lack of representation … can lead to them becoming marginalized as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OYFHY4IRD5GMXG4OOJAVE6KLFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her second exercise is to ask yourself: “Is what is said about older people ageist?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SFWCTIMMFB2XD56FJJAAO5A6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ageism is considered one of the last acceptable forms of discrimination and can be challenging to call out. When you’re not sure if you’re seeing bias, Levy suggests changing the target to another marginalized group, such as women: “If an employee states the need to fire older workers, ask yourself how it would sound if the same comments were made about firing women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QN3VORSGH5F45BKQ7HD7PFCFEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally, she recommends an exercise to dismantle negative age beliefs “by countering them with accurate information.” Consider the belief that cognition inevitably declines as we get older. “In fact, a number of types of cognition have been found to improve later in life, including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697608/" target="_blank"&gt;metacognition&lt;/a&gt;, or thinking about thinking,” Levy told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XCLFIPEUQRFYBONLROGVTNTRXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Using her framework, I made a handful of pledges about how to reframe aging. Recently, I pointed out to a gift shop manager that the store sold only birthday cards that mocked older people. The manager, roughly my age, first took umbrage and then got my point, promising to order a different line. Similarly, when people tell me, “You look good for your age,” I nicely explain that that’s damning praise and ageist, because it implies most people my age look awful. (I know I’m looking a gift horse in the mouth.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y7PJZUFB6VEIFNS2YQHWG43ONU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m also trying to discourage the “organ recital,” that endless discussion of aches, illnesses and surgeries that dominates older folks’ social chatter and perpetuates negative stereotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4NL7H4G6KFEVXPR7MK4FZGVS5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last and most challenging, I’ve stopped lying about my age, especially on dating apps. On my birthday this year, I posted a selfie, paraphrasing Gloria Steinem’s famous declaration, “This is what 40 looks like, ” except in my case, the caption read, “This is what 67 looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AGJ4KS4JQVB7ZD6FLYGZINSUSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m not done, and will probably never be, but there are more benefits to be reaped. The authors of a study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-832261.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;note that inner acceptance of aging leads to less anger and anxiety and greater “calmness and serenity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YAZRKAMK5VBM7P6JIOEGGSDXOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’m also reminded of what &lt;a href="https://awcim.arizona.edu/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2-Fellowship-USA%20(PSDW)&amp;amp;utm_term=integrative%20medicine%20andrew%20weil&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6oi4BhD1ARIsAL6pox0fm59KSCslsIHHhaVUdAMEe_33QtQHUhVmCo07UiZP1fcIWmyCNBIaArhfEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Weil&lt;/a&gt;, founder of the Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona and author of “Healthy Aging: A Lifelong Guide to Your Well-Being,” has written: “We are not hostages to our fate.” Indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 15:02:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVGFUUVJiRW5SMXd5US1JS05RQlNmdUFZS0ZDS2ZCaDlDSmoxeGhzSFJvSGdEM3JkUnltVXEwaE5uZGM2R3NUVnY5WGRvZUpKczloaFZhaWlHSkM2SExVbkFkU0NGWXYzVW9NV2NmSlNHRnV0cGpsdktWVll5dVE1amlHejNnb2g5ZGlYUXVnNm53Vjg4NTdkSklvWEI</guid></item><item><title>Kennedy Jr backtracks and says US measles outbreak is now a ‘top priority’ for health department - The Guardian US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQcmJpTjdaUXp4UFNIeXNOdmZMZk04MFNZczNUQS01dmJyWVdkTVBpbndMWTZDZzc4ZWpIaXd3T3hodEx5LTVWV2RNZ0FFbXdjWVQwdmdBaFJmb21Kc0dRdDlvb2dCRUp5dTR1d3ZHbVNrUTFHc0s1ODl3NU5RTFNZUEotVS1LcE8wVFh1TVR2YTNPbjZaMUVmTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Two days after initially downplaying the outbreak as “not unusual,” the US health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;

meant to be given to children in a series of two shots at 12 to 15 months old as well as between the ages of four and six years old – through its immunization program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Earlier, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) upheld the role of vaccines in offering protection against measles after an unvaccinated child died from an infection this week. The death, reported on Wednesday, was the first US fatality from the highly contagious disease in a decade. Government data shows a growing outbreak with more than 140 cases reported in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The child’s death and the hospitalization of nearly 20 other patients in Texas have put Kennedy’s vaccine views to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy founded the Children’s Health Defense anti-vaccine group.

Last year’s flu season had 470,000 influenza-related hospitalizations, the CDC estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4QJEYVJPSRBBJMMBYS6OYYYDZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Anita K. Patel, a pediatric critical-care doctor at Children’s National Hospital in D.C., said this is the worst flu season she has seen in more than a decade. Most children recover from the flu, but getting infected can sometimes result in long-term or debilitating side effects that many people do not consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2HEII3JFWRA3DCKYLDUUNNRQ7E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Death is obviously the most severe outcome, but there is a huge spectrum between well and not well,” Patel said. “The flu can take a previously healthy kid and land them on a ventilator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PG6X5A5EMVBGDBCJY3LHCMOFLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Doctors say early symptoms like dehydration or difficulty breathing should not be ignored, as they can indicate a more severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5FKKWEVNCBHQBBSIQSAWQUTPUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Patel added that while cases at her hospital have started to decline, the tail end of this flu season could last a few more months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ZDNX66V6VBAXNBWYWGEBXL7KTM" data-apitype="header" level="3" id="ZDNX66V6VBAXNBWYWGEBXL7KTM"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy, vaccine effectiveness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DTGSOW7665H2FPGP3YIVFEMMRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Despite public health recommendations, flu vaccination rates among children have been declining in recent years.

To date, there have been over 130 cases across Texas and New Mexico, with 18 patients hospitalised, local health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the nation's newly confirmed top health official, called the Texas outbreak "not unusual", a claim disputed by doctors and local residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Public health experts and Lubbock residents said the health secretary's past remarks about childhood vaccines - as well as actions he's taken related to them since entering office - could fuel an outbreak that is worrying parents across Texas and nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We just want people to be healthy, and it's definitely hard to do that when we have voices in our ears from leadership who don't share those same factual opinions," Leah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;In Lubbock, worried parents and doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the beginning of the outbreak, Katherine Wells, the director of the Lubbock Public Health Department, has not had a day off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She has hosted vaccine clinics to encourage people to get shots, contacted those whose children may have been exposed, and worked to educate the community about the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's as stressful, if not more stressful, than it was at the beginning of the COVID pandemic," she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Wells worries most about those who are not able to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease, which spreads easily in the air and on surfaces, and when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - also is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People who are immunocompromised, children under the age of one and pregnant people cannot be inoculated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That includes the new baby Lubbock resident Kyle Rable is expecting.

We can't do that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, said Alefiyah Malbari, the chief of ambulatory pediatrics at University of Texas Dell Medical School in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But several western Texas communities are well below that figure, including Gaines County where the outbreak began and where only 82% of kindergartners are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"When you have that many children that are unvaccinated, measles will spread very, very easily within the community," said Jill Weatherhead, a professor of infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now, doctors say, parents far from western Texas are starting to worry too. Dr Malbari is getting more calls from parents anxious about protecting their children when not everyone will get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I share that concern with them," said Dr Malbari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Kennedy stays mum on vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Before Kennedy's confirmation as the top US health official, public health experts sounded alarms about the vaccine skeptic's ability to manage outbreaks, like the one the US is seeing now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has repeated widely debunked claims about vaccines, including unsubstantiated theories that the shots can cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;During his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy said he supported the measles vaccination. He pledged not to discourage people from vaccinations and to "do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult" to get vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But since taking office just weeks ago, he has announced a number of plans related to vaccines, including an investigation into whether the childhood vaccination schedule - including measles vaccinations - has contributed to a rise in chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He also delayed the first meeting of a CDC advisory panel that helps the agency make recommendations on what vaccines - including childhood immunisations - insurers should cover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kennedy told the CDC to halt promotions of several immunisations, including a seasonal flu vaccine campaign, instead promoting the idea of "informed consent" in vaccine decision-making, Stat News &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The moves have the potential to disrupt how the federal government ensures  Americans have access to safe vaccines, including childhood immunisations, said Dr Peter Lurie, a former US Food and Drug Administration official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But, Dr Lurie added, most troubling about Kennedy's response to the measles outbreak, is "what he didn't say, which is that the way to contain this outbreak is with vaccination".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, during his first public appearance as health secretary, Kennedy made claims about the measles outbreak that local health officials have since disputed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In addition to calling the Texas outbreak "not unusual", he claimed children with measles went to hospitals only to be quarantined. Hospital officials said they were taken there because of the severity of their illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ron Cook, a family physician and Lubbock health official who is helping doctors respond to the outbreak, said the community has not seen measles cases like this in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a devastating disease," he said. "And it's completely preventable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Vaccines as a 'choice'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For some expectant parents in Lubbock, Kennedy's minimisation of the outbreak has been difficult to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Leah said she knows many local parents who won't vaccinate their children because of misinformation about safety. She said news of the death has not changed their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If anything, it's just made them double down on their beliefs," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But Ms Wells has seen at least a few encouraging signs. After the death was announced on Wednesday, around 18 people came to a vaccination clinic following many slow days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, she said, when she tells parents their children may have been exposed, some still do not want to vaccinate, including doses of the shot that can protect them after potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In Texas, vaccines are very much a choice," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Local health officials are working overtime to build trust and show that the vaccine is safe and effective, Dr Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We're seeing some success, but we would like to see significantly more," he said.  "It would be nice to have some confidence coming out of the powers that be - at the national level - to show that this is a good vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 08:33:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE81eGNfdEFQT2txcG1aY2pzSWhlWEtveFUyMXg0d013VUxIWTdTSFkzWkNXTGJYSE1rdXNFNVQ5Wi1DbGpBMWpsaTR5QlN2VjJIWEZlWTNOQ19MUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1WS0sxOHpVOXFMM0RwdzMyblpxa3hKNFBwSjYtVk1QN1V5dGFpMTlTWXdYR1pUOW9KVWdNWFRmWWFlNHctSXdmQTF3VkdONkFzS0VseDVjTHVlaW14TkJn</guid></item><item><title>1 Gram Of This Nutrient Can Slow Down Ageing (And It’s Very Common!) - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOUmgxaDVZS0NVQjllb19maDZyOXVWX2FpZENjbXlMa21TV1BhY28zSVJqS2lHWWZXdk5EMVZIZjJhT1pYMFFsYnptclQ3MTdvbUhJV050blJ4RmJzdkk4VmhJZ1hHMDZWeGE2YmlYalRvVFhVMnBseTQ4VDJONzd2U2lYWE1LU3ZyX3JLaGd0d3BEd2w5VE9Ra3RmWjR3d9IBpAFBVV95cUxOX3dVU0NMQUk5Umt1X3hnNlVZWjhPaWUzbXFvYlZjT3lnQmVJbVlycENxWTd4ZjNiWVg4djlueUp0OVhxN2F0MFdSdldxSGNVaGZRVWdWV3VQR0FwY1pOT05EOHNnQThZNEV1MXNFUDEzMzE0SHkwTDJ2WDJvZFE3M0hOOUxKZTlXTk1EZEgtb3lHTVZMdGYtbjRxN3lYT0pBcVFoWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you hit a, let’s say, &lt;em&gt;certain age&lt;/em&gt;, you notice that &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/anti-ageing/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="anti-ageing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bde115e4b0d509934a48e0" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/anti-ageing/" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;anti-ageing&lt;/a&gt; promises are everywhere.

The vaccinations provide 97% protection once both shots are administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the high protection rate the vaccinations give, some parents remain concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There’s still a 3% chance of them contracting the disease, and again, I hope that doesn’t happen and it’s less likely, but it’s all risks,” parent Molly Gray told KOMO News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents like Gray are ensuring their children are fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually just called our doctor to make sure our 4-year-old was fully vaccinated because I think 4 is the age where they can have their second dose and we double-checked because we want them to be as protected as possible," Gray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/child-dies-measles-texas-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-deadly-illness-rfk-jr-department-state-health-services-snohomish-county-health-department-doh" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Child dies in measles outbreak in Texas as Washington officials urge vaccinations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silvia Maggio, another parent, expressed relief at having vaccinated her children but acknowledged the vulnerability of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We got the alerts about where that child had been, and we had also been to the ER at Seattle Children’s in recent weeks,” said Maggio. “I feel grateful that we’ve had the opportunity to get those MMR vaccinations out of the way but there are a lot of vulnerable children who don’t have that opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials advise checking vaccination status and recommend contacting a doctor before visiting if exposure or symptoms are suspected to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, King County reported three measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world’s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,” said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. “There’s only a few viruses that even come close to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had measles once can’t get it again, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can measles be fatal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually doesn’t kill people, but it can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven’t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis — which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s deadly “in a little less than 1% of cases, mainly in children,” said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. “Children develop the most severe illness. The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you prevent measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got” measles, Weaver said. "But then when the vaccine came along, that was a complete game-changer and one of the most successful vaccines in the history of medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is “great data” on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any of these outbreaks we’re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,” he said. “If we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we’re not going to see this happening in the future. And we’ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you need a booster if you got the MMR vaccine a while ago?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care professionals are sometimes tested for antibodies to measles and given boosters if necessary, Weaver said — even if they’ve already had the standard two doses as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may also want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I don’t think everyone needs to go and run out to their doctor right now if they did receive two doses as a child,” he said. "If people would just get the standard vaccination, none of this would be happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press reporter Laura Ungar contributed to this report. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 04:07:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxObWFWOTdMTWxuZWpYNTMyYVR3MDZkUk1EbzZKWDhKVDVkalYxSWJHaHlkcGQ2UUFOSk51VmNXQ2ZValN2YjU1eEx5SWloUm85TXhBNnRCV0Rlb0oyVkRtdENYSzlYeVV3Sjl6azVPemJIYndHX1lVa1NYUTNmX2NYT29LQmVLd3ZkNGc0SkF6V3haMXRjbnRUYWZEV3FHY1hLa1JvV3lGN093eUF0OFdla2tiQ2pJSndMS2QxeEgyN0dVbExBQUwwY3B1aDk5Y3RVR0hNUC16d2l2azN4MDdsZWdMYnV2dWFwc0VsVS13</guid></item><item><title>Health officials say they have a confirmed measles case reported in Austin - KVUE.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNR25GdUFGWXdPQnlFQjJvLVZWMGZQb2JWalVteUR1cWo0RnQ1a1hjOS1ZYUtuc0tVenJxVlJwbUFTbHp5empMNGpiR0xaTWFKaTRIOER6WFNNRk8zR3Znbi1xdjNPNkktMS1vR3hBRzd2cWNFdVdaVGU1WldEaUp5Z2x6bDByRHc1aHM2aGZ5ZHpRMkRBSU1qRXktZDJacTR3enFwNTAyNnlVdTQ0S2RISmpXR01aUDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Most of the recent confirmed measles cases in Texas have been in the South Plains region, but this patient was exposed to the disease while traveling overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas — Health officials say they have confirmed a case of measles in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a press briefing Friday, Austin Public Health confirmed that an unvaccinated infant was exposed to measles while traveling overseas. Everyone else in the child's family is vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials said contact tracing is complete and they don't expect additional exposures. The child and their family members are all isolated at home.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It certainly raises our level of concern, our level of readiness, but we've been ready," Austin Travis County Public Health Authority Dr. Desmar Walkes said. "We've been planning for over a year for the possibility of a measles outbreak because we've known that our vaccination rate has been declining. We've been working hard to get people vaccinated, and we're calling for people to get vaccinated now, if they're unvaccinated, to protect themselves."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes said the case is not related to an ongoing measles outbreak in the South Plains region of Texas, where &lt;a target="_blank" href="/article/news/health/measles/measles-outbreak-texas-2025-update/285-dded2ec7-e37b-42f7-8adb-2956fdb329bc"&gt;146 cases have been reported&lt;/a&gt; as of Friday, Feb. 28. Twenty of the patients have been hospitalized, and one unvaccinated child has died, marking the first &lt;a target="_blank" href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-death-outbreak-lubbock/285-636380ac-1d18-4404-999d-b804f40137af"&gt;measles death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. To give you a sense of how contagious this virus is, doctors say if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The measles virus can survive in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after the infected person has left the area," Walkes said. "People who have direct contact through coughs or sneezes should monitor for symptoms for up to 21 days after exposure."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local health officials stress that there is no local outbreak, but they say now is the time to take precautions and prepare.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR – measles-mumps-rubella – vaccine is highly effective in protecting against measles. According to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), one dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles and two doses are 97% effective against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know how to combat this, and we need that vaccination rate to increase in our community by coming together, getting vaccinated, and prioritizing public health," Travis County Judge Andy Brown said. "We can do this together. The steps are simple. Get vaccinated if you haven't already."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to state health data, Travis County's MMR vaccination rate among kindergarteners is just under 90%. Doctors say communities need 95% immunization rates to have "herd immunity."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that worries local leaders is the under 90% vaccination rate among kindergarteners at some schools, which health officials said increases the risk of an outbreak by 51%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're continuing to work with those school administrators to get vaccines in arms," Walkes said. "We've been having clinics. Our mobile team has been educating families, and we're continuing that work and that effort. It'll be ongoing until we get the job done and get the message to parents that need to hear it."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said kids as young as a year old can get their first dose of the MMR vaccine and the second when they're between four and six years old. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If everybody else had their kids vaccinated at the proper ages, this would not be an issue," Brown said. "By not vaccinating your child at the proper ages of 12 to 15 months and then again at 4 to 6 years, you're putting other infant children at risk. You're putting our community's lives at risk. You're putting our economy's life at risk."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a parent is going to an area where measles is prevalent, Walkes said the child should be vaccinated earlier, at six to eleven months. Walkes said that guidance may change if we see more cases in the Austin area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we do have an outbreak where we see more than three or more cases in our area, then we will change our guidance," Walkes said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), of the 146 cases, 98 have been reported in Gaines County, and 21 have been reported in nearby Terry County. Most of the cases have been among children. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSHS reports that 79 of the 146 patients were unvaccinated, 62 have unknown vaccination status, and five have received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is no local outbreak right now, Walkes said she and her team are prepared for the worst but are hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've been in contact with our hospital partners and clinics and folks across our jurisdiction, and they are ready and prepared and have processes in place to handle people who may contact them saying that they have symptoms of measles," Walkes said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another primary concern for local leaders is South by Southwest (SXSW) starting next weekend. As hundreds of thousands of people descend upon Downtown Austin, they don't want that to become a super spreader event. They are encouraging those in the community who aren't vaccinated to get vaccinated. The city and health department say they are working with organizers on health precautions for the event.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We work in collaboration with Austin Special Events to help them mitigate and strategize for health precautions for events," Walkes said. "Our team has been in contact with them and our business partners across the city."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking to get the vaccine can do so at doctor's offices and pharmacies. The health department offers the MMR vaccine at its "Shots for Tots" and "Big Shots" clinics. You can find information about those &lt;a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/immunizations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Children under the age of 14 do need a prescription from a doctor to get the vaccine at a pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

And then it's like, 'Oh, the right side of my body is dipping,'" she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At first, Walsh wasn't sure what was going on, especially since people kept telling her she was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"They're like, 'Oh, you're off.' I'm like 'No,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walsh also felt strange while walking her dog one day and recalled thinking the street must be "windy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It was just sort of very subtle and then very kind of, 'Oh it's ADD. I can't really focus. Oh I've been scrolling too much.' That kind of stuff," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Going through this health scare taught Walsh a lesson that she's hoping to share with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I know how important it is to advocate for one's own health because people were like, You're just depressed.' It was right after (my TV show) 'Bad Judge' got canceled. 'Your show got canceled. You're just depressed,'" she recalled others saying. "I'm like, 'No something's off.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Walsh appeared on "The Kelly Clarkson Show" on Feb. 27, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, Walsh acknowledged that it's challenging to advocate for yourself in these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It's a hard thing when you have everybody looking at you going, 'Hmm, I think you're just this or that. You're tired,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2017, Walsh &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/kate-walsh-opens-about-being-diagnosed-very-sizable-brain-tumor-t116425" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:appeared on TODAY;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;appeared on TODAY&lt;/a&gt; to discuss her diagnosis and recovery. After feeling “exhausted,” she decided to seek medical assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But I’d just wrapped a show, ‘Bad Judge,’ and I was starring in it and executive producing, so it wasn’t unheard of to be totally exhausted. So I thought I just really burned myself out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Soon enough, Walsh started experiencing cognitive symptoms and "couldn't find my words."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After fighting for a diagnostic MRI, Walsh learned that she had a “very sizable tumor.” Following a surgery, she discovered that it was benign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The non-cancerous tumor was known as a meningioma, which &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/meningioma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:John Hopkins Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;John Hopkins Medicine&lt;/a&gt; defines as "the most common type of primary brain tumor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"These tumors originate in the meninges, which are the outer three layers of tissue between the skull and the brain that cover and protect the brain just under the skull," the John Hopkins Medicine website reads.

			&lt;p&gt;When Kim Kardashian &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CvszJqGyfqr/?utm_source=ig_embed"&gt;posted on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; about having had a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/keeping-up-with-advanced-mri-kim-kardashian-promotes-whole-body-scans-could-they-be-worth-the-hype-211676"&gt;full-body MRI&lt;/a&gt;, she enthused that the test can be "life saving", detecting diseases in the earliest stages before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Kardashian neglected to say was there's no evidence this expensive scan can bring benefits for &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.26736"&gt;healthy people&lt;/a&gt;. She also didn't mention it can carry harms including &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-020-00679-4"&gt;unnecessary diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; and inappropriate treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this post in mind, we wanted to explore what influencers are telling us about medical tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published today in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, we analyzed nearly 1,000 Instagram and TikTok posts about five popular medical tests which can all do more harm than good to healthy people, including the full-body  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found the overwhelming majority of these posts were utterly misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5 controversial tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we get into the details of what we found, a bit about &lt;a href="https://www.researchprotocols.org/2024/1/e56899"&gt;the five tests&lt;/a&gt; included in our study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these tests can be valuable to some, all five carry the risk of overdiagnosis for generally healthy people. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-warning-signs-of-overdiagnosis-110895"&gt;Overdiagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is the diagnosis of a condition which would have never caused symptoms or problems. Overdiagnosis leads to overtreatment, which can cause unnecessary side effects and stress for the person, and wasted resources for the health system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, estimates suggest &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/29-000-cancers-overdiagnosed-in-australia-in-a-single-year-127791"&gt;29,000 cancers a year are overdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt; in Australia alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overdiagnosis is a global problem, and it's driven in part by healthy people having tests like these. Often, they're promoted under the guise of early screening, as a way to "take control" of your health. But most healthy people simply don't need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the five tests we looked at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;full-body MRI scan&lt;/strong&gt; claims to test for up to 500 conditions, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Yet there is no proven benefit of the scan for healthy people, and a real risk of unnecessary treatment from "&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.26736"&gt;false alarm&lt;/a&gt;" diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;"egg timer" test&lt;/strong&gt; (technically known as the AMH, or anti-mullarian hormone test) is often falsely promoted as a fertility test for healthy women. While it may be beneficial for women within a fertility clinic setting, it cannot reliably predict the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2656811"&gt;chance of a woman conceiving&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/29/3/327/6990969?login=true"&gt;menopause starting&lt;/a&gt;. However, low results can &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/0167482X.2018.1541980?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed#abstract"&gt;increase fear and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and lead to unnecessary and expensive &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29719026/"&gt;fertility treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-cancer early detection blood tests&lt;/strong&gt; are being heavily marketed as the "holy grail of cancer detection", with claims they can screen for more than 50 cancers. In reality,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are still a long way from finished. There's &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/386/bmj.q1706"&gt;no good evidence yet&lt;/a&gt; that the benefits will outweigh the harms of unnecessary cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;gut microbiome test&lt;/strong&gt; of your stool promises "wellness" via early detection of many conditions, from flatulence to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="153564" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, again &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/well/live/microbiome-test.html"&gt;without good evidence of benefit&lt;/a&gt;. There's also concern that test results can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cclm-2019-0122/html"&gt;wasted resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testosterone testing&lt;/strong&gt; in healthy men is not supported by any high-quality evidence, with concerns direct-to-consumer advertising &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2612615"&gt;leads men to get tested and take testosterone replacement therapy unnecessarily&lt;/a&gt;. Use of testosterone replacement therapy carries its own risk of potential harms with the long-term safety in relation to heart disease and mortality &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666756822000964?via%3Dihub"&gt;still largely unknown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with an international group of health researchers, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830758"&gt;we analyzed 982 posts&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to the above tests from across Instagram and TikTok. The posts we looked at came from influencers and account holders with at least 1,000 followers, some with a few million followers. In total, the creators of the posts we included had close to 200 million followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even discounting the bots, that's a massive amount of influence (and likely doesn't reflect their actual reach to non-followers too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of posts were misleading, failing to even mention the possibility of harm arising from taking one of these tests. We found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;87 percent of posts mentioned test benefits, while only 15 percent mentioned potential harms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only 6 percent of posts mentioned the risk of overdiagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only 6 percent of posts discussed any scientific evidence, while 34 percent of posts used personal stories to promote the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;68 percent of influencers and account holders had financial interests in promoting the test (for example, a partnership, collaboration, sponsorship or selling for their own profit in some way).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed medical doctors were slightly more balanced in their posts. They were more likely to mention the harms of the test, and less likely to have a strongly promotional tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As all studies do, ours had some limitations. For example, we didn't analyze comments connected to posts. These may give further insights into the information being provided about these tests, and how social media users perceive them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, our findings add to the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33470931/"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; showing misleading medical information is widespread on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153582" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153582" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine.jpg" alt="Person being prepared for a scan in an MRI machine" class="wp-image-153582 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/PersonBeingPrepardForAScanInAnMRImachine-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153582" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-in-blue-denim-jeans-lying-on-bed-f2aDTqfnqfE"&gt;National Cancer Institute/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have proposed a range of solutions including &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-we-be-inoculated-against-climate-misinformation-yes-if-we-prebunk-rather-than-debunk-215815"&gt;pre-bunking strategies&lt;/a&gt;, which means proactively educating the public about common misinformation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, solutions like these often place responsibility on the individual. And with all the information on social media to navigate, that's a big ask, even for people with adequate health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's urgently needed is stronger regulation to prevent misleading information being created and shared in the first place. This is especially important given social media platforms including Instagram are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/meta-is-abandoning-fact-checking-this-doesnt-bode-well-for-the-fight-against-misinformation-246878"&gt;moving away from fact-checking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, remember that if information about medical tests promoted by influencers sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/247362/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lead author, Australian National University PhD candidate in biological anthropology Adam Bode, defined romantic love as “a motivational state typically associated with a desire for long-term mating with a particular individual” – and one “that arose some time during the recent evolutionary history of humans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It occurs across the lifespan and is associated with distinctive cognitive, emotional, behavioural, social, genetic, neural, and endocrine activity in both sexes. Throughout much of the life course, it serves mate choice, courtship, sex, and pair-bonding functions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="384bc22e-19b0-4471-b866-500679329be9" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Men say ‘I love you’ first – but are they really more romantic than women?","elementId":"384bc22e-19b0-4471-b866-500679329be9","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/feb/18/men-say-i-love-you-first-but-are-they-really-more-romantic-than-women"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bode said that definition was “not perfect” but was “the scientifically most useful and most precise”. He plans to update it to include the age of the onset of romantic love, to note that it “doesn’t have all its features until puberty”, and that it is associated with the early stages of a romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the study, the romantic love stage can be measured through changes in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/feb/10/1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;hormones and blood neurotransmitter levels&lt;/a&gt; and is thought to last up to two years, after which it transitions to “companionate love”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In some cases it persists longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Bode said this was “the first paper to empirically show that we don’t all love the same”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“That seems pretty obvious, but science just hasn’t shown it before,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The researchers, including experts from the University of Canberra and the University of South Australia as well as ANU, used the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/jan/15/love-story-australian-researchers-becoming-world-leaders-in-the-study-of-romantic-love" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Romantic Love Survey 2022&lt;/a&gt; of 1,556 people, the world’s largest dataset of people in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This longitudinal study across 33 countries selected 809 people aged 18 to 25, who self-reported being in love. And among them, Bode’s team identified four major “clusters”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mild: &lt;/strong&gt;About one in five – 20.02% – fell into this cluster, characterised by “the lowest intensity, lowest obsessive thinking, lowest commitment, and lowest frequency of sex”. This group also had the lowest proportion of people who thought their partner was “definitely” in love with them – just 25.31% – and the lowest proportion having sex, at 82.72%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate: &lt;/strong&gt;About four in 10 – 40.91% – landed in this category, which Bode described as “fairly stock-standard” – or in the words of the journal article, “entirely unremarkable”. Those in this category were more likely to be male, and less likely to have children. This group had “relatively low intensity, relatively low obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and relatively moderate frequency of sex”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intense: &lt;/strong&gt;This category described about one in three – 29.42% – of survey respondents, who Bode described as “crazy in-love” types. They were characterised by “the highest intensity, highest obsessive thinking, highest commitment, and relatively high frequency of sex”. About six in 10 people in this group were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Libidinous: &lt;/strong&gt;About one in 10 – 9.64% – were libidinous romantic lovers, who had sex an average of 10 times a week and up to 20 times. They were characterised as “relatively high intensity, relatively high obsessive thinking, relatively high commitment, and exceptionally high frequency of sex”. This group were slightly more likely to be male, and had the highest proportion of people in a committed relationship but not living together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Bode noted other interesting associations, including that libidinous lovers were also more likely to want to smoke cigarettes, travel and spend more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The study measured the intensity of romantic love by the Passionate Love Scale (or PLS), a “robust measure of the cognitive, emotional and behavioural characteristics of romantic love” used cross-culturally, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/S0140-1971%2886%2980043-4" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;developed in 1986&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The research noted that obsessive thinking about a loved one has been recognised in theories about the understanding and mechanisms of romantic love. It cited previous research positing that obsessive thinking helps with bonding and faithfulness, that commitment plays a role in forming bonds, and that sex is a function of romantic love (the 2022 survey participants were told to define sex by “whatever they thought it meant”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The authors of the new study suggested it might “be fruitful” to further explore variables of sex, gender and sexual orientation, as well as the impact on mood of romantic love, and its effect on relationships over time. They also recommended future research focus on cultural or ethnic variations in the expression of romantic love, as well as the role of gender inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The study noted that the survey at its heart was limited to young, English speaking adults, many of them from Weird (western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic) countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Romantic love is under-researched given its importance in family and romantic relationship formation, its influence on culture, and its proposed universality and we want to help world researchers understand it,” Bode said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“These findings have implications for the evolution of romantic love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Humans may still be evolving in terms of how they express [it].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 23:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNbXBLbXA2NUlXaHBUSW4xVkVOclNmM3F3RUtQRkVKdlQxVTJtbkpxWXRxRzZUTDQ3azR2THFfSFlSZ0FWbk1FOUdjcFMyV255V1ZseUtGcS0wb1ExXzFObjl6aWRaYVBKWWxQamxndklPNklLQ3U4MklWTlV1S0t3UGZRcjdxY3dEZ3ZjTzdGbzRkRmhsRUlmNm1fWDZzeGRhOVFnY3E3R2hHV2RWdlVHR2Y4VDEzUHQ4YnJTOGVMZw</guid></item><item><title>Short-Term Junk Food Diet Reduces Brain’s Insulin Sensitivity - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE43RmJaNC1nMzlMWXBhRERQUkZkY2swNm1CUWhuMGVCSjFGWnpieWZWVTg2cDhKQjZnU1gycGdjQjEzRUJyVHlTVVJJLWdONTBPX0lkVTk1QlhUTEE5RUtzeXlKRWNFdXhWTjhLVzRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that consuming high-calorie, highly processed foods for just five days can reduce the brain’s sensitivity to insulin, a key factor in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Researchers found that even in healthy individuals, short-term unhealthy eating altered brain function, mimicking effects seen in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sing MRI scans, they observed that reduced insulin sensitivity persisted even a week after returning to a normal diet. These findings suggest that the brain adapts rapidly to dietary changes, potentially contributing to long-term weight gain and metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Brain Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Just five days of a high-calorie diet reduced brain insulin sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Insulin resistance in the brain persisted even after resuming a normal diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity Link:&lt;/strong&gt; This effect mirrors insulin resistance seen in people with obesity and diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The number of obese persons has grown significantly in recent decades, which presents significant difficulties for those who are impacted, healthcare systems, and those who provide treatment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hormone insulin plays a key role in the development of obesity. Up until recently, there have been numerous signs indicating insulin causes neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders, especially in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108002"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/02/diet-insulin-sensitivity-obesity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Unhealthy body fat distribution and chronic weight gain are linked to the brain’s sensitivity to insulin. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by the University Hospital of Tübingen, the German Center for Diabetes Research (DZD), and Helmholtz Munich offers intriguing new insights into the origins of type 2 diabetes and obesity as well as the brain’s function as a critical control center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obesity has only been officially recognized as a disease in Germany since 2020, despite the fact that it has long been known to cause a number of illnesses, including diabetes, heart attacks, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has already declared obesity to be an epidemic, affecting over one billion individuals globally and almost 16 million in Germany alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A body mass index of 30 or more is considered obese, and a poor diet and insufficient exercise are frequently cited as the causes of this chronic illness. However, the mechanisms in the body that lead to obesity and cause the disease are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Obesity and the role of insulin in the brain &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy body fat distribution and chronic weight gain are linked to the brain’s sensitivity to insulin. What specific functions does insulin perform in the brain, and how does it affect individuals of normal weight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, Prof. Dr. Stephanie Kullmann and her colleagues at the Tübingen University Hospital for Diabetology, Endocrinology, and Nephrology found the answer to this query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate for the first time that even a brief consumption of highly processed, unhealthy foods (such as chocolate bars and potato chips) causes a significant alteration in the brain of healthy individuals, which may be the initial cause of obesity and type 2 diabetes,” says Prof. Kullmann, the study’s leader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a healthy state, insulin has an appetite-suppressing effect in the brain. However, in people with obesity in particular, insulin no longer regulates eating behavior properly, resulting in insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, in our healthy study participants, the brain shows a similar decrease in sensitivity to insulin after a short-term high calorie intake as in people with obesity,” says Ms. Kullmann. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This effect can even be observed one week after returning to a balanced diet,” she adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is also deputy head of the Metabolic Neuroimaging department at the DZD partner Institute for Diabetes Research and Metabolic Diseases (IDM) of Helmholtz Munich at the University of Tübingen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Focus on the brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Dr. Andreas Birkenfeld, Medical Director of Internal Medicine IV, Director of the IDM and DZD Board Member, and the study’s final author, concludes, “We assume that the brain’s insulin response adapts to short-term changes in diet before any weight gain occurs and thus promotes the development of obesity and other secondary diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urges more research on how the brain contributes to the development of obesity and other metabolic illnesses in light of the current findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Short period with far-reaching effects&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;29 male volunteers of average weight participated in the study and were split into two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For five days in a row, the first group had to supplement their regular diet with 1500 kcal from highly processed, high-calorie snacks. The extra calories were not consumed by the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups underwent two separate examinations following an initial evaluation. One examination was conducted immediately following the five-day period, and another was conducted seven days after the first group had resumed their regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the liver’s fat content and the brain’s insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did the fat content of the liver of the first group increase significantly after five days of increased calorie intake. Surprisingly, the significantly lower insulin sensitivity in the brain compared to the control group also persisted one week after returning to a normal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This effect had previously only been observed in obese people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and obesity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8afbdbabdaa98bca2bcf5bdaef6bcbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katrin Weber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzd-ev.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Katrin Weber – DZD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01226-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A short-term, high-caloric diet has prolonged effects on brain insulin action in men&lt;/a&gt;” by Stephanie Kullmann et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short-term, high-caloric diet has prolonged effects on brain insulin action in men&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain insulin responsiveness is linked to long-term weight gain and unhealthy body fat distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that short-term overeating with calorie-rich sweet and fatty foods triggers liver fat accumulation and disrupted brain insulin action that outlasted the time-frame of its consumption in healthy weight men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, brain response to insulin can adapt to short-term changes in diet before weight gain and may facilitate the development of obesity and associated diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At least 60 people have died and more than 1,000 have been sickened in Congo’s Équateur Province by the illness, which is characterized by “fever, headache, chills, sweating, stiff neck, muscle aches, multiple joint pain and body aches, a runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea,” according to the latest &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/democratic-republic-congo-deepens-investigation-cluster-illness-and-community-deaths-equateur?country=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo&amp;amp;name=Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;W.H.O. report&lt;/a&gt;

But the day before her surgery, she received a shocking call from her doctor: A routine screening had revealed a malignant tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Two thousand things were going through my mind,” said Kaufman, an executive coach and the author of “Crushing the Cancer Curveball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She couldn’t form a coherent thought beyond: What should I do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A diagnosis of a serious illness can be overwhelming, whether it’s happening to you or someone you love.

Ask yourself: What do I need to get through the next hour? What do I need to get through this day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Writing down your thoughts can be therapeutic “and stop them from spiraling,” Dr. Snow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’re being treated at a hospital, ask if they have a social worker on staff who can share resources to help you cope with the emotional, financial and logistical needs that may arise, Alonso said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump passed it on to Kennedy, who as HHS secretary not only has the word “health” in his title but also oversees agencies such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kennedy confirmed that the federal government was “following” and “watching” the situation, and added that there already had been two fatalities plus another 20 people hospitalized for what he said was “quarantine.” He went on to say that measles outbreaks were “not unusual,” &lt;/span&gt;noting that the U.S. had 16 outbreaks last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1894806176954753125" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="soliloquy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1894806176954753125" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;soliloquy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lasted less than 60 seconds ― which, as it turns out, was more than enough time to get &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="multiple things wrong" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/rfk-jr-minimizes-measles-outbreak-in-texas/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;multiple things wrong&lt;/a&gt;. The 20 people in the hospital at the time weren’t there for quarantine, local health officials made clear afterward. They were there because they were having severe symptoms, which in many cases meant children struggling to breathe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kennedy spoke, there had been just one death, not two ― which was welcome news, to be sure, although the one death was a child. And while it’s true the U.S. had multiple outbreaks last year, that’s not really relevant context, because the CDC considers any cluster of at least three cases an “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="outbreak" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, Texas officials were reporting &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="146 documented cases" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;146 documented cases&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 90 of them in Gaines County where the outbreak started. That number is sure to keep going up, and probably not just in Texas.

Firsthand knowledge of those dangers is one reason the public not only accepted vaccines but embraced them ― something else Edwards said she saw firsthand as a researcher in the 1970s and 1980s working on the Hib (&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Haemophilus influenzae type B" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="22"&gt;Haemophilus influenzae type B&lt;/a&gt;) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, she said, parents eagerly signed up their kids for trial studies because they knew the disease could lead to hearing loss, brain damage and death. And now? Vaccination, she says, has become a victim of its own success. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have such a great product that people have just forgotten the diseases,” Edwards said. “And that is a big problem, because if people don’t understand the diseases that you’re trying to protect against, they really don’t dread them, or they don’t fear them, and they don’t really worry about them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see the effects in polling, which has documented falling enthusiasm for vaccines over the last 25 years, with a particularly dramatic drop since COVID-19. (That’s also when attitudes about vaccines developed a sharp partisan divide, with Republican voters becoming far more skeptical than their Democratic counterparts). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not coincidentally, vaccination rates have fallen too. And it is in those communities where vaccination rates have fallen most dramatically that the measles, one of the most easily communicable diseases on the planet, keeps finding a foothold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“If people don't understand the diseases that you're trying to protect against, they really don't dread them, or they don't fear them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Kathryn Edwards, Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gaines County is one of those places. Countywide more than 17% of schoolchildren received vaccine exemptions, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="public data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="23"&gt;&lt;span&gt;public data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;; in one school it’s almost 50%. And although some of the people declining vaccination cite religious objection, a bigger factor is the misinformation parents are picking up online and from high-profile influencers, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drjessicagraymd.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Jessica Gray" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.drjessicagraymd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="24"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jessica Gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a board-certified family physician in Lubbock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;There have been social media posts locally promoting hosting ‘measles parties’ to encourage natural immunity amongst their children,” Gray, who also hosts ”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.themededitpodcast.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Med Edit Podcast" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c21d99e4b04a188e96ae74" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.themededitpodcast.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="25"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Med Edit Podcast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,” told me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These “parties” are an improvised, uncontrolled way of doing the same task a vaccine does with safeguards that prevent actual illness. “As a physician with two young children of my own, and an infant who is under 12 months of age and too young to receive the MMR vaccine, the idea of having a measles party terrifies me. This is like playing roulette with your child’s health.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recent reports suggest that many parents are now rushing to get their kids vaccinated, to protect their children from what they now realize is such a real and serious threat. And that makes sense, given that the vast majority of parents really do want what is best for their kids. Those holding back on vaccines are doing so because they genuinely believe all of the misinformation in circulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;State and local officials have been doing their best to combat those myths, making a loud, consistent case for vaccination.

&lt;p&gt;Talk about a heavy dose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the bulk of news coverage is focused on &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/studies-show-ozempic-can-lower-risk-of-depression/"&gt;GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; that cause weight loss, licensed pharmacist &lt;a href="https://linktr.ee/your.fav.pharmacist?utm_source=linktree_profile_share&amp;amp;ltsid=85fd47af-8fa3-4c9a-a002-d9eba061f219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Kati Forbes&lt;/a&gt; has spotlighted six medications “that’ll low-key or high-key make you fat or make you gain weight.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most surprising is an over-the-counter drug that’s incredibly popular for allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Kati Forbes says six medications are notorious for causing weight gain. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;highwaystarz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Benadryl&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Histamine, a chemical in our immune system involved in allergic response, also decreases appetite.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, according to the &lt;a href="https://obesitymedicine.org/blog/antihistamines-and-weight-gain-obesity-medicine-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Obesity Medicine Association&lt;/a&gt;, “it makes sense an antihistamine would have the opposite effect” and can “interfere with the ‘I’m full’ signal … and lead to overeating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking to The Post, Forbes notes that first-generation antihistamines like Benadryl and cyproheptadine — which is also used as an appetite stimulant — can cause weight gain, particularly with long-term or continued usage.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Paroxetine (Paxil)&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Paroxetine (Paxil), an antidepressant, is one of the more sedating SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) used for depression, anxiety/OCD, etc.,” said Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SSRIs increase levels of the “feel-good” chemical serotonin in the brain, and Forbes calls Paxil one of the worst offenders when it comes to weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes’s insights on the relationship between antidepressants and weight gain come amid &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/antidepressant-prescriptions-increasing-young-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;growing antidepressant use&lt;/a&gt;, especially among young adults and teens.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db377.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; that about 14% of US adults take an antidepressant. The Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute (HPHCI) notes that people often stop using the drug if they experience weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several psychiatrists in major New York hospitals told &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2002/10/20/darker-side-to-the-911-wonder-pill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt; they avoid prescribing Paxil as it causes more weight gain and sexual dysfunction than similar drugs — and has the worst withdrawal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mirtazapine, known by the brand name Remeron, is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from PTSD or insomnia. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;doucefleur – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Mirtazepine&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Mirtazapine, known by the brand name Remeron, is commonly prescribed to patients suffering from PTSD or insomnia. Those with major depressive disorder may be prescribed higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We specifically try to avoid this in patients who are overweight,” explained Forbes. She noted that the same medicine is given to animals as an appetite stimulant to increase body weight. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Kocsis, a professor and psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, previously told &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/25/antidepressants-linked-to-the-obesity-epidemic-study/"&gt;The Post&lt;/a&gt; that Remeron (Mirtazapine) “is known to cause weight gain frequently because its anti-histaminic effect makes users sluggish.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@your.fav.pharmacist/video/7287798908095368479" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;related TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, Forbes recommends trazodone as a better, less appetite-amplifying substitute.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Forbes notes that second-generation antipsychotics can pump up the plump. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tiktok/@your.fav.pharmacist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Second-generation antipsychotics&lt;/h3&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459150/#:~:text=Neuroleptics%2C%20also%20known%20as%20antipsychotic,generation%20or%20%22atypical%22%20antipsychotics." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Antipsychotics&lt;/a&gt;, also known as neuroleptics, are used to treat psychosis and schizophrenia. These meds are categorized into two classes — first-generation or “typical” antipsychotics and second-generation or “atypical” antipsychotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes notes that second-generation antipsychotics, especially Zyprexa and Seroquel, can pump up the plump. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The weight gain over a year can be massive, up to 30 to 50 pounds for some patients,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Antipsychotics affect neuropeptides, the signaling molecules associated with appetite control and food intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the antipsychotic drug class, Forbes notes that weight gain is linked to antihistamine activity and serotonin 2C antagonism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have seven different types of serotonin receptors,” she said. “Specifically, 2C is where we get that side effect, the antagonism or blockade of that receptor.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Dronabinol&lt;/h3&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Dronabinol is a synthetic THC used to treat and stimulate appetite in patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting as well as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;address anorexia and weight loss in adult HIV/AIDS patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Insulin &lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Insulin pushes glucose into cells vs. the bloodstream,” Forbes expounds. “These are not to be confused with meds like Ozempic/Mounjaro/Trulicity, etc., which are not insulins but also injected and refrigerated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insulin works by aiding the cellular absorption of glucose. However, when the cells absorb too much glucose, the body converts it into fat, leading to weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Forbes, who also makes &lt;a href="https://yourfavpharmacist.myshopify.com/products/body-ody-body-butter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lip balm and body butter&lt;/a&gt;, has previously &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/17/health/pharmacist-reveals-whats-her-cold-and-flu-medicine-cabinet-must-haves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shared the essential meds&lt;/a&gt; she keeps in her medicine cabinet to combat symptoms during cold and flu season and the surprising &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/20/health/why-your-stool-softener-isnt-helping-you-poop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;way you can repurpose ineffective stool softeners. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., said the situation was “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We have measles outbreaks every year,” he added. Mr. Kennedy &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/29/us/politics/rfk-jr-anti-vax.html" title=""&gt;has also said in the past&lt;/a&gt; that immunizations against measles and some other infectious diseases are unnecessary and risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Public health experts said that while it’s true we do have measles cases in the United States every year, the latest outbreak is concerning because of its size, because a child has died and because larger outbreaks like this are becoming more frequent as vaccination rates decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“While we certainly see measles cases from time to time, it’s a rarity that we see an unfolding outbreak of this scale,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. At least 164 people have been sickened with measles so far this year.

&lt;p&gt;Cook, along with Lubbock's director of public health, Katherine Wells, said they see no end in sight for the outbreak, which now spans nine counties in Texas, many of which have low vaccination rates. "This outbreak is going to continue to grow," Wells said, declining to forecast how high the final case count could go after a reporter raised the possibility of several hundred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, 116 of the 146 cases are under the age of 18, with 46 being between the ages of 0 and 4. Only five of the 146 were vaccinated with at least one dose of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, Wells reported that the outbreak has seemed to sway some vaccine-hesitant parents to get their children vaccinated. Just yesterday in Lubbock, over 50 children came into the city's clinic for measles vaccines. Eleven of those children had vaccine exemptions, meaning their parents had previously gone through the state process to exempt their child from having to receive routine childhood vaccines to attend school. "Which is a really good sign; that means our message is getting out there," Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far in the outbreak, which erupted in late January, messaging about the disease and the importance of vaccination has exclusively come from state and local authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;a brief statement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday, which was not sent through the agency's press distribution list. It did, however, note that "vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During a cabinet meeting Wednesday, US Health Secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to a question about the outbreak, offering a variety of inaccurate information. Kennedy downplayed the outbreak, falsely claiming that "it's not unusual." But, this is an unusual year for measles in the US. As epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina noted on Bluesky, the number of US measles cases this year has already &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h"&gt;surpassed the total case counts from eight of the previous 15 years&lt;/a&gt;. And it is only February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test positivity at clinical labs is trending downward but is still high, at 24.5%. Outpatient visits for flulike illness also declined but, at 5.8%, are still well above the national baseline for the 13th straight week. States still in the very high range include Michigan, Ohio, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative hospitalization rate is at its highest level since the 2010-11 flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates that 21,000 people have died from flu this season, and the pace of flu deaths in the latest reporting week outpaced those for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve more pediatric flu deaths were reported, putting the season's total at 98. All were linked to influenza A. Of 11 subtyped strains, 8 were the 2009 H1N1 virus, 2 were H3N2, and 1 involved a coinfection with both strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;COVID continues to drop amid shifting variant landscape&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html"&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt;, emergency department (ED) visits are low with a continuing decline, and test positivity remains stable, at 4.3%, the CDC said. Wastewater levels are at the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-nationaltrend.html"&gt;moderate range&lt;/a&gt;, and though detections are declining for all regions, they are highest in the Midwest, followed by the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its latest &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt;variant tracking update&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said that, over the past 2 weeks the LP.8.1 Omicron subvariant, at 42% of detections, has now edged above the XEC subvariant, which now makes up 31% of detections. LP.8.1 is a descendant of KP.1.1.3, which is part of the JN.1 lineage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were given &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y98jjwx4no" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;72 hours to leave

described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were given &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y98jjwx4no" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;72 hours to leave last week&lt;/a&gt;, although the M23 later said it was encouraging "voluntary returns".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to," Dr Muhindo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions," Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa

Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The country's ability to respond to the disease has been hampered by the conflict, between the M23 and DR Congo's army, as well as a lack of

The infected traveler was an infant returning home to Orange County after international travel, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/measles-case-orange-county-0" target="_blank"&gt;Orange County Health Care Agency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a viral infection that spreads through the air and via droplets. It can potentially lead to serious health consequences, including death. It can spread when an infected person breaths, coughs or sneezes or by touching an infected surface, according to&lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines#:~:text=A%20measles%20outbreak%20in%20the,may%20only%20become%20more%20common." target="_blank"&gt; John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;. The infection is so contagious, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;said, you can get measles just by being in a room where the infected person has been — even up to two hours after that person has left the room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles as of Feb. 22; there are 164 cases across the U.S. in states that include Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest number of cases and the&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt; first death from the disease since 2015&lt;/a&gt; — an unvaccinated child — have occurred in rural west Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the uptick in cases is caused by an overall &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-27/as-measles-cases-mount-in-the-us-whats-the-situation-worldwide"&gt;decline in measles vaccination rates worldwide since the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The infection is so contagious that at least 95% of a community needs to be immunized to prevent it from spreading. In the U.S. most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergarten-age children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travelers and airport staff who were at Terminal B — which serves flights for Air China, Air France, All Nippon Airways, British Airways and Cathay Pacific Airways, among others — on Feb. 19 between 1 and 4 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles due to possible exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible exposure site includes specific seats on the Korean Airline flight. Potentially exposed passengers can expect to be contacted by their local health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a serious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, particularly among people who are not already protected from it,” said Muntu Davis, the Los Angeles County Health Officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx#:~:text=As%20of%20February%2022%2C%202025%2C%20three%E2%80%8B%20confirmed%20measles%20case,provisional%20and%20subject%20to%20change." target="_blank"&gt;three reported cases&lt;/a&gt; of the measles as of Feb. 22; there are 164 cases across the U.S. in states that include Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island and Texas, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-02-26/an-unvaccinated-child-has-died-in-the-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials advise that you confirm whether you’ve been vaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have not had measles in the past and have not yet received the measles vaccine, you are at risk of contracting the disease if you’ve been exposed, according to county public health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were on the flight or at the terminal where the infected traveler passed through you should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review your immunization and medical records to determine if you’re protected against measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contact and notify your healthcare provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if you are pregnant, have a weakened immune system or are unimmunized against the disease. Parents or guardians of infants who were possibly exposed should contact their pediatrician. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor yourself for symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If symptoms develop, stay home and do not enter a healthcare facility before calling first to make them aware of your exposure and symptoms. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-long-would-it-take-for-signs-of-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;How long would it take for signs of symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A person can spread the illness to others before they have symptoms, and it can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to show up after exposure,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;What are symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 14 days after exposure, your symptoms could include high fever, cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes, and rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 7 and 18 days after exposure, you may develop a rash on your face and upper neck. The rash can spread to your hands and feet over the course of three days. Health officials say the rash lasts between five and six days before fading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection can result in severe complications, including blindness, encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage), severe diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infections, trouble breathing due to pneumonia and, in some cases, death, according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles can lead to severe disease in young children and vulnerable adults,” Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for complications to occur in children under 5 and adults over the age of 30, according to public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself-against-the-measles" class="subhead"&gt;How to protect yourself against the measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the best way to protect against the measles is with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;The CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting the first dose of the MMR vaccine at ages 12 to 15 months and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 20:30:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNVlFfLU8wRmYycktVeVZUN0hoeWo4QmxiR2Z0azg2bXViR2FheW1TRkpxTDBpMmZuWGJrNldlc0lJOVo3emUwMUlWX2tIdXRZM29SWTR4U0UxdW9aSldKTGoxaVRnUnJnV1NYR2hnLWV0YU1Nc3laay1PV0Z3MUdMTzhwamdKc0U2c3BLZVlfVXFQUXU2U001ek9JR25vSXd5Y251elIyRkUtb3E1bGc2bnVUblRvR0pJVW9lZ0RJUWtwaVhGMjQtLTduWDBHWWl2MXdF</guid></item><item><title>US flu season may have reached its peak, CDC says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFAxWlA3QkZRUS1sOGNLeVRLV3RPYm9CQ09PeDBEQjdmOUoxTGIybzNIaVJPZzE3Yk0zeHRLZ2VvRkpWMjNZMmxSM0U3VGpGYmRPa3pUT2tpVVdLSmRJUm1QLTZ1eWFjaTN0aXhWYlhNUkl6THFVWUcxYXRvVdIBckFVX3lxTE15bnlpcnI2VXdUUloyVkRFdVFObXNnZy10aTFxbTdDY252bzVpVDVpMmk2RnB4X255Mnc4bFhuTFJMY0lDeFRxRzhUODh4X0QtWkNxTlc5OTJoeDg0QXROSGd0M05vTWZnRDRGY0htM2dsQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The worst flu season the United States has had in more than a decade may have reached its peak, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p3nkea00043b6mo7sz7q3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-08.html" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by the agency on Friday shows that flu activity is still elevated but has decreased for two consecutive weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p3nkea00053b6miex0qbgq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were more than 6 flu hospitalizations for every 100,000 people in the US during the week ending February 22, according to CDC data. That’s less than half as many as there were two weeks earlier, but still more than there have been at this point in the season in at least 15 years – and respiratory illness activity was high or very high in all but 11 states last week
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p3nkea00063b6mgj8arwp2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been at least 37 million illnesses, 480,000 hospitalizations and 21,000 deaths from flu so far this season, according to CDC estimates, and the agency expects several more weeks of flu activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p3nkea00073b6m1x63krln@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This was also the first season since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic that flu hospitalizations surpassed those from Covid-19. As of February 22, the cumulative rate of flu hospitalizations in the US during this respiratory virus season was nearly twice as high as the rate of Covid-19 hospitalizations, according to CDC data.

            Vaccination can help prevent against severe outcomes from flu, but vaccination rates were low this season. Only about 45% of adults and children got their flu shot this season, CDC data shows, well below the federal target of 70%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            On Thursday, the CDC published &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing that the flu vaccine was between 63% and 78% effective at preventing hospitalization among children this season and between 41% and 55% effective at preventing hospitalization among adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Given the high levels of influenza activity and severity in the United States this season, increasing influenza vaccination could reduce influenza-associated illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations and deaths,” the CDC report said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Now there are growing worries about next year’s flu vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the Food and Drug Administration — now with vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm — unexpectedly and without reason canceled a March meeting of scientists who advise the FDA on vaccine policy. A similar meeting at the Centers for Disease Control was postponed last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, the head of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, joined Morning Edition host Cathy Wurzer to talk about the implications of axing the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_timelines_for_flu_vaccines_are_tight._why_do_cancellations_of_these_march_meetings_matter%3F_"&gt;Timelines for flu vaccines are tight. Why do cancellations of these March meetings matter? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes about six months for the virus that scientists use for the vaccine to grow. It’s then available in late summer or early fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="donate-ask-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MPR News helps you turn down the noise and build shared understanding. Turn up your support for this public resource and keep trusted journalism accessible to all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like planting a garden,” Osterholm said. “If you postpone it two months, you might be in trouble when you can harvest, and if you can harvest it at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timeline is already tight to make an educated estimation on what flu strains will be a problem next year, and the virus can change between now and then. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this is our best guess and our best attempt to give us the best match for the virus circulating next winter and what’s in the vaccine,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_since_the_vaccine_is_often_grown_in_chicken_eggs%2C_could_bird_flu_affect_development%3F_"&gt;Since the vaccine is often grown in chicken eggs, could bird flu affect development? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer is no. And Osterholm said this is some good news among the bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right after 9/11, when we had so many concerns about terrorism and so forth happening, the U.S. government took extra effort, along with the vaccine manufacturers, to secure the facilities where these chickens actually lay the eggs,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eggs used by scientists are embryonated, meaning they’re fertilized and growing a fetal chicken. The chickens are raised under tight biosecurity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The buildings are airtight with special filters,” Osterholm explained. “And so we feel pretty confident that even if a H5N1 situation is occurring in the region where these egg-producing locations are at, we’re still in really good shape.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_can_the_vaccines_be_manufactured_without_fda_or_cdc_panel_guidance%3F_"&gt;Can the vaccines be manufactured without FDA or CDC panel guidance? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panels evaluate what’s been happening with the flu in the southern hemisphere. The strains circulating there typically predict what’s likely to happen in the U.S. four to five months later, according to Osterholm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And without those kind of data, we can’t do that,” he said. “It’s not just something casually done saying, ‘Ah, let’s just go with that one, OK?’ Now there really is a major effort made to come up with the closest match we can. So this timing and the meetings themselves are very, very important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_if_the_federal_government_scales_back_mass_vaccination%2C_how_could_people_still_get_shots%3F_"&gt;If the federal government scales back mass vaccination, how could people still get shots? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we are really in the worst place I’ve been in my 50-year career in terms of vaccine preventable diseases,” Osterholm said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several state governments, in line with Kennedy, are increasingly identifying as anti-vaccine. For example, the Surgeon General of Louisiana recently issued a statement saying the state department of health no longer supports vaccine campaigns for children — and for parents that want them, to seek immunizations out independently. In Texas and New Mexico, there’s a worsening outbreak of measles, which the U.S. declared eliminated back in 2000. However, dropping rates of MMR vaccines for kids are bringing the disease out of the shadows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And so there is this ever-creeping concern coming into the vaccine picture of people who are not getting vaccinated,” Osterholm continued. “We have a real battle on our hands right now in terms of helping the public understand what will happen if they’re not vaccinating their kids. What this means is this is not without a consequence. So you may think you’re making a moral choice. We're also making a choice that can end up killing your child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm also pointed out that federal governments in the past have been a leader in the discussion, calling it “unfortunate” that it’s not the present case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_can_states_continue_vaccine_programs_if_the_federal_government_stops_dispersing_shots%3F_"&gt;Can states continue vaccine programs if the federal government stops dispersing shots? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ meeting was canceled recently. When the group makes a recommendation on vaccines, it’s affirmed by the CDC and triggers a sequence of events, including covering child vaccination programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without that, you basically don’t have a mechanism for paying for these vaccines, and so it’s a much larger issue than just telling parents that this is a good thing to do,” Osterholm explained. “It also makes the wheels of public health turn.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many state and local health departments in the U.S. have immunization programs largely supported by federal dollars. Osterholm is concerned that there’ll be a mass reduction in these programs under the Trump Administration. He also expects hefty layoffs at the CDC in the coming weeks, which will directly impact local health programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The whole system right now is devolving into, frankly, a black hole,” he said. “I am incredibly, incredibly concerned that we’re going to see a major erosion in [vaccination] for children in this country over the next year or two, and it will absolutely result in major outbreaks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="h2_are_you_worried_about_pandemic_readiness%2C_should_one_occur%3F_"&gt;Are you worried about pandemic readiness, should one occur? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has to understand the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don’t know what time it is,” Osterholm warned, underlining there will be more pandemics — and they could be worse than COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are we prepared for this? Absolutely not,” he said. “We have so many lessons that should have and could have been learned from what we went through with COVID that no one really ever took the time in federal governments or organizations to really review that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I fear that we’re going to go into the next pandemic… not any better prepared,” Osterholm continued. “But more importantly, we have a public now that distrusts public health unlike any time in modern history.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MPR News</author><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNdHBwU2lTelRBODBjcG1hTUV4UXljbmJlVWE1WWtfaXBaT2VJM2FzTTV0cnJnRmNvNmZULXg0bzNxOFp6M2Jkel8xNS1UcmhySnN0NDhZU1lQRTJtMVlpblZPckFNeHJ3Rjh5WUc5dzIwbzI3RjMwQi1VR2Z5WDJBSWNPR2xLTnFQSUVFMC15U25SWklTMkFoV05nM2N4VUhQS1dWSEZoVml2VzNISzZlTjN6bw</guid></item><item><title>In Texas Measles Outbreak, Signs of a Riskier Future for Children - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE0zOG9aemVMeTRpcmtkVjFtQzFTZlJDbm1GU2RhZ19uX29YWFcwZVhQVHVtWmo3bUZoZkdqeG1BcE5xTWh2NUpXR29rTnZoMllucWlXcmJPRjNZSTZUbnE0WTNqLUwxTnRUMGRjd05DYURNa2pLcHRv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Every day, as Dr. Wendell Parkey enters his clinic in Seminole, a small city on the rural western edge of Texas, he announces his arrival to the staff with an anthem pumping loudly through speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As the song reaches a climax, he throws up an arm and strikes a pose in cowboy boots. “Y’all ready to stomp out disease?” he asks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Recently, the question has taken on a dark urgency. Seminole Memorial Hospital, where Dr. Parkey has practiced for nearly three decades, has found itself at the center of the largest measles outbreak in the United States since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Since last month, more than 140 Texas residents, most of whom live in the surrounding Gaines County, have been diagnosed and 20 have been hospitalized.

            Two long-planned vaccine meetings — one at the US Centers for Disease Control and another at the US Food and Drug Administration — have now been disrupted under the watch of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stirring questions about whether seasonal flu shots or other lifesaving vaccines will be delayed or harder to access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9dv9x000m3b6mgnj45ezk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The February meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was postponed “to accommodate public comment,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to a note&lt;/a&gt; online. The three-day meeting,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which had been scheduled for this week, was to review the safety and effectiveness of vaccines for meningococcal disease, which is seeing a resurgence, as well as RSV, flu, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/chikungunya-vaccine-cdc-investigating-hospitalizations/index.html"&gt;chikungunya&lt;/a&gt; and mpox. It also &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/agenda-2025-02-26-28-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;included two votes&lt;/a&gt; related to Vaccines for Children, the government program that buys and distributes vaccines to state and local health departments for children whose families wouldn’t otherwise be able to pay for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9g3q1000r3b6m9h2mll6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            ACIP typically meets three times a year, in February, June and October. There’s no word on whether or when the February meeting will be rescheduled and it’s unclear whether the delay will hinder access to shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o6vzxd00093b6mby8kqx71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html"&gt;FDA canceled&lt;/a&gt; a March 13 meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which was to discuss the recipe manufacturers must follow to make this fall’s flu shots. No explanation was given for the cancellation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9c0kl000g3b6m88ej5gxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a statement to CNN on Thursday, the FDA said it would still weigh in on the makeup of flu shots but didn’t indicate whether it would seek its advisers’ guidance or allow for the public discussion and debate that usually occurs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9i2up000t3b6m6cy8pdob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The FDA will make public its recommendations to manufacturers in time for updated vaccines to be available for the 2025-2026 influenza season,” the statement said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x00022e6blfkv1l3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The uncertainty around the government’s process for regulating and recommending vaccines comes as the US is in the grips of a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/health/flu-season-hospitalizations-mrsa-ane/index.html"&gt;brutal flu season&lt;/a&gt; and experiencing a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/texas-measles-death/index.html"&gt;resurgence of measles&lt;/a&gt;, a vaccine preventable disease. Experts say these infections are increasing because of growing hesitancy to use vaccines, something they fear the new HHS director will only encourage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x00032e6bfequg2s6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintains that he is not anti-vaccine, but he has repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and effectiveness of immunizations and questioned the research and regulations that allow them to be used.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9rh0r00193b6mpfw0oa50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, whose financial disclosures show he has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/politics/rfk-jr-financial-interest-wisner-baum-lawsuits/index.html"&gt;made money from law firms &lt;/a&gt;that sue vaccine manufacturers, has also impugned some of the experts who advise federal agencies on vaccines. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;incorrectly&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;stated that 97% of the members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee had conflicts of interest. In fact, the panel has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/ACIP-conflicts-interest-policy.pdf#:~:text=A%20conflict%20of%20interest%20exists%20when%20a,that%20vaccine%2C%20or%20of%20a%20competing%20vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;strict policies&lt;/a&gt; to guard against conflicts, and a screening process for members to ensure they are impartial when they vote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9e4ip000p3b6m3niaazty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Members of FDA’s vaccine committee are also subject to strict conflict of interest rules and are required to disclose potential conflicts during meetings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o9l5qv00153b6mzkhhkw33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-frieden_among-the-many-myths-circulating-about-vaccines-activity-7300602853784465408-t0Db?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAAACwoZkBElUwSIV2Ynw-2W8V_lyGmfKbibE" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that false claims that ACIP members vote based on their financial ties is among the “most damaging” falsehoods about vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7okus6400002e6bmdqbu9fj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frieden said the 97% figure comes from a 2009 report, issued when he was CDC director. He is now president and CEO of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ovctto00052e6bwvkbo7by@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was an audit of lengthy and detailed conflict of interest forms submitted by all experts who served as CDC advisers in 2007. He said 97% had at least one missing response, which could have meant someone forgot to do something as simple as initial a page. He said it is not the same thing as a conflict of interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oq2cj600002e6bi66kgqde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really think that this is classic misinformation,” Frieden told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oa48fa001j3b6mr2uzbalz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Frieden also raised alarm about the postponed ACIP meeting, writing in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tom-frieden_making-america-healthier-the-administration-activity-7298578744196141057-Bz1y/" target="_blank"&gt;a recent post on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s certain there will be misleading, inaccurate information claiming ACIP members have conflicts of interest. Here’s the plain truth: ACIP, made up of pediatricians, public health specialists, and parents, is the gold standard for open, transparent recommendations on vaccine safety and effectiveness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaj58x00253b6myoy9fi3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without either vaccine committee weighing in on vaccine regulation or recommendations, health-care providers worry there will be delays on vaccines or limits on people’s ability to access them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oannto002c3b6mp0en084w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Cancelling this meeting means vaccine makers may not have the vital information and time they need to produce and distribute targeted vaccines before the next flu season,” Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said after the cancellation of the FDA flu shot meeting. “If the FDA meeting is not immediately rescheduled, many lives that could be saved by vaccination will be lost.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oapzw4002g3b6m05q39ik4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a February 20 &lt;a href="https://www.fightinfectiousdisease.org/post/sign-on-letter-to-preserve-acip-meeting" target="_blank"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy, Acting CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and Sen. Bill Cassidy&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a doctor and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, a coalition of groups called the Partnership to Fight Infectious Disease pushed for the “prompt rescheduling” of the ACIP meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaqr8a002j3b6mr5r0ws92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Each ACIP meeting holds tremendous weight and relevance. Infectious diseases are constantly evolving opponents; vaccines are among the best tools for constantly adapting and responding to the latest public health threats,” the letter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oatn1c002m3b6m6ev1xsu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Making America healthy requires healthy discussion and timely, evidence-based decisions. This meeting should be no different.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7obgbkx00003b6m2vzyutro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several different ways to make flu vaccines, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-process/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the most common&lt;/a&gt; is to grow the selected candidate viruses in chicken eggs — a painstaking operation that takes months to finish.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7obquud00053b6miceo530q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For that reason, selection of the strains that will be included in flu vaccines is carefully orchestrated to be sure that manufacturers can deliver their shots to doctor’s offices and pharmacies in time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000h2e6bjt3hjy0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In order for flu vaccines to be sold in the US, they must contain strains that are officially selected by the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob4uk700353b6m2xice34r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That decision typically comes after a meeting of the World Health Organization’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/global-influenza-surveillance-and-response-system/who-collaboration-center-erl" target="_blank"&gt;a network of&lt;/a&gt; seven collaborating centers and four essential regulatory labs, which are based in the US, UK, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. Both the CDC and FDA are members, and representatives from both agencies participated in the deliberations which got underway this week, WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p106fn00002e6b0eadc0mj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The US did participate in this meeting,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, said at a news briefing on Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p15i5h00042e6bzagg9e08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I want to be very clear that the US is still contributing. I know that there’s a lot of attention on the US right now, but we are going to continue to emphasize the importance of this global system that’s in place.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob6bhl003b3b6m1wfoqpnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These experts meet twice a year — in the fall and spring — to choose strains for countries in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ozk1va00002e6bqx3oepz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-02-2025-recommendations-announced-for-influenza-vaccine-composition-for-the-2025-2026-northern-hemisphere-influenza-season" target="_blank"&gt;WHO announced&lt;/a&gt; the strains that it thinks will most closely match the viruses that will be making people sick next fall. Those picks would swap out the H3N2 component of this years vaccine, which was only a partial match to the circulating viruses, for a new one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7p0cyop00002e6bk7nr2ova@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think the match is not perfect, but it is a reasonable match, and is still the best preventative we have against infection with influenza,” said Prof. Ian Barr, deputy director at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, and a member of GISRS, in a new briefing after the strain selection
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000n2e6b1icp9h1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What typically happens next is that the 17-member FDA vaccine committee would meet and publicly discuss the recommendation, and then make its own endorsement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The agency ultimately makes the final decision, which can differ from its advisers’, although they generally align.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000o2e6bnmg35uqj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This year, there won’t be an advisory meeting. The FDA said it would still make recommendations to manufacturers but didn’t specify how it would come to a decision or when.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000p2e6bydwabril@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s no FDA recommended strains, the US manufacturers are kind of stuck,” said Dr. LJ Tan who is chief policy and partnerships officer for nonprofit vaccine advocacy group Immunize.org.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oaxfrs002u3b6mhjkt7n5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu vaccine manufacturers contacted by CNN on Thursday said the missed VRBPAC meeting wouldn’t break their stride.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob47e5002z3b6mv1o2ogb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just as every year, we have already begun production for the 2025-2026 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere and will be ready to support final strain selections in time for the season,” wrote Sanofi in a statement to CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ob4hh300323b6mp6w3rcb2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GSK also said it will continue to work with FDA on its flu strain recommendation in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000r2e6bsaioq01t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But canceling the VRBPAC meeting will deprive Americans of public discussion and debate that happens when these experts meet. It makes the process less transparent, Immunize.org’s Tan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000s2e6blbojg9gq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very dangerous to bypass your expert advisory committee,” Tan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7oltkbi00032e6bpr42aqat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy promised “radical transparency” at HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onjm6a00092e6br3a5wwbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Public health agencies should be transparent and if we want Americans to restore trust in the public health agencies, we need transparency,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onluyi000c2e6bstf5zl5k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine advocates say canceling advisory committee meetings undermines that goal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000u2e6bprmnc1ch@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You heard what we thought. We disagreed on some things, and for people who are interested, you can see how we arrived at the conclusion that we did,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a member of FDA’s VRBPAC who is also a pediatrician and immunologist at the University of Iowa.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7onwp14000j2e6bmwfd8smv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Perlman said he was also worried that skipping committee meetings would deprive the public of a window into the government’s vaccine decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000v2e6blxl5qrew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The country is in so much flux right now about what it thinks about vaccines, what it thinks about medical devices, what it thinks about drugs. The more transparency there is, hopefully, the more people who are undecided about things will see where the committee is coming from,” Perlman told CNN’s Meg Tirrell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000w2e6b6t6ongm8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts agreed the committees are an important layer of independent review.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000x2e6b7xpjicrn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s kind of taking experts out of the conversation,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician who directs of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “Many of these decisions are tricky and nuanced, and having the opportunity for a group of experts who are familiar with these vaccines and familiar with these diseases. You know, have an open discussion is critically important.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7nz9c2x000y2e6bz18352nq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA has not said how it will choose vaccine strains for the fall, but if it follows WHO’s recommendation, it will mean that the US will be relying on data from the organization despite President Donald Trump’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; that the US withdraw its support from WHO and stop sharing information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s part of the chaos, whether it’s planned or not, or just incompetence,” Moss said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7o74ekc00002e6bmzc82wgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study will trial the use of double immunotherapy. In some patients, double immunotherapy will be combined with chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial will be led by The Brain Cancer Centre, which has world-leading expertise in glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am delighted to be handing the baton to &lt;a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/researcher/jim-whittle/"&gt;Dr Jim Whittle&lt;/a&gt;, a leading Australian neuro-oncologist at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Co-Head of Research Strategy at The Brain Cancer Centre, to commence a broader scientific study to scientifically determine if – and how – this process might work in treating glioblastoma,” said Prof Long, who also secured drug access for the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we are buoyed by the results of this experimental treatment so far, a clinical trial in a large group of patients would need to happen before anyone could consider it a possible breakthrough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Whittle, also a laboratory head at WEHI, said: “We are pleased to be able to build on this exciting work by diving into the process of designing a clinical trial, which takes time, care and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When that process is complete, the result will be a world first clinical trial that enables us to thoroughly test the hypothesis against a representative sample of patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brain Cancer Centre was founded by Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer and established in partnership with WEHI with support from the Victorian Government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centre brings together a growing network of world-leading oncologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons, bioinformaticians and cancer biologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commencement of recruitment for the clinical trial will be announced by The Brain Cancer Centre at a later date and will be limited to eligible patients.&lt;/p&gt;
