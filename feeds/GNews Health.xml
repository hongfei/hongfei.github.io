&lt;p&gt;Recent research is revealing that the earliest stages of human development, even before birth, may hold the key to predicting &lt;strong&gt;life expectancy&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers from the &lt;strong&gt;University of Adelaide&lt;/strong&gt; suggests that the length of &lt;strong&gt;telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; at birth could be a significant marker of how long an individual may live — and how susceptible they might be to &lt;strong&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/strong&gt; as they age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Role of &lt;strong&gt;Telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Longevity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telomeres&lt;/strong&gt; are crucial components of &lt;strong&gt;chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt; that play a central role in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/scientists-reveal-newly-discovered-protein-could-be-the-secret-to-reversing-aging-%e2%8f%b3/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73951" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These &lt;strong&gt;DNA&lt;/strong&gt; structures protect the ends of chromosomes, and each time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten. Eventually, as telomeres become too short to protect chromosomes, the cell can no longer divide and dies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This process has long been linked to aging, and the length of telomeres at birth could be a critical factor in determining an individual’s &lt;strong&gt;lifespan&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/newsroom/news/list/2025/03/17/embryo-development-holds-key-to-healthy-lifestyles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Rebecca Robker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a leading researcher at the University of Adelaide, some babies are born with shorter telomeres than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shorter telomeres are observed in children of women with obesity or metabolic syndrome,” Robker explained. “As adults, these individuals are at increased risk of premature mortality from cardiovascular events, such as a heart attack or stroke, even when they are not obese themselves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight how the biological clock begins ticking before birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How &lt;strong&gt;Maternal Health&lt;/strong&gt; Impacts Telomere Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed a striking connection between the health of the &lt;strong&gt;mother&lt;/strong&gt; and the telomere length in her offspring. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Factors such as maternal &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/soda-daily-why-you-should-think-twice/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76015" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;obesity&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;or metabolic syndrome, which are known to affect a mother’s health, appear to directly impact the telomere length of the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/chicken-embryos-dinosaur-gene-switch/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83638" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;developing embryo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This means that a woman’s health prior to and during &lt;strong&gt;conception&lt;/strong&gt; can have lasting effects on the future health of her child, influencing their risk for &lt;strong&gt;chronic conditions&lt;/strong&gt; well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that maternal health and &lt;strong&gt;environmental conditions&lt;/strong&gt; during the early stages of conception play a critical role in determining telomere length. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process is highly responsive to signals from the mother’s body,” said Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Yasmyn Winstanley&lt;/strong&gt;, co-lead author of the study. “Our findings show that maternal health and environmental conditions at the time of conception can have long-term consequences and can even influence the offspring’s susceptibility versus resilience to aging-associated diseases in later life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mechanism of &lt;strong&gt;Telomere Resetting&lt;/strong&gt; in Embryos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most fascinating findings of the study is how embryos can &lt;strong&gt;reset&lt;/strong&gt; the telomeres they inherit from their parents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Shortly after &lt;strong&gt;fertilization&lt;/strong&gt;, the embryo inherits telomeres from both the egg and sperm, which may already be shortened due to the age of the parents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the embryo has a natural mechanism that extends these telomeres, essentially resetting the biological clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This reset process can be disrupted by &lt;strong&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/strong&gt;, which can shorten telomeres even further. The researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;mitochondrial health&lt;/strong&gt; plays a significant role in this process, as mitochondria are responsible for producing the energy needed for telomere extension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;By studying embryos in mice, the team discovered that when mitochondrial function was impaired, telomeres did not reset properly, leading to shorter telomeres at birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential &lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic&lt;/strong&gt; Approaches to Influence Telomere Length&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the shortening of telomeres before birth can increase the risk of chronic diseases, the researchers also discovered promising &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic possibilities&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using existing &lt;strong&gt;medications&lt;/strong&gt;, like the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/scientists-finally-crack-60-year-mystery-behind-diabetes-wonder-drug-metformin/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73996" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antidiabetic drug metformin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, it is possible to help reset and lengthen the telomeres in embryos, potentially improving their future health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor Robker&lt;/strong&gt; emphasized that “There are therapeutic opportunities to optimize this biology, which is a key determinant of chronic disease risk.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This opens up a potential avenue for interventions that could mitigate the long-term effects of shortened telomeres, offering hope for improving the health of future generations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers are continuing their work in collaboration with &lt;strong&gt;Vitaleon Pharma&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing on developing treatments that can improve telomere length through pre-conception and early embryo development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings not only offer a new perspective on the origins of aging but could also revolutionize how we approach &lt;strong&gt;reproductive medicine&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;public health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is the key component of weight loss and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-benefits-and-risks-revealed-in-new-study"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and Wegovy, and an international team of researchers has now discovered it can also do wonders for people who have developed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-estimates-millions-in-us-risk-liver-damage-from-herbal-remedies"&gt;liver disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/drug-development-process/step-3-clinical-research"&gt;phase 3 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving 800 participants and lasting 72 weeks, a weekly dose of semaglutide was effective in almost two-thirds of patients at treating a serious form of fatty liver disease known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_dysfunction%E2%80%93associated_steatotic_liver_disease"&gt;Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis&lt;/a&gt; (MASH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results from this landmark study across 37 countries provide strong evidence that semaglutide can help patients with MASH by not only improving liver health, but also addressing the underlying metabolic issues that contribute to the disease," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Arun Sanyal, a professor of medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159960" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart.jpg" alt="Liver treatment chart" class="wp-image-159960 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/LiverChart-600x276.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159960" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The treatment had benefits for reducing inflammation and scarring. (Sanyal et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were split into two groups. Of those given the semaglutide treatment, 62.9 percent saw improvements in their MASH, compared to 34.3 percent of the group given a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; treatment instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, liver fibrosis (scarring) – which happens as the liver tries to repair damage – was reduced in 36.8 percent of patients given the semaglutide treatment, compared to 22.4 percent of patients given placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvements in both MASH and fibrosis were seen in 32.7 percent of the participants on semaglutide, compared to 16.1 percent of the placebo group. It's a comprehensive win for the drug, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drug-semaglutide-shows-promise-as-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;showing potential&lt;/a&gt; in many different areas of health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That placebo effect is fairly typical, by the way, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/incredible-placebo-study-shows-fake-pills-can-reduce-stress"&gt;often happens in trials&lt;/a&gt;: it's thought to be a combination of the psychological boost of thinking you're being treated, plus a tendency to live more healthily and carefully if you know you're part of a study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If approved, this could offer an additional therapeutic option for patients with MASH and fibrosis," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sanyal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is crucial, given the strong link between MASH and cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal conditions, where semaglutide has already shown established health benefits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is a GLP-1 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt;) receptor agonist, essentially acting like the natural GLP-1 hormone to help regulate key metabolic processes – including reducing appetite and lowering blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes it effective for treating obesity and diabetes, but this boost in biological regulation seems to have plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/not-just-weight-loss-8-conditions-drugs-like-wegovy-might-treat"&gt;other benefits too&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to liver disease, the thinking is that the metabolism and anti-inflammatory improvements triggered by the drug help to treat some of the key drivers of MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="159957" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; is continuing, expanding to a larger group of people for a full five years to see if these initial improvements continue. With only one approved treatment available for MASH, new options are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By treating both liver disease and its metabolic causes, semaglutide offers a promising new approach for millions of patients," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/vcu-led-research-highlights-semaglutides-potential-for-treating-fatty-liver-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sanyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2413258"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is facing its worst measles outbreaks in years with &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-02/robert-f-kennedy-jr-revives-measles-vaccine-claims/105242968"&gt;nearly 900 cases&lt;/a&gt; across the country and active outbreaks in several states. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Kennedy, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, continues to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/wtf-rfk-jr-even-talking-133618630.html"&gt;erode trust in vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we make of his latest claims?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;There’s no fetal debris in the MMR vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said “aborted fetus debris” in MMR vaccines is the reason many religious people refuse vaccination. He referred specifically to the Mennonites in Texas, a deeply religious community, who have been &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-02/robert-f-kennedy-jr-revives-measles-vaccine-claims/105242968"&gt;among the hardest hit&lt;/a&gt; by the current measles outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many vaccines work by using a small amount of an attenuated (weakened) form of a virus, or in the case of the MMR vaccine, attenuated forms of the viruses that cause measles, mumps and rubella. This gives the immune system a safe opportunity to learn how to recognise and respond to these viruses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, if a person is later exposed to the actual infection, their immune system can react swiftly and effectively, preventing serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s claim about fetal debris specifically refers to the rubella component of the MMR vaccine. The rubella virus is generally grown in a human cell line &lt;a href="https://historyofvaccines.org/vaccines-101/how-are-vaccines-made/human-cell-strains-vaccine-development"&gt;known as WI-38&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally derived from lung tissue of a single elective abortion in the 1960s. This cell line has been used for decades, and no new fetal tissue has been used since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues"&gt;vaccines for other diseases&lt;/a&gt;, such as chickenpox, hepatitis A and rabies, have also been made by growing the viruses in fetal cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cells are used not because of their origin, but because they provide a stable, safe and reliable environment for growing the attenuated virus. They serve only as a growth medium for the virus and they are not part of the final product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think of the cells as virus-producing factories. Once the virus is grown, it’s extracted and purified as part of a rigorous process to meet strict safety and quality standards. What remains in the final vaccine is the virus itself and stabilising agents, but not human cells, nor fetal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So claims about “fetal debris” in the vaccine are false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting the world’s major religions &lt;a href="https://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2022-12/Vaccine%20componenets%20fact%20sheet%20December%202022.pdf"&gt;permit the use of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; developed from cells originally derived from fetal tissue when there are no alternative products available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The US is currently grappling with measles outbreaks.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Annie Rice/EPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Are there fragments of DNA in the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy claimed the Mennonites’ reluctance to vaccinate stems from “religious objections” to what he described as “a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles” in the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter claim, about the vaccine containing DNA particles, is technically true. Trace amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/sites/default/files/vaccine-education-center-dna-fetal-cells-vaccines.pdf"&gt;DNA fragments&lt;/a&gt; from the human cell lines used to produce the rubella component of the MMR vaccine may remain even after purification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with this claim, there’s an implication these fragments pose a health risk. This is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any DNA that may be present in this vaccine exists in extremely small amounts, is highly fragmented and degraded, and is biologically inert – that is, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/sites/default/files/vaccine-education-center-dna-fetal-cells-vaccines.pdf"&gt;it cannot cause harm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if, hypothetically, intact DNA were present in the vaccine (which it’s not), it would not have the capacity to cause harm. One common (but unfounded) concern is that foreign DNA could integrate with a person’s own DNA, and alter their genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing DNA into human cells in a way that leads to integration is very difficult. Even when scientists are deliberately trying to do this, for example, &lt;a href="https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/genetherapy/challenges/"&gt;in gene therapy&lt;/a&gt;, it requires precise tools, special viral delivery systems and controlled conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to remember our bodies are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4348004/"&gt;exposed to foreign DNA&lt;/a&gt; constantly, through food, bacteria and even our own microbiome. Our immune system routinely digests and disposes of this material without incorporating it into our genome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="Tweet" data-react-props='{"tweetId":"1906629553373458844"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question has been extensively studied over decades. Multiple health authorities, including Australia’s &lt;a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/news/media-releases/addressing-misinformation-about-excessive-dna-mrna-vaccines"&gt;Therapeutic Goods Administration&lt;/a&gt;, have addressed the misinformation regarding perceived harm from residual DNA in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the idea that fragmented DNA in a vaccine could cause genetic harm is false.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what Kennedy would have you believe, there’s no fetal debris in the MMR vaccine, and the trace amounts of DNA fragments that may remain pose no health risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the evidence does show, however, is that vaccines like the MMR vaccine offer excellent protection against deadly and preventable diseases, and have saved &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/154-million-lives-saved-in-50-years-5-charts-on-the-global-success-of-vaccines-229707"&gt;millions of lives&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

            Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, is asking the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for an agencywide “scientific process” on treating measles and other conditions with medications as well as alternative therapies such as vitamins, HHS said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pat00083b6mxu23pykm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS statement notes that “the CDC continues to recommend measles vaccination as the most effective way to prevent the disease,” and Kennedy himself &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas"&gt;has publicly encouraged&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination – while saying it’s a “personal” choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau00093b6mbpzod70s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, “we recognize that some individuals and communities across the U.S. may choose not to vaccinate,” the HHS statement says. “Our commitment is to support all families – regardless of their vaccination status – in reducing the risk of hospitalization, serious complications, and death from measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000a3b6mlww0rdlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Secretary Kennedy will be enlisting the entire agency to activate a scientific process to treat a host of diseases, including measles, with single or multiple existing drugs in combination with vitamins and other modalities,” the statement says. “This effort will involve collaboration with universities nationwide to develop protocols, conduct testing, and pursue approval for new uses of safe and effective therapeutics that meet the highest scientific standards.”

            As a measles outbreak centered in West Texas continues to grow, reaching nearly 800 cases as of this week, disease experts fear that Kennedy’s continuing emphasis on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment/index.html"&gt;unconventional therapies&lt;/a&gt; such as cod liver oil, the antibiotic clarithromycin and the steroid budesonide might take away from efforts to boost vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000c3b6mp7g2nilh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve got doctors now in these communities that are teaching other doctors how to treat this disease with aerosolized steroids, with budesonide, with clarithromycin and others,” Kennedy said Monday at a town hall event hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000d3b6m0eec841a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after the recommended two doses, but there is no specific treatment for measles once someone is infected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000e3b6mphmmg2jl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;also recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/media/pdfs/2025/05/HCP_Caring-for-Patients-with-Measles_Fact-Sheet_FINAL_3.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;measles treatment overview&lt;/a&gt; posted Thursday, the CDC says that “vitamin A may be used under the supervision of a healthcare provider” and that “other therapies, such as antibiotics should be prescribed based on clinical judgement by an individual healthcare provider.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000g3b6mpc8m6pyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The overview also notes that although there’s no evidence to support routine use of antibiotics in someone with measles, they may be necessary if the person develops a secondary bacterial infection. Likewise, it says that patients with a history of certain airway conditions may be given inhaled steroids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/health/measles-misinformation-kff/index.html"&gt;A poll&lt;/a&gt; released last week showed that a growing share of adults in the US have heard false claims about measles and the vaccine, including that vitamin A can prevent infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s really important not to conflate what … [is] supportive or adjunctive care for measles versus curative treatment for measles,” Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland, told CNN in March.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma652pau000j3b6mgnv7hwoy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/" target="_blank"&gt;a fact-check&lt;/a&gt; on its website, the American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes that “Recent claims that budesonide and clarithromycin cure measles are reckless and put children at serious risk. There is no cure for measles. Immunization is the only way to prevent the spread of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The common cold sore  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, which is often caught in childhood, usually stays in the body for life – quietly &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;dormant&lt;/a&gt; in the nerves. Now and then, things like stress, illness or injury can trigger it, bringing on a cold sore in some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this same virus – called herpes simplex virus type 1 – may also play an important role in something far more serious:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 30 years ago, my colleagues and I made a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;surprising discovery&lt;/a&gt;. We found that this cold sore virus can be present in the brains of older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155366" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore.jpg" alt="Cold Sore" class="size-full wp-image-155366" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore-597x415.jpg 597w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/ColdSore-600x417.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155366" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Herpes simplex virus type 1 hides out in our body from childhood – occasionally erupting as cold sores. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_sore#/media/File:Herpes(PHIL_1573_lores).jpg"&gt;Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first clear sign that a virus could be quietly living in the brain, which was long thought to be completely germ-free – protected by the so-called "blood-brain barrier".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we discovered something even more striking. People who have a certain version of a gene (called APOE-e4) that increases their risk of Alzheimer's, and who have been infected with this virus, have a risk that is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(96)10149-5/abstract"&gt;many times greater&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate further, we studied brain cells that we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394007010786?via%3Dihub"&gt;infected with the virus&lt;/a&gt;. They produced the same abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau) found in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid clumps on neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that the virus stays mainly dormant in the body for years – possibly decades. But later in life, as the immune system gets weaker, it can enter the brain and reactivate there. When it does, it will damage brain cells and trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, repeated flare-ups could gradually cause the kind of damage that leads to Alzheimer's in some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later found the virus's DNA &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18973185/"&gt;inside the sticky clumps of these proteins&lt;/a&gt;, which are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Even more encouragingly, antiviral treatments reduced this damage in the lab, suggesting that drugs might one day help to slow or even prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39956964/"&gt;Large population studies&lt;/a&gt; by others found that severe infections, specifically with the cold sore virus, was a strong predictor of Alzheimer's, and that specific antiviral treatment &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34136638/"&gt;reduced the risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research didn't stop there. We &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/JAD-220287"&gt;wondered if&lt;/a&gt; other  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="159978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; that lie dormant in the body might have similar effects – such as the one responsible for chickenpox and shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_83894" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-83894" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-642x260.jpg" alt="Varicella zoster virus" class="wp-image-83894 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/12/VSVirus-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-83894" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Transmission electron microscope image of the varicella zoster virus. (Science Photo Library - HEATHER DAVIES/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Shingles vaccine offers another clue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we studied health records from hundreds of thousands of people in the UK, we saw something interesting. People who had shingles had only a slightly higher risk of developing dementia. Yet those who had the shingles vaccine were &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34625411/"&gt;less likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop dementia at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833335"&gt;new Stanford University-led study&lt;/a&gt; gave similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This supported our long-held proposal that preventing common infections could lower the risk of Alzheimer's. Consistently, studies by others showed that infections were indeed a risk and that some other vaccines were protective against Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scisignal.ado6430"&gt;then explored&lt;/a&gt; how risk factors for Alzheimer's such as infections and head injuries could trigger the hidden virus in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an advanced 3D model of the brain with a dormant herpes infection, we found that when we introduced other infections or simulated a brain injury, the cold sore virus reactivated and caused damage similar to that seen in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we used a treatment to reduce inflammation, the virus stayed inactive, and the damage didn't happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this suggests that the virus that causes cold sores could be an important contributor to Alzheimer's, especially in people with certain genetic risk factors. It also opens the door to possible new ways of preventing the disease, such as vaccines or antiviral treatments that stop the virus from waking up and harming the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a link between cold sores and memory loss has grown into a much bigger story – one that may help us understand, and eventually reduce, the risk of one of the most feared diseases of our time.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254656/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A young kollel wife in Yerushalayim, the daughter of a close talmid chacham friend, recently experienced a harrowing medical ordeal that nearly cost her life rachmana litzlan. Her story serves as an urgent warning about a medication commonly used in Eretz Yisroel but banned in the United States and many other countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This young American woman, living in Yerushalayim while her husband learns in kollel, was expecting her second child. After 33 grueling hours of labor at Hadassah Har Hatzofim Hospital, she required an emergency C-section when the fetal heart rate disappeared. Baruch Hashem, the baby was born healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the surgery, the hospital administered Optalgin (Metamizole) for pain management. This seems to be standard practice in Eretz Yisroel hospitals. This routine pain medication would soon prove to be the source of a life-threatening condition for my friend’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately one week after the birth, the new mother began experiencing severe pain. Upon returning to the hospital, doctors noted her white blood cell count was extremely low but dismissed it as a laboratory error. As days passed, her condition deteriorated dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the following Wednesday, her white blood cell count had plummeted to zero. She had no neutrophils – the white blood cells responsible for fighting infection. A normal neutrophil count ranges between 2,500 and 7,000 per microliter of blood. Without these critical cells, she was at extreme risk for infection, a condition known as agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple hospital admissions, injections to stimulate neutrophil production, and treatment with five different antibiotics, her condition remained critical. Eventually, she was transferred to the hematology ward, where, boruch Hashem, specialists identified the likely cause of her condition: an adverse reaction to Optalgin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Culprit: Optalgin (Metamizole)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metamizole, marketed in Eretz Yisroel as Optalgin by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is a common over-the-counter painkiller in Eretz Yisroel. It was first produced commercially in Germany in 1922 and was once available worldwide. However, after discovering its potential to cause agranulocytosis, approximately 30 countries – including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and most European Union nations – have banned or severely restricted its use.  Thirteen years ago, Israel’s Health Ministry, after a discussion by a panel of experts, decided not to prohibit the use of over-the-counter painkiller Optalgin or to make it a prescription drug, despite 4 serious cases that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA banned Metamizole in 1977 due to its potential to induce agranulocytosis, a potentially fatal condition with a mortality rate of approximately 24 percent of those who get the condition. Despite these international restrictions, the medication remains readily available over the counter in Eretz Yisroel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the hematologist who treated this young woman, foreign citizens who have never previously taken Optalgin may be particularly susceptible to this severe reaction. A European Medicines Agency report from December 2018 also suggests that genetic characteristics of certain populations may influence susceptibility to Optalgin-induced agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of hospitalization, specialized treatment, and extensive medical intervention, the kollel wife’s white blood cell count finally rebounded, boruch Hashem. By the time she returned home, her newborn was six weeks old, and she had been separated from her toddler for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this ordeal, the young family experienced tremendous chessed from their community, with neighbors caring for their toddler and providing support – Mi k’amcha YEretz Yisroel!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case highlights the importance of being an informed and proactive patient, especially when receiving medical care in a foreign country. It is this author’s belief that the Mitzvah of v’nishmartem me’od is fullfilled when patients: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1] Ask about all medications being administered, whether orally or intravenously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2] Research unfamiliar medications, particularly those unavailable in their home country&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3] Request alternative treatments if uncomfortable with prescribed medications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk does appear to be higher with prolonged use and in women, though serious reactions can occur even after limited exposure.  Reactions are rare, but keep in mind that &lt;strong&gt;the FDA did ban it,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative pain relievers include acetaminophen (Tylenol/Acamol) and ibuprofen (Advil/Nurofen), though each carries its own risk profile. Ibuprofen has a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding with regular use, though with a much lower fatality rate than Optalgin-induced agranulocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Yidden from America and other countries continue to visit and settle in Eretz Yisroel, awareness of medications like Optalgin becomes increasingly important. What is routine medical practice in one country may carry unforeseen risks for visitors from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of this young kollel wife serves as a powerful reminder that patients and parents (or children of older parents) must be vigilant about their medical care always. &lt;/p&gt;

Seshamani said millions in federal grants were rescinded for this year and 2026 and could have been used for a variety of public health services — from vaccination clinics at the local level to work at the state lab and educational campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;MyIR cost about $293,000 a year to maintain. Seshamani declined to say&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;what else has been or might be cut due to the funding cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Visitors to the MyIR site Thursday found a confounding message: “The MyIR connection to Maryland immunization records is unavailable at this time (beginning May 1, 2025).” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Health information portals like MyIR, which stands for “my immunization records,” became popular during the coronavirus pandemic by people who needed to show they had gotten their COVID-19 shots. The portal consolidated records from doctors’ offices, drug stores and other vaccination sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;It has been used by thousands of people in Maryland every month since its inception in 2018, including by parents who need to prove their children were properly vaccinated for camp or school. And now, &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/measles-texas-outbreak-maryland-PZBQKDHXGFCUHDP4LGUTC5QEO4/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/public-health/measles-texas-outbreak-maryland-PZBQKDHXGFCUHDP4LGUTC5QEO4/"&gt;amid a national measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, it might have been used by families looking to ensure they are on schedule for the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The site has 600,000 users in Maryland, according to a memo sent April 30 to local health departments from the state health department. The notice, a copy of which was obtained by The Baltimore Banner, alerted them that the consumer site would go offline the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Seshamani did not explain why no advance public notice was given, but said decisions are being made on an ongoing basis. Users of the site were directed to get records from their health care provider or complete the Maryland &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/oideor/immun/pages/rrf.aspx" target="_self" rel="" title="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/oideor/immun/pages/rrf.aspx"&gt;ImmuNet Record Request Form&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The MyIR site notes that processing times for ImmuNet record requests may take up to 21 business days or longer, depending on request volume. The state has not typically charged consumers for access to immunization records, though doctors’ offices sometimes require a fee to fill out forms required by schools or camps that include vaccine histories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The state health department held the contract with MyIR’s operator STCHealth, an Arizona-based software company that operates the site for about a half-dozen states. Access in those other states appears to be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;A spokesman for STCHealth didn’t immediately offer a comment about the canceled contract, but said the number of users appeared accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__inline-ad"&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__ad__text"&gt;The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. &lt;a href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/advertising/"&gt;Become one.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image__container image--float-right"&gt;&lt;img src="//www.thebaltimorebanner.com/resizer/v2/EMYIN2F3LVFJTCB6Z4UKMMM3IA.jpg?auth=b683cf1ce323b0a5cf223ab58f231fc8e268e04e1aca092d1d7e10ca0404f5b9&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;height=683&amp;amp;smart=true" alt="A screenshot of the MyIR web portal on Thursday, May 1, 2025, shows the site is offline." class="image "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="image__caption "&gt;A screenshot of the MyIR web portal on Thursday shows the site is offline. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“We will be sending email notices to all registered users and are working with the vendor to update the MyIR website with appropriate information,” the state wrote in its message to local health departments on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“We recognize that the discontinuation of MyIR will cause an increased workload on staff who will now have to provide immunization documentation for the public,” including staff at doctor offices, local health departments and the state health department, the notice said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Funding has been provided to states for years by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommended the states implement such a system by 2009.

Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary, has criticized vaccine safety and effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;That concerns Seshamani, who said that she wanted to preserve more front-line public health needs in exchange for ending&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the MyIR service. She added&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that immunization records will still be available through doctors’ offices and the states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;“We will continue to evaluate what we need to do to navigate these headwinds,” Seshami said. “The priority is to mitigate any damage and protect access to care for people in Maryland.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Baltimore Banner</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 00:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxQSU8yeFVDUGZOSjUxSk91SUxxNEZ6cXZsVEd2Y0JYVjZObHp5UFhzUWNPcjRGVnlha0pQb00yZFVraFpyZldHM0xCVVNGN2xuWFlnbUM0MUxkRHAtOWo4dnZadFJFd2hleVM0RTI3dXY5UEFuYlhJWU9QWERzZ0YxeHRFN2lGVklnRWxHdXFrb1pBMl9fMkswOVRnTmJ1SVY3eUpfbUdIa1A4SGNuU3JsMzZlQXlid2RJTWlQSw</guid></item><item><title>专家说， RFK Jr.的最新疫苗计划威胁着注射的未来- Axios | RFK Jr.'s latest vaccine plan threatens future of shots, experts say - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFA4cThoZWEySUQwRkR3MEpTT25IeFJTODN3YUJYNndBNWltY2tJMjdFYVIydlA1RWFQNktfX1loNGdoUGhmVVRxOW9wV2JRTjZ2b1hOQ214aW5rZm5TYTk4cEgwd1V1cVNLdXJHY3RhdVhLS3RPVXdLcQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 02 May 2025 00:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFA4cThoZWEySUQwRkR3MEpTT25IeFJTODN3YUJYNndBNWltY2tJMjdFYVIydlA1RWFQNktfX1loNGdoUGhmVVRxOW9wV2JRTjZ2b1hOQ214aW5rZm5TYTk4cEgwd1V1cVNLdXJHY3RhdVhLS3RPVXdLcQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚发现了咖啡的新健康益处- AOL.com | Scientists Just Discovered a New Health Benefit of Coffee - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxQN0RLb2xrY1BmT3d3RU8yMUhUa0FDS0lKc05iUkotMkI3bGstY3BRUHoxMThTNmw0dk1vNWZ1X3IwNkdDU2JlWk11cEJnS0N4VTNFYWd0U19SZjFPSnI0ODVTQ1dPQllLRkdOZXZNWVgzRm9CMWRnc3REMm1OTWgwX0N3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Annie Nguyen, M.A., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty Images.

Interestingly, coffee doesn’t just provide a morning pick-me-up! Studies suggest it may also benefit our health in various ways. For instance, research has shown that drinking more coffee is linked to a reduced &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-weight-loss-meal-plan-for-better-blood-sugar-8739376" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of developing type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of developing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of whether it’s caffeinated or decaffeinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is rich in compounds like caffeine and polyphenols that may support better insulin function and fight inflammation. But not all coffee is created equal. Flavored drinks, coffeehouse treats and instant coffee mixes often include added sugar and saturated fat, which might negate some of those health benefits. That’s why we must take the type of coffee and its preparation under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drinking coffee might be connected;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drinking coffee might be connected&lt;/a&gt; to blood sugar levels and other related health markers in Korean adults, researchers looked at factors like fasting glucose, insulin levels, long-term blood sugar (HbA1c) and measures of insulin resistance and insulin production among those who drank different coffee drinks, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ultra-processed-food-psoriasis-study-11725143" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientists Just Discovered a Surprising Health Risk of Ultra-Processed Foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Scientists Just Discovered a Surprising Health Risk of Ultra-Processed Foods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was The Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted this study using data collected from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) between 2019 and 2021. Out of 22,559 people surveyed during this period, the researchers included 7,453 participants for their main analysis. For a specific analysis comparing coffee types, they excluded additional participants who consumed coffee in ways they could not analyze accurately, leaving them with 6,613 participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at coffee consumption by asking people what they ate and drank over a 24-hour period. They then categorized coffee into two types: black coffee versus coffee with sugar and/or cream. The researchers then grouped participants by how much coffee they drank into non-drinkers, up to 1 cup/day, 2 cups/day and 3 or more cups/day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General characteristics of the participants, such as their lifestyle habits and demographics, were assessed, and they compared different characteristics across coffee drinking habits using appropriate statistical tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study how coffee affects markers linked to blood sugar control, the researchers used a statistical model that adjusts for several factors like age, gender, diet quality, physical activity and income. These adjustments help ensure the results are not skewed by other variables. Additionally, they examined if factors like sex or age influenced coffee’s effects and conducted separate analyses where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-lower-chronic-inflammation-study-11725947" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2 Foods You Should Eat More of to Lower Inflammation, According to a New Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2 Foods You Should Eat More of to Lower Inflammation, According to a New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did The Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After conducting analyses, the researchers found that drinking 2 cups of coffee each day appeared to be linked with slightly better glucose metabolism compared to no coffee at all. Specifically, this was seen in lower levels of markers like HOMA-IR (insulin resistance) and fasting insulin, which are related to insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When breaking it down further, drinking up to 1 cup of black coffee daily was significantly associated with better glucose metabolism. However, coffee with sugar or cream didn’t show any clear benefits for these markers. This suggests that plain black coffee might have some positive effects on how the body processes sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed differences between men and women. For women, drinking two or more cups of coffee daily, especially black coffee, was associated with healthier levels of health markers related to blood sugar regulation, meaning their blood sugar and insulin levels seemed better controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, women who drank two or more cups of coffee had lower odds of issues with insulin resistance and elevated fasting insulin compared to those who didn’t drink coffee at all. The associations were stronger with black coffee, suggesting it might have unique health benefits. However, in men or individuals who added sugar or cream to their coffee, these benefits were not observed. This indicates that the way coffee is consumed and individual differences, like sex, may play an important role in its potential effects on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drinks-per-week-increase-dementia-risk-11715884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Many Drinks per Week May Raise Your Risk of Brain Damage by 133%, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Many Drinks per Week May Raise Your Risk of Brain Damage by 133%, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also observed a noticeable pattern where higher coffee intake seemed linked to better glucose metabolism in older adults. However, these results should be interpreted carefully, especially given the unique health factors that often apply to older populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study comes with some limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, we cannot determine cause and effect. However, removing participants who had diseases or were on special diets for health conditions helps reduce the chance of reverse causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is important to note that there were trends when assessing the qualities of certain groups of participants. For example, heavy coffee drinkers tended to have a higher BMI, more education, eat more calories daily, exercise less and sleep fewer hours. Many of them were also current smokers. These factors may impact overall health, including blood glucose control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also couldn’t account for different types of coffee, like decaf, or other caffeine sources such as tea or energy drinks, which may impact the results. Finally, coffee habits were measured only once, not allowing for changes in habits that may impact outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-coffee-makers-8415084" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 7 Best Coffee Makers on the Market, Tested and Reviewed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 7 Best Coffee Makers on the Market, Tested and Reviewed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this study, if you are a coffee lover, considering how you take it might make a difference. Love a good caramel latte or extra-sweet frappuccino? Well, here’s some food (or should we say, drink) for thought. Opting for black coffee or dialing back on the sugar and cream might not just save you a few calories; it could actually help regulate your blood sugar levels, particularly for women and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple adjustments like reducing sweeteners or creamers in your cup might not only enhance the health benefits highlighted by the study but also align with broader dietary goals such as maintaining a balanced blood sugar level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these findings remind us of the importance of personalized health choices. Coffee consumption isn't a one-size-fits-all matter—it may have varying effects based on factors like age, gender and individual health profiles. Reflecting on how these variables apply to your own habits could help you make informed decisions about your daily coffee intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By staying mindful of preparation methods and moderating consumption where necessary, coffee can remain an enjoyable part of your routine while potentially contributing to improved metabolic wellness. Unfortunately, this study did not address whether using sugar substitutes impacts the evaluated outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-mistake-everyone-makes-when-brewing-coffee-11702869" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Top 3 Mistakes Everyone Makes When Brewing Coffee at Home, According to Coffee Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Top 3 Mistakes Everyone Makes When Brewing Coffee at Home, According to Coffee Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee remains a beloved beverage enjoyed by millions worldwide, but as this new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights, the way we choose to consume it may impact its health benefits. If you are focused on supporting better glucose metabolism, opting for plain black coffee may be your best bet. Women and older adults in particular may find greater benefits, as suggested by the study, though individual health considerations should always guide dietary decisions. Moderation and mindful consumption are key takeaways, especially when it comes to avoiding additives like sugar and cream that may diminish coffee's positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of tailoring coffee habits to align with personal health goals. While the study provides compelling evidence of potential links between coffee and improved sugar metabolism, it also reminds us that there is no universal solution. Factors such as lifestyle, individual metabolic needs and even cultural habits play a significant role in determining the overall impact of coffee on health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/coffee-grinders-best-coffee-amazon-11710849" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Mistake You’re Making When Brewing Coffee at Home, and How to Fix It;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The #1 Mistake You’re Making When Brewing Coffee at Home, and How to Fix It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-health-benefit-of-coffee-study-11726744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:37:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQN0RLb2xrY1BmT3d3RU8yMUhUa0FDS0lKc05iUkotMkI3bGstY3BRUHoxMThTNmw0dk1vNWZ1X3IwNkdDU2JlWk11cEJnS0N4VTNFYWd0U19SZjFPSnI0ODVTQ1dPQllLRkdOZXZNWVgzRm9CMWRnc3REMm1OTWgwX0N3</guid></item><item><title>“我得了癌症，”抖音明星说。然后是仇恨的洪流。-《纽约时报》 | ‘I Have Cancer,’ the TikTok Star Said.

She modeled clothing and posed in bikinis on the beach. She gallivanted around Europe with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Within a year, she was an influencer in full, with more than 450,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But her content took a sharp turn in August 2023. In a pink bikini top, her face stained with tears, she spoke directly to the camera. “I have cancer,” she said. “I am strong, so I’ll be good.” She flashed a thumbs-up and an awkward smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Her diagnosis, she said, was cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive cancer of the bile ducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Towle’s social media posts grew more frequent and personal, as she joined the ranks of influencers in what is known as CancerTok. She made videos of herself exploring New York City, where she said she had moved to be close to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; struggling with exhaustion and nausea she attributed to chemotherapy; and crying in grief for the carefree life she no longer led. And her growing online fan base — before long, she had more than 760,000 followers — routinely cheered her on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We are all rooting hard for you girl!!!” one person posted on TikTok. “Keep up the good fight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Your positive outlook through all of this inspires me daily,” another said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But on Reddit, in a more skeptical and caustic corner of the internet, an army of angry critics was assembling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 23:29:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNeHZmNmtWLTZzNmwxTDRseHRQY1N5S3JHa0R4TF9GTVdXN0U2M0xUY1I0b2trQm9ZV04yQkVDSTZPVmpNZU04WXNnUkt4a0JqVHRwMW9NWS02MDRLOEwwZUpvZm9UaUhtdklWWVJyaWNQOGIyYW5RUGw1NHp3b3hsam1YSWdyQkp5X2c</guid></item><item><title>根据皮肤科医生的说法，最好的无毒防晒霜- Vogue | The Best Non-Toxic Sunscreens, According to Dermatologists - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5fb3NrUXp3U0hZdjJhWDEzVlI5dVRUOHRCam1lcWc0LUx2VjAyWXN2b2gySzhkTFktX0otN25ZRThFbUNzQlNiSVMzd3p4VzRrUWxSVHlpZmZ2OFlnSGJwdmYwNWIwQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While “non-toxic” can be a rather amorphous (and unregulated) term in beauty, a quest to find the best non-toxic sunscreen generally starts with one question: Is it chemical, or physical?&lt;br&gt;“The term ‘non-toxic’ is often used in relation to physical &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-sunscreens" target="_blank"&gt;sunscreens&lt;/a&gt;, whose sun-protective properties rely solely on the mineral filters zinc oxide and titanium dioxide,” explains &lt;a data-offer-url="https://valerieaparovich.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://valerieaparovich.com/"}' href="https://valerieaparovich.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Valerie Aparovich&lt;/a&gt;, a certified cosmetologist, aesthetician, and biochemist at OnSkin, whose job involves analyzing cosmetic formulas for safety. “Physical sunscreens create a shield on the skin’s surface rather than being absorbed into the body and pose no common health concerns through contact with the skin, according to scientific research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, not all physical &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vogue-editors-favorite-sunscreens" target="_blank"&gt;sunscreens&lt;/a&gt; are created the same. “I advise prioritizing safety and efficacy over marketing claims,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.zesthealth.com/providers/rachel-day" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.zesthealth.com/providers/rachel-day"}' href="https://www.zesthealth.com/providers/rachel-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rachel Day, MD&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified dermatologist and Chief Medical Officer at Zest Health, a virtual dermatology clinic. “A truly skin-safe &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-mineral-sunscreens" target="_blank"&gt;mineral sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; will be both protective and gentle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;’s Favorite Non-Toxic Sunscreens:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, find the non-toxic sunscreens that live up to their claims while protecting and nurturing the skin, according to dermatologists and industry pros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In This Story:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blue Lizard Mineral Sunscreen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Of all the pros we tapped to weigh in on this piece—and there were many—nearly every one recommended Blue Lizard Mineral Sunscreen. There must be something in the air, or rather, in the formula, of this dermatologist, biochemist, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; facial plastic surgeon-approved pick. Let’s break it down. &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/"}' href="https://www.schweigerderm.com/providers/nava-greenfield-md-fd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nava Greenfield, MD,&lt;/a&gt; a board-certified dermatologist at Schweiger Dermatology Group in New York City, ticks off its attributes: “This is soothing, as it contains aloe vera, and it’s nontoxic for the skin and environment,” she says. “It’s a mineral sunscreen free of harsh chemicals, and it has broad-spectrum coverage.” Aparovich praises the ingredients. “Featuring a safe mineral filter—zinc oxide—to shield the skin, it provides reliable broad-spectrum protection while rubbing smoothly into your skin,” she says. “A great pick for dry, normal, sensitive, and dehydrated skin, it’s packed with plant-based oils like shea butter and sunflower oil to nourish the skin and protect it from moisture loss.” She adds that it also has aloe barbadensis leaf extract to hydrate and soothe, and caprylic/capric triglyceride and squalane to moisturize the skin and strengthen its barrier. Another recommendation comes from Arnold Breitbart, MD, head plastic surgeon at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://faceliftlongislandny.com" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://faceliftlongislandny.com"}' href="https://faceliftlongislandny.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Long Island Facelift&lt;/a&gt;. “I’ve used Blue Lizard for years—way before the whole non-toxic sunscreen craze. It’s always been one of my go-tos,” he says. “It offers great sun protection, has no harsh chemicals, and it’s good on sensitive skin.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (titanuim dioxide 8%, zinc oxide 10%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Organic aloe, shea butter, sunflower oil, caprylic/capric triglyceride, squalane&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Lotion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 5 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;EltaMD UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/aokKbRGiuxPAtmptpJNicUADwGwXunMqC6TJpUEsDTJDAsh4Q43qgp24c6HYgQTGYwfEtC2q4bJX47s8c6T3RdHRAPJzxoooRLtR4J2iz5GKYPuoeDTS3J44HDpa7frVSbo3cWtP2S3CjyLJyEBEWX8fWzn9eaHNQrGWWBuh5f7kn3WD58MyBdCkzPjH711UTkNVadUrt3JTUnLKcpkBdK4zLkxsicc7EcPzaXvasuUvVRpG5CgnGgsRmwh77iq7Mbp4n5ig11k5PwzwpykJZRHA8wY2sc1Ve31MwBX4ruRNdpbQUgv","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"EltaMD","dangerousHed":"UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Antioxidant-Protection-Environmental-Aggressors/dp/B079YXK3L8","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":1,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9","brand":{"name":"EltaMD"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Antioxidant-Protection-Environmental-Aggressors/dp/B079YXK3L8","price":"$45","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/aokKbRGiuxPAtmptpJNicUADwGwXunMqC6TJpUEsDTJDAsh4Q43qgp24c6HYgQTGYwfEtC2q4bJX47s8c6T3RdHRAPJzxoooRLtR4J2iz5GKYPuoeDTS3J44HDpa7frVSbo3cWtP2S3CjyLJyEBEWX8fWzn9eaHNQrGWWBuh5f7kn3WD58MyBdCkzPjH711UTkNVadUrt3JTUnLKcpkBdK4zLkxsicc7EcPzaXvasuUvVRpG5CgnGgsRmwh77iq7Mbp4n5ig11k5PwzwpykJZRHA8wY2sc1Ve31MwBX4ruRNdpbQUgv","reducedPrice":"$36","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;EltaMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a2301acd72bc9d9fdf9" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;UV AOX Elements Broad-Spectrum SPF 50 Tinted Face Sunscreen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Ideal for sensitive skin, this tinted face sunscreen blurs imperfections in a range of skin tones while infusing the skin with health-boosting antioxidants.

An expert in eczema and psoriasis, she adds that the formula is soothing on skin that’s irritated from either condition. With a lightweight, fluid texture, the sunscreen sinks right into the skin, drying with a matte finish. It’s enriched with a bit of proprietary magic, too: La Roche-Posay’s Cell-Ox Shield technology combines UVA and UVB filters with antioxidant sun protection from tropical-leaf extracts. The brand’s signature ingredient—thermal spring water from the French town La Roche-Posay—is also present in the formula, bringing a soothing touch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (titanium dioxide 6%, zinc oxide 5%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin E, botanical extracts, La Roche-Posay thermal spring water&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 50&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Fluid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.7 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Forah Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/MqMVDRsypCNABGRAF3G9ShJzHnHMfw21qcGRBQ8uefVwJ9ZNKynTuqSgcEivopzQHW9ATb4nj6ofNsg4bP2xgQCc9xof5WgWFp3Sswj5gy57FsjtpTj9H1H1DKz1hL6gJNqaCsBRPCBJuBdzT1Lh93a1wGTQdXEjg1v3xCQpsLqfnnHpHErQTfMC9nyH5a8M3pK424VZ8ki7MXWyXGGpMLwK2cEP4BumCgv9QNTEnfhEDyAQtX6J6p4C2byLYrLTtCnCJwWzKkLJDvhtAJJmxzYX9UBgBfci","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Forah","dangerousHed":"Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"MODA OPERANDI","offerUrl":"https://www.modaoperandi.com/beauty/p/forah/everyday-mineral-sunscreen/663791","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":3,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe","brand":{"name":"Forah"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.modaoperandi.com/beauty/p/forah/everyday-mineral-sunscreen/663791","price":"$55","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/MqMVDRsypCNABGRAF3G9ShJzHnHMfw21qcGRBQ8uefVwJ9ZNKynTuqSgcEivopzQHW9ATb4nj6ofNsg4bP2xgQCc9xof5WgWFp3Sswj5gy57FsjtpTj9H1H1DKz1hL6gJNqaCsBRPCBJuBdzT1Lh93a1wGTQdXEjg1v3xCQpsLqfnnHpHErQTfMC9nyH5a8M3pK424VZ8ki7MXWyXGGpMLwK2cEP4BumCgv9QNTEnfhEDyAQtX6J6p4C2byLYrLTtCnCJwWzKkLJDvhtAJJmxzYX9UBgBfci","sellerName":"MODA OPERANDI","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""},{"offerUrl":"https://goop.com/forah-everyday-mineral-face-sunscreen-spf-30/85-ml/p/","price":"$55","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/39ZGmWZ6fEZzHe7YCVBsPbWd3Z8y9YDDNAXuPTiE7vgKsDKX7hsdk5W91q7YRRhcdGbX5XSE7dXWBRLa5bvVnpQESiwyeW9gw6H3CC7NUpqeKMbiPjTGtS1duYCiWUfVk78muMsLg5tQ8iaXNerhDKDr3QQFW1nZ7J3PkqDqYE3ZfYcJm5yqkmTR9QDQpcUKCjicvGKPs6aSntLs9bm73D77BvPpKfLD2VhTLHznUAY8uFyfhGcGC1HN5vXM52YVv6KCfe9MQV4HUUcJg5g52Vc","sellerName":"GOOP","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Forah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a238c2985de5f2e9cbe" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Everyday Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Like the Erewhon smoothie of sunscreens, Forah’s SPF 30 formula blends a cocktail of antioxidant-packed ingredients—think organic sea buckthorn oil, organic cold-pressed golden jojoba oil, and organic sweet almond oil—that &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; sound good enough to drink. (Please don’t, though.) Greenfield can hardly get enough of the luxurious, chicly packaged sun protection, which is also loaded with collagen-boosting botanical extracts. “It’s certified organic, which I love,” she says. “It has both zinc and titanium dioxide along with antioxidants, natural-based oils, and seaweed extract, which hydrate and protect the skin.

(In addition to the pinkish Original hue, the formula comes in the warm, golden Sunlit shade.) “While protecting your skin from sun damage, the smart formula also blends skincare ingredients like ceramides, peptides, galactoarabinan, bioflavonoids, allantoin, and glycoproteins,” Aparovich continues. “These moisturize and comfort the skin, and support its protective barrier throughout UV exposure.” She adds that the sunscreen works for dry and normal skin types, and is also suitable for sensitive skin. Pro tip: If using it as a makeup base, let the product dry for three to five minutes before layering it with other products.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (non-nano zinc oxide 21.7%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Ceramides, peptides, allantoin, hyaluronic acid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 40&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Fluid&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.3 oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Colorescience Sunforgettable Total Protection Face Shield Flex SPF 50&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/nntVzjQ3JMLounBBCrovvH9o7LcZBctrz8uZ7TYUsqJvV9xwePfNHrMLEsZWBqbLBkUpp7zQGTrdJVD3xqMB239o6c73Gjfdi6h3oyDioRApzbQTje2EyVqKEQiV26Pt7tjdWUuRGtWRqis4tY2tQSeMPNUVq6MV6sn2axGUzj52bJTrVtqBQShjUTgPPFVF64mCdPMkirfrQm52N39kYoGNTvgZbkwiT4YcxQJSatxbZVcAiakyUqX7udKueSUuM5m6t5Lf3vRp8nP2Y6Xa3KHc8SzKs3bmogKbP6Aa","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Colorescience","dangerousHed":"Total Protection Flex SPF 50","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colorescience-Protection-Shield-Formula-Medium/dp/B093W7CDWD","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":5,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246","brand":{"name":"Colorescience"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colorescience-Protection-Shield-Formula-Medium/dp/B093W7CDWD","price":"$54","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/nntVzjQ3JMLounBBCrovvH9o7LcZBctrz8uZ7TYUsqJvV9xwePfNHrMLEsZWBqbLBkUpp7zQGTrdJVD3xqMB239o6c73Gjfdi6h3oyDioRApzbQTje2EyVqKEQiV26Pt7tjdWUuRGtWRqis4tY2tQSeMPNUVq6MV6sn2axGUzj52bJTrVtqBQShjUTgPPFVF64mCdPMkirfrQm52N39kYoGNTvgZbkwiT4YcxQJSatxbZVcAiakyUqX7udKueSUuM5m6t5Lf3vRp8nP2Y6Xa3KHc8SzKs3bmogKbP6Aa","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Colorescience&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a23ab59d7b78e3f1246" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Total Protection Flex SPF 50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; With tone-adapting pigments, Colorescience’s smart SPF 50 comes in four shades ranging from Fair to Deep. “Combining skincare and sun protection, this tinted sunscreen adapts to various skin tones and provides a matte finish,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md"}' href="https://www.mdcsnyc.com/provider/marisa-k-garshick-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Marisa Garshick, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist in Manhattan and New Jersey.

The zinc oxide in question is ultra-sheer, so it vanishes into the skin without a trace—hence, the brand describes this hydrating salve as “invisible natural protection.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical (zinc oxide 19%)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt; Castor seed oil, rosehip seed oil, lavender oil, parsley seed oil, candelilla wax, coconut oil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPF Level:&lt;/strong&gt; 30&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Texture:&lt;/strong&gt; Lightweight cream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1.69 fl oz&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fig. 1 Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn hxReXn callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/9fJ5Pb5roi2FBR7jmAU7qvp49uMDd91koJk937chytUFKQWEMrBb8y5j1mCnQgHTNrkf2YtNt1EJvHfaW5p5SWs7Zs8mVB1dGcM6Szhae4F19CDAmBF2WMsfLDNjJhwhSkcXkXKsRi3eqoPdE9XTudFhYpaN48nEAA1aJkTaWr6WddNHH1DVEkecCCxLFLaPeXg1VMdBX8PkYEUWYQyKzhWsxce7pE5YLvZgKQ6anio5ma2Vc1Zke3sYvuA9GZMAmAuYVDCFx","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Fig.1","dangerousHed":"Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"NORDSTROM","offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/mineral-sunscreen-spf-50/8330143","contentType":"product","productId":"68122a24209719135fb3562d","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":8,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"68122a24209719135fb3562d","brand":{"name":"Fig.1"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/mineral-sunscreen-spf-50/8330143","price":"$38","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/9fJ5Pb5roi2FBR7jmAU7qvp49uMDd91koJk937chytUFKQWEMrBb8y5j1mCnQgHTNrkf2YtNt1EJvHfaW5p5SWs7Zs8mVB1dGcM6Szhae4F19CDAmBF2WMsfLDNjJhwhSkcXkXKsRi3eqoPdE9XTudFhYpaN48nEAA1aJkTaWr6WddNHH1DVEkecCCxLFLaPeXg1VMdBX8PkYEUWYQyKzhWsxce7pE5YLvZgKQ6anio5ma2Vc1Zke3sYvuA9GZMAmAuYVDCFx","sellerName":"NORDSTROM","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""},{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Sunscreen-Invisible-Absorbing-Spectrum-Hyaluronic/dp/B0D5YT5H6D","price":"$29","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/2AtUUZ8dMcfSbovr3cnyWyC643bj2hmBJnYQnbFE5LjJNrRk1F2Kf41zHbs3nSy87zqR67iLUgmmQiFetVAa3FUmA37fPHagmVUvFFMAonJMUTfsHN5aQvzPQECdgbX45c53TZracWvYU2azSSsPNopXV8ifugmtPNttaWCmNLmWUnQr3aSgBtN4GqmaWJcNqHwEqmvPxu8WExt948CTFZeWSqQLCbz97c5oka71z1sF2BWtsqH7Nh996pc3gbqF6E782p6qbRned43eL7xhgXHxsER3r1pmoxvPa3Wgn7pBp","reducedPrice":"$23","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Fig.1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_68122a24209719135fb3562d" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Mineral Sunscreen With Zinc Oxide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Dermatologist-developed and clinically tested.

According to Dr. Day, “Vanicream Facial Moisturizer with SPF 30 offers a practical, cost-effective solution for daily sun protection, particularly for individuals with sensitive skin.” She adds that Vanicream is a long-standing leader in hypoallergenic skincare and is known to formulate its sunscreens without common irritants. “This makes this product a dependable option for my eczema and psoriasis patients seeking broad-spectrum SPF in a well-tolerated, affordable moisturizer," she notes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chemical or Physical:&lt;/strong&gt;

It means that neither UV filters nor any auxiliary ingredients, such as stabilizers, emulsifiers, film-forming agents, preservatives, or fragrances, can induce known or suspected hazards, including skin irritation and sensitization, allergic reactions, endocrine disruptions, genotoxicity, and more,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s commonly thought that, in sunscreens, “non-toxic” refers to mineral sunscreens only, Aparovich dispels the myth. “From a human safety standpoint, sunscreen formulas may include both mineral (physical) and/or organic (chemical) filters, with no adverse effects associated with them,” she stipulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="traditional" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are non-toxic sunscreens as good as traditional sunscreens?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mineral or non-toxic sunscreens are just as effective as traditional sunscreens when used correctly,” says Dr. Day. “For my patients with eczema or psoriasis, I actually prefer them. They’re less likely to cause stinging, burning, or flares, and provide excellent broad-spectrum protection.” Just like any sunscreen, she says, non-toxic ones need to be applied generously and reapplied often, especially after sweating or swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="lookfor" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to Look for in a Non-Toxic Sunscreen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Aparovich advocates looking for a sunscreen formula suited to an individual’s skin type. “People with oily, combination, or acne-prone skin should opt for products free from comedogenic ingredients to avoid clogging pores and triggering inflammation, blackheads, or breakouts,” she says. These ingredients include cacao, palm, coconut, and wheat germ oils, and chemicals like cetylated lanolin alcohol, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl linoleate, isopropyl isostearate, isopropyl palmitate, myristyl lactate, myristyl myristate, laureth-4, oleyl alcohol, and ethylhexyl palmitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the ingredients with the highest comedogenicity rate,” she says. People with dry or sensitive skin should avoid harsh alcohols, such as alcohol, alcohol denat, ethanol, or SD alcohol, Aparovich adds. “These ingredients can compromise the skin’s barrier and cause irritation.” Additionally, she notes that an ideal non-toxic sunscreen should provide broad-spectrum protection to shield the skin from UVA and UVB rays and help reduce the risk of complex DNA damage in skin cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another key point is sunscreen’s sun protection factor, or SPF,” she says. “It indicates how effectively sunscreen can protect your skin from UVB rays, the ultraviolet light associated with sunburn.” Aparovich recommends choosing sunscreens with at least SPF 30, but ideally SPF 50, especially when the UV index is three or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="naturalsunscreen" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a 100% natural sunscreen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Technically, there are sunscreens that claim to be 100% natural, but that term isn’t regulated,” Dr. Day says. “What matters more is that the product is clinically tested, well-tolerated by sensitive skin, and free of known irritants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="ingredients" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What ingredients should you avoid in sunscreen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Three of the most hazardous chemical filters to avoid are oxybenzone (benzophenone-3), homosalate, and octinoxate,” says Aparovich. “Studies have shown oxybenzone to be a common allergen, as well as an irritant to the eyes and skin, and a potential endocrine disruptor.” She adds that homosalate and octinoxate are linked to possible adverse effects on the endocrine system, and that all three ingredients have been shown to have a negative impact on marine life and coral reefs. Additionally, Aparovich recommends avoiding formaldehyde-releasing preservatives like Imidazolidinyl Urea, Quaternium 15, and Diazolidinyl Urea, along with fragrances classified as allergenic, such as cinnamal, citral, farnesol, coumarin, eugenol, geraniol, and others. “These chemicals can trigger allergic reactions and skin irritation,” she notes. Dr. Garshick recommends seeking paraben-free products, as the ingredient can irritate some skin types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="experts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://valerieaparovich.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://valerieaparovich.com/"}' href="https://valerieaparovich.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Valerie Aparovich&lt;/a&gt;

and announced at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting, suggested that 92% of patients who used the new immunotherapy drug, dostarlimab, to shrink their tumors ,continued to be cancer-free for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating cancer usually involves a form of immunotherapy alongside chemotherapy and surgery to remove a tumor. However, the new immuno-based treatment would only require a single step — immunotherapy — to treat the cancer by teaching a person’s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred and three patients participated in the study, 54 with a variety of "solid tumor cancers," including stomach, endometrial and prostate, and 49 with rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/using-only-immunotherapy-successfully-treats-several-cancers-with-mmrd-mutation-improves-quality-of-life" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center that of the 54 patients with a “variety of cancers," 35 had “all signs of their cancer” disappear and were using the immuno-based treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith Collection/Gado/Getty &lt;/p&gt; Sign with logo on the facade of the Memorial Sloan Kettering cancer center in Manhattan, New York City, New York, among the top cancer hospitals in the world, September 14, 2017.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/milk-might-lower-womans-risk-of-colorectal-cancer-study-8772735" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Refrigerator Staple Might Lower a Woman's Risk of Colorectal Cancer, New Study Says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Refrigerator Staple Might Lower a Woman's Risk of Colorectal Cancer, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the release, Dr. Andrea Cercek said, "Nearly 2 out of 3 patients with types of cancer other than rectal were able to preserve their organs and their quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a very significant response, and the results were even better than we had hoped,” Dr. Cercek said. “We found that some cancer types responded extremely well to the immunotherapy, including colon and stomach cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&lt;/p&gt; Maureen Sideris, seated, with her sister Marion, receiving the 8th of 9 immunotherapy infusions during successful treatment for early-stage gastroesophageal junction cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maureen Sideris, a patient who was diagnosed with gastroesophageal junction cancer in 2022 and participated in the study, said that the treatment had worked successfully for her, according to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My husband, Tommy, and I were preparing for the worst,” she recalled in a statement. “But after being treated with only immunotherapy, I had no evidence of cancer and didn’t have to undergo surgery or chemo or radiation. I felt like I won the lottery!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Cerek reported that “20% of non-rectal cancer patients” who still had to undergo surgery “saw lower rates of cancer recurrence."

Researchers said that one patient had a “growth in a lymph node” that was surgically removed but they “kept their rectum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers said that the new treatment comes with its own drawbacks as the immunotherapy drug appeared to only work well with patients who had mismatch repair-deficiency, which means certain cells have mutations when cancer cells separate, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/mismatch-repair-deficiency" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; (NCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the NCI, this mutation “is most common” in “colorectal cancer, other types of gastrointestinal cancer, and endometrial cancer" and can also be found in “cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder and thyroid.” The immunotherapy drug works by targeting cells with this mutation, as the immunotherapy drug can more easily target the many mutations, per the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really excited to help more people,” Dr. Cercek said. “And we are already exploring why rectal tissue seems to have such an extraordinary response to immunotherapy and how we can use that knowledge to help with other cancer types.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/immunotherapy-breakthrough-could-mean-fewer-cancer-patients-need-chemo-11724110" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 22:05:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQYW0wMm9VT3B3ckN3TGktR3Y1VXlpSmhHR1lKWVp6WUZEczdFRHFsSURVMjNocWduQlpLXzFRbDVmVmlTQUNxeVZUamwyQVBhNC1mOEVyT0lYaW9HZzlTY1RSVDh0THNfV0Fac29fclhKSFgxVW9jX0xmQVBtUUlrTmctY21SQQ</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新研究，您应该多吃2种食物以减少炎症- EatingWell | 2 Foods You Should Eat More of to Lower Inflammation, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFA4Vjc1eFVMSEpwbnVrNmVkeEdfVU9SMnBrZVJkZUkwaVowTmVPOHZrbTI4Y2t5ZkNGMW9nOVdHT2FybnhiY0xQQ25qOFEtUU5JV05ZVnBmcS1IdTdiNHF4S3h0YzBCdHpaZnVfeF9BbUU2ZTQ4S1o5R2FoZ2hSdnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is the body’s healing response to injury or infection. When you sprain your ankle, it swells up because your body releases compounds to help it heal. As it heals, those inflammatory compounds are lessened. Similar processes happen when you get sick with an illness, except the inflammation may or may not be so obvious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While inflammation is a necessary part of healing, when that inflammation doesn’t go away and becomes chronic, it raises your risk of disease, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Many things can cause chronic inflammation, including stress and diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers in the United Kingdom took a closer look at diet—specifically, protein sources and fiber—and how they relate to inflammation. They published their findings in April 2025 in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break them down.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The data in this study came from the UK Biobank, a large database that contains medical, lifestyle and health information from about 500,000 UK residents. For this study, researchers used data from 128,612 participants who were at least 60 years old and fit the study criteria. The research team only included participants who had dietary data and bloodwork that included C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on file. CRP is a common measurement of inflammation in the body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers categorized participants into two groups: individuals who had one or no chronic health conditions (based on a list of 43 such conditions) and individuals who reported having two or more of those chronic conditions, which is referred to as multimorbidity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on food diaries from the participants, researchers recorded total protein intake for the participants and split the protein up between animal protein and plant protein. For this study, plant protein included tempeh, tofu, beans (legumes), lentils, nuts and seeds. Animal protein included red meat, poultry, eggs, fish and dairy. In addition, participants’ fiber intake was calculated. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers adjusted for factors like age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, smoking status, alcohol intake, height and weight. Participants self-reported medical diagnoses from a list of 43 conditions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Based on their dietary information and CRP levels, participants were divided into groups: high total protein, low total protein, high dietary fiber and low dietary fiber. These groups were further split up, with low, middle and high categories in plant protein, animal protein and dietary fiber. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After statistical analyses were run, researchers found that plant-based protein and high-fiber foods may help lower inflammation in the body. Specifically, they observed that: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Participants eating a diet low in fiber and high in animal proteins experienced higher inflammation levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Among participants with high, middle and low protein intake, higher inflammation levels were always observed for those who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; had low fiber intake. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In those without multimorbidity (two or more chronic diseases), higher plant protein and fiber intake resulted in lower levels of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For those &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; multimorbidity (two or more chronic illnesses), the association between protein, fiber and inflammation was stronger compared to those without multimorbidity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, as plant protein and fiber intake increased, inflammation levels decreased. The opposite was found regarding animal protein and total protein, which exhibited a significant positive association with C-reactive protein (CRP), which was measured to gauge inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were a few limitations to this study. First, the study population was largely white British older adults, so it is unknown if these results also apply to other populations. It’s also worth noting that when participants self-report their conditions and dietary habits, there’s always a chance that some data may be incomplete or misremembered. Lastly, CRP levels were only measured at baseline, so they might not be indicative of ongoing chronic inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that inflammation plays a starring role in chronic illness. The trick is finding out what’s causing it. This study suggests that consuming high amounts of animal protein and too little fiber are associated with higher levels of inflammation, but that higher intakes of fiber and plant protein are linked with less inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber plays an important role in gut health, providing food for beneficial gut bacteria. There is evidence that a healthy gut microbiome is linked with lower inflammation levels, so it makes sense that plant protein and other sources of fiber would be associated with lower CRP levels. And this relationship is bi-directional—gut health influences inflammation, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-inflammation-harm-your-gut-health-8715529" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation influences gut health&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If this is all overwhelming, a good place to start is with gut health. We know that fiber feeds the beneficial gut bacteria and plant protein provides fiber, so start there. What sources of plant protein can you add to your diet? Where can you swap an animal protein meal with a plant protein one? &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-foods-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-8424134" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Higher protein plant sources&lt;/a&gt; include legumes, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and certain whole grains, like quinoa and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/didietitian-favorite-high-protein-whole-grain-amaranth-8401947" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;amaranth&lt;/a&gt;. This weeklong &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826129/plant-based-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;plant-based diet meal plan&lt;/a&gt; provides a framework to get you going. Use it as is or pick out a few recipes to try. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other plants—including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8004966/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-enough-fruits-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruits, vegetables&lt;/a&gt; and whole grains—even if they aren’t considered high-protein, are also important to include for overall good health and gut health, as they provide fiber, antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You also need plenty of beneficial bacteria—aka probiotics—to nosh on the fiber you’re feeding them. You can add probiotics with fermented foods, so add a little sauerkraut or kimchi to your diet each day. If that’s not appealing, then go with yogurt or kefir.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another limitation of this study is that it didn’t break down healthier sources of animal proteins from less healthy ones. For example, yogurt and kefir are sources of animal proteins that provide probiotics and other necessary nutrients, including calcium and vitamin D. And fish and other seafood provide &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920'" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain- and heart-healthy omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; in addition to protein. But these proteins were all lumped together with other sources of animal proteins, even though they provide a wealth of essential nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We believe that all foods can fit into a balanced, varied diet. So, for example, while you might not want to eat a hamburger each day, now and then is probably fine. Instead of cutting things out, focus on packing your diet with nutrient-dense foods that have been linked with lower levels of inflammation and disease—like plant protein—while sprinkling in other foods you enjoy on occasion—like a burger. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other lifestyle habits have also been linked with better gut health and lower levels of inflammation, including exercise and lower levels of stress. So, move your body more often and examine the areas where stress needs to be lowered. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; suggests that higher plant protein and fiber intake is associated with lower levels of inflammation, and that higher intakes of animal protein and lower fiber intake are linked with higher levels of inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating more plants, including high-protein plants, is important for overall health and disease prevention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Find easy ways to add more plant protein and fiber into your diet and start swapping animal protein for plant protein here and there. Some tasty ways to do this are by replacing the meat in tacos with tofu, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7891013/chipotle-tofu-tacos/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chipotle Tofu Tacos&lt;/a&gt;, or beans, like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/crispy-sheet-pan-black-bean-tacos-11699837" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Crispy Sheet-Pan Black Bean Tacos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;

Kennedy Jr. reprised various misleading claims about vaccines this week, including that the measles vaccine contains cells from aborted fetuses and the mumps vaccination does not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy's comments come as the U.S. battles one of its worst outbreaks of measles in 25 years. Scientists have warned that the U.S. is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, declared eradicated nationally in 2000, and say U.S. public health officials like Kennedy should provide urgent endorsement for highly effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two children have died and hundreds more have been infected in the outbreak in Texas, which is centered in a Mennonite community and has spread to neighboring states, including New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy, who became the nation's top health official in February, has for decades helped sow doubts regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, contributing to a decline in vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy says he is not opposed to vaccines, but has begun to revive some of the unproven or debunked theories he promoted as a lawyer and public figure, now from his perch at the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There are populations in our country, like the Mennonites in Texas, (who) were most afflicted, and they have religious objections to the vaccination, because the MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris and DNA particles, so they don't want to take it," he said in a News Nation interview on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy was referring to the combined Measles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine. The vaccines do not contain "fetal debris" from abortions or intact fetal cells, vaccine experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rubella portion of the vaccine is produced from a fetal cell line originating from an abortion that took place in the 1960s. The MMR vaccine does not contain the cells in its final form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The cells are derived from fetal cells that have been replicated over decades in test tubes in laboratory settings, thousands of times removed from the original ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The virus is grown in these cells, then this virus is purified, meaning everything other than the virus is filtered out, and all that's left is this attenuated virus that can't make you sick," said Dr. Miriam Laufer, Interim Director of the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to a fact sheet on how vaccines are made from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania, the amount of DNA involved in final vaccine preparation is minimal; billionths or trillionths of a gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"While the final vaccines do not contain intact fetal cells, they may contain trace amounts of cell-derived materials, such as fragments of DNA," said Dr. Paulo Verardi, Professor of Virology and Vaccinology and the University of Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy also said this week that the mumps portion of the vaccine does not work and that there were safety concerns over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The problem is really with the mumps portion of the vaccine and the combination. That combination was never safety tested," he said on Monday at a live televised town hall event hosted by TV host Dr. Phil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two doses of the MMR vaccine provide around 86% protection against mumps, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While it is true that vaccine protection can wane over time, the rate varies depending on the disease and vaccine, Verardi and other vaccine experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For mumps in particular, immunity can decline, so adults vaccinated in childhood may become susceptible again. Still, vaccinated individuals generally experience a milder illness if infected, which is still a key benefit of vaccination," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;(Reporting by Ahmed Aboulenein in Washington and Nancy Lapid in Tucson; Additional reporting by Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Caroline Humer and Stephen Coates)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 21:42:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQeFhBcHVfT29vSmNQRExlaUlKSGtxNXRkQTA5Qmo1bkEwUE9LUVM0ZTJydnpNYm9UcHlYeVl1MFh4bTJkd21kNmZuS1RZb1AwVGRXVXhZeEhqNHI3NXNIdExUWV9ObW5sc1ZEakNJTy1ET3Z6M094MVdUWmxVdk1POU5ZUQ</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr计划对“所有新疫苗”进行安慰剂试验测试- BBC | RFK Jr plans placebo-trial testing for 'all new vaccines' - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9Eb0s0YzFWR1pXRWhERWFYLUFCSWRYWVVvR0J4RXB5NDJycDRDRDdoLWFkaW5UY0VSVnlnd3E2Q0Z5TVhDMWJMal96akpCak5HeURmWVR3ZVFJUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5nTEtuSHhfV01rOVNkS3NvQ1IwQm9EV0NpWmxXMlR2cXZGVzhFMDBTa0YwNXdkM1hNVmw4LWJ1V0NzLV9SUGIzdHoxNmpyTFhBaW9ZY1RXVHJwQnlLdDdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The top US health department plans to require placebo testing for all vaccines in an effort to offer "straightforward" public health information, but experts say such testing could limit availability and raise ethical concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a statement first given to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said this week, "All new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure — a radical departure from past practices". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The agency did not provide details on which "new vaccines" would be included. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But officials have suggested that updated Covid-19 shots may be included, which vaccine experts say could slow down vaccine access.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Peter Lurie, a former official with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said "it's hard to tell exactly what is being proposed."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But, broadly, if they mean that every modification to an existing vaccine would require a new placebo-controlled trial, they are treading in ethically dubious territory and likely to deny Americans life-saving vaccines at some point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;HHS has not offered details on the timing of the placebo plan or specify the vaccines involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An HHS spokesperson told the BBC in a statement that health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's goal of "radical transparency" means being "honest and straightforward about what we know — and what we don't know — about medical products, including vaccines". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The statement said none of the childhood vaccines recommended in the US  - except the Covid shot - had undergone "inert placebo" testing, meaning "we know very little about the actual risk profiles of these products". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We have a lot of information about the safety of the vaccine," he said. "All we're doing this year is using a different Omicron variant that we used last year and the year before that." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Still, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said this week that the agency was "taking a look" at updated coronavirus shots, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News that there is a "void of data". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An HHS spokesperson told the BBC that "significant updates to existing vaccines" may be considered "new products" requiring additional clinical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"A four-year-old trial is also not a blank check for new vaccines each year without clinical trial data, unlike the flu shot which has been tried and tested for more than 80 years," the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Requiring companies to conduct placebo tests for simple upgrades of established vaccines would be costly - and the drug makers could ultimately decide to forgo making the newer, more effective versions of the vaccine altogether, said Dr Lurie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Before taking office - and since assuming the role as secretary - Kennedy has spread   false claims about vaccine safety. His tenure has coincided with one of the worst measles outbreaks in a decade; two children have died and 660 people have been infected in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This week, he encouraged parents to "do their own research" about the measles vaccine - which has been considered safe and 97% effective for decades - and raised questions about whether the shot could cause seizures or neurological issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For months, he has at times endorsed the MMR shot, and at other times, called it a "personal" decision. Kennedy also promoted alternative treatments, which doctors say patients should not use without medical supervision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 21:36:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9Eb0s0YzFWR1pXRWhERWFYLUFCSWRYWVVvR0J4RXB5NDJycDRDRDdoLWFkaW5UY0VSVnlnd3E2Q0Z5TVhDMWJMal96akpCak5HeURmWVR3ZVFJUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5nTEtuSHhfV01rOVNkS3NvQ1IwQm9EV0NpWmxXMlR2cXZGVzhFMDBTa0YwNXdkM1hNVmw4LWJ1V0NzLV9SUGIzdHoxNmpyTFhBaW9ZY1RXVHJwQnlLdDdR</guid></item><item><title>HHS吹捧通用流感，冠状病毒疫苗计划，同时对季节性Covid-19疫苗的未来表示怀疑- CNN | HHS touts universal flu, coronavirus vaccine initiative while casting doubt on future of seasonal Covid-19 shots - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPMUV4UDhZczFpbklBcDZka3dTZE1zMFBFdVVONlBkNFN3c0hXR3VFMWNrUG81MDc5ZGJBcDlMYURXa0pnRU1pb01ZZ1ozcW9OWGlnazQtMHJOclB5c0pUSnRkRTRyYmUtNUl6bW5xcTdsNlJmcUJsalJ1UHpKaU56ZTVORlVNRllacTROeS1Hc9IBlAFBVV95cUxOZ0ZUY2xTYjVoOEJfcGJaZVZVV1lQYk5xVFJBYzNxTGdTVVZnQzVMMXIwbmlWRVZ5UHFaSms2UDhRN3lmMXNzZHVCZURwVHVwVlJrM1NzN2phZTRmRGVVaUJVZkt6SXZ1LXRHRU1rUDJzSTJianpvMFdCTUxEM25YRmtMSDNndGZQSkx5c3hpSWZPekhk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The US Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday that it aims to accomplish within four years a scientific feat that hasn’t been achieved&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for the past 45: the development of a universal flu vaccine that could protect against multiple virus strains with pandemic potential, including H5N1 avian influenza.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00022e6a0aeu0g9q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,” National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in a &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-nih-announces-generation-gold-standard.html" target="_blank"&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;on the new initiative. “It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats – not just today’s, but tomorrow’s as well – using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21st century.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00032e6a61zknvgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said the project, being developed in-house at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is targeting US Food and Drug Administration approval of universal influenza vaccines in 2029, with human clinical trials scheduled to start next year. The Wall Street Journal first reported that it will be funded with $500 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a figure confirmed by a spokesperson for HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00042e6aqpdv4zvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I hope it works,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He noted that he trained in a flu lab in the early 1980s that was working on a universal flu vaccine, and one still hasn’t been developed. “It’s not for lack of effort, and it’s not for lack of expertise, and it’s not for lack of money that we don’t have a universal influenza vaccine. It’s just really hard to do.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00052e6adojvt4q1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu viruses are wily because they mutate from season to season, sometimes significantly, and because efforts to protect against all – or many – strains at once haven’t succeeded, we get updated flu shots each year to protect us against the latest circulating strains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00062e6aua4xa41p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A similar paradigm has unfolded for Covid-19 vaccines since they were first authorized in the height of the pandemic at the end of 2020. HHS’s new initiative also aims to develop universal coronavirus vaccines that could provide protection against not just the virus that causes Covid-19 – SARS-CoV-2 – but its cousins SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00072e6abhm5b8uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine technology in HHS’s new initiative uses inactivated whole-virus vaccines, an older approach that delivers an entire virus that’s been chemically tweaked so it can’t infect human cells. The project comes from work being driven by Dr. Matthew Memoli, the NIH’s principal deputy director, and Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger, acting director of NIAID.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00082e6avjt9q1u8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Memoli, who &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/health/nih-interim-director-memoli/index.html"&gt;gained attention&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 for opposing Covid-19 vaccine mandates and reportedly declined Covid-19 vaccination himself, said in &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/trial-potential-universal-flu-vaccine-opens-nih-clinical-center" target="_blank"&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt; that one of the vaccines being advanced in this project, which can potentially be administered through a squirt up the nose, is an attempt “to induce a comprehensive immune response that closely mimics immunity gained following a natural influenza infection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq00092e6aln93g0hb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine experts who are not involved in the project said universal flu and coronavirus vaccines are a worthy goal, but they questioned whether this project could produce one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000a2e6a6djbjb6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Greg Poland, who directs the vaccine research group at the Mayo Clinic, said the accepted scientific definition of a universal flu vaccine is one that would provide at least 75% protection against symptomatic infection with both A and B strain flu viruses for at least a year, and preferably over multiple seasons, for all age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000b2e6ase877hqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland says &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo2167" target="_blank"&gt;research that’s been published&lt;/a&gt; on the most advanced candidate in the new initiative, BPL-1357, describes a vaccine that contains inert versions of four A-strain avian influenza viruses but doesn’t include any B-strain viruses, “which tells me they’re not aiming at seasonal viruses,” he said. “They’re aiming at those viruses that have the potential for pandemicity,” or the potential to start pandemics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000c2e6av2p3aj0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland said he was also surprised by the amount of money being devoted to a vaccine technology that science has largely moved away from.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000d2e6a30iclfc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why would we devise a major program and devote a tremendous amount of resources to an old platform?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5qxpnw00003b6mscvltou0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The advantage of using whole viruses is that they give the body a chance to develop antibodies to many parts of a virus, which tends to create long-lasting protection, even if some parts of the virus mutate. But they can also cause unwanted side effects and adverse reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5rvfok00003b6mcv0d3ny1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whole virus vaccines are typically grown in chicken eggs or cells. In this case, the vaccines under study are grown in canine kidney cells. Those viruses are treated with a chemical called beta-propiolactone, which prevents them from being able to copy themselves in the body and infect cells. The inactivated viruses are then purified and mixed into a shot or nasal spray.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5r6xwi00023b6mgwt4faw9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US used to use flu vaccines made from whole inactivated viruses but has since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473132/" target="_blank"&gt;moved to safer options&lt;/a&gt;, such as subunit or split virus vaccines, which use only a part of the flu virus to create an immune response. Flumist, a nasal spray, uses a whole but weakened version of the virus, so it’s not completely inactivated. Inactivated whole-virus flu vaccines are still used in some other countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000e2e6avupyvwey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Poland and another vaccine expert, Dr. Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, said whole-virus vaccines were once more common, but developers moved away from them because they produce inoculations that are sometimes too strong and can provoke dangerous immune reactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5t2pa0000g3b6mi9g3nlmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m guessing it’s going to be quite reactogenic,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000f2e6ald1wh0wn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He pointed to the 1976 swine flu vaccine, which produced a strong immune response to the whole virus it contained but also caused high rates of Guillain-Barré syndrome, an immune disorder in which the body attacks its own nerves and muscles, causing muscle weakness and paralysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000g2e6ax8dtflg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other whole-virus vaccines, including the first ones developed to fight respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, have caused problems such as immune enhancement, where exposure to the virus after vaccination makes the infection more dangerous, not less.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000h2e6aoccdpuuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a bit of a head-scratcher why they have so much confidence in a whole inactivated virus approach. I don’t quite understand that,” Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5r89m1000b3b6m5v7vvzeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just before it announced its new universal vaccine development plan, late Wednesday HHS threw into question the future of seasonally updated Covid-19 vaccines. The agency said in a statement that “all new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure – a radical departure from past practices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000o2e6aoa2obk0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FDA typically selects strains for updated Covid-19 vaccines in June so manufacturers can ready them for the fall respiratory virus season. The agency has adopted a system similar to the one used for flu vaccines, holding previously that updating only the strain targeted by the vaccine – and nothing else – didn’t represent a change big enough to require new human trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000p2e6aoprfax5m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If HHS now requires placebo-controlled trials before clearing updated Covid-19 vaccines, experts said, that could delay availability of the shots by months, putting vulnerable people at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000q2e6a7m4zlnyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The advantage of updating the vaccine every year to make it more close to the circulating strain is, you get better antibody responses, so for four to six months, you will clearly have better protection against mild to moderate disease, and that matters especially for people who are more frail,” particularly people 75 and older, Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000r2e6am4tf0spr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for HHS didn’t respond to an inquiry about whether the new guidance pertains to updated Covid-19 vaccines, but an official told CNN on Saturday that “the covid vaccines, including new ones by Pfizer and Moderna, are new and must have more gold standard science to ensure safety and efficacy for the public.” The official drew a distinction from the flu shot, “which has been tried and tested” for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000s2e6a2vt8694e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Questions about the fate of Covid vaccines began to swirl after the FDA missed an April 1 deadline to decide whether to grant full approval to the Novavax vaccine, the only non-mRNA vaccine available to protect against the coronavirus. A source familiar with the situation, who wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the agency, told CNN that the vaccine had been on track to be approved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000t2e6azkl4nqga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Novavax later &lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.novavax.com/press-releases/Latest-update-on-U-S-FDA-BLA-for-Novavaxs-COVID-19-Vaccine-1" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;the FDA had requested a “postmarketing commitment” for a clinical trial, suggesting that a study would be required of the vaccine after it received full approval (it had been available through emergency use authorization since 2022). HHS’s newest statement adds to questions about whether a trial would be required before approval, not just for Novavax’s vaccine but also for updated versions of those from Moderna and Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafq000u2e6aclty21n9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a conference call with Wall Street analysts Thursday, Moderna President Dr. Stephen Hoge insisted that the company’s interactions with the FDA so far have been “business as usual” and emphasized the “real need for Covid vaccination, particularly this coming fall.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000v2e6av1k4m2ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Covid-19 has become less deadly since the height of the pandemic as the population developed widespread immunity through both infection and vaccination, but the virus still kills and can be especially dangerous for the elderly. Between September 2023 and August 2024, there were more than 36,000 deaths from Covid-19 among people 65 and older, CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/05-Panagiotakopoulos-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/05-Panagiotakopoulos-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000w2e6aia4llo2e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This month may reveal whether the FDA shares Moderna’s “business as usual” approach. The company is expecting FDA decisions on a next-generation Covid-19 vaccine by May 31 and on an expansion of approval for its RSV vaccine into younger ages by June 12. It said an FDA decision on its combination flu and Covid-19 vaccine would be pushed back from the end of this year to 2026, as the agency said it requires efficacy data on the flu component to support the application.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000x2e6ax3c6uzlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company also said it’s going to “de-prioritize” development of the combination flu and Covid-19 vaccine for people under the age of 50, instead focusing on advancing it for older adults, as it shifts some resources to cancer therapies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cma5pxsao001f2e6a9lnjwg4e@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="changing-standards-may-delay-shots" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Changing standards may delay shots
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000y2e6a0gl1hpeq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the FDA does require placebo-controlled trials before approving updated seasonal Covid-19 vaccines, experts said, it will signal a new standard.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr000z2e6agyz844vg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “FDA clearly, after a deliberative process, adopted an approach that treated Covid-19 vaccine boosters like influenza boosters, not like a new product, and held to that over a few years,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. “They adopted a standard, and now they’re changing it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00102e6afm9653dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency does appear to be moving forward at least with the process of selecting strains; it’s asked its group of outside advisers to hold May 22 as a date to meet to discuss them, according to a person who viewed the communication who wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00112e6amljitbmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In its statement Wednesday, HHS also claimed that current systems for monitoring vaccine safety, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and the Vaccine Safety Datalink, don’t capture vaccine injuries sufficiently and “have become templates of regulatory malpractice.” HHS said it’s building surveillance systems now “that will accurately measure vaccine risks as well as benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00122e6a51qqpznu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine experts pushed back on the assertion that those systems are insufficient. And the plan to build a different surveillance system appeared to come into direct conflict with a pledge that Sen. Bill Cassidy said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made to secure his confirmation vote in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00132e6a5yy5upio@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, Cassidy &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time, has “committed that he would work within the current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems, and not establish parallel systems.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma5pgafr00142e6au5v8nza2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cassidy, a Republican doctor from Louisiana, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria — the powerhouses of cells — carry unique DNA that is mutated in specific diseases, causing cells to be starved of energy. Now, scientists have uncovered a first-of-its-kind molecule that can reverse the effects of common mutations behind these genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They [the mutations] can cause very different diseases for which no cure is available," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cesne.biologia.unipd.it/research-groups/carlo-viscomi/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cesne.biologia.unipd.it/research-groups/carlo-viscomi/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Carlo Viscomi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the University of Padova's Department of Biomedical Science and Padua Neuroscience Center in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the paper really makes a breakthrough," said Viscomi, who was not involved in the research but previously collaborated with some of the authors. "It may open amazing possibilities for these conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the work is that it did not demonstrate how well the molecule works in a living animal or person, Viscomi said. But off the back of the research, scientists went on to develop a similar molecule that's &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pretzeltx.com/pretzel-therapeutics-initiates-phase-1-clinical-study-evaluating-px578-lead-therapeutic-in-its-bioenergetics-restoration-franchise/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.pretzeltx.com/pretzel-therapeutics-initiates-phase-1-clinical-study-evaluating-px578-lead-therapeutic-in-its-bioenergetics-restoration-franchise/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;now being tested in a trial with humans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

These rare, inherited conditions affect an estimated 1 in 10,000 people worldwide and are caused by mutations in the POLG gene, which codes for a key protein in mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-eeHbQV6DbAwkTseVDQSFtG" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-eeHbQV6DbAwkTseVDQSFtG slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA within mitochondria needs to be replicated as new mitochondria are made. Mitochondrial DNA must also be repaired after factors like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; damage it. However, around &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289853/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289853/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;300 different mutations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the POLG gene derail this replication-and-repair process by messing with the enzyme tasked with the job: polymerase gamma (POLG).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLG mutants spur harmful mutations to accumulate in mitochondrial DNA, cause chunks of the DNA to be deleted over time, or both. POLG diseases result in a wide range of symptoms that vary among people and progress at different rates depending on which mutations a person carries and how many copies they've inherited from their parents. "It's extremely variable," Viscomi told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540966/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK540966/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most severe POLG diseases, typically starts triggering symptoms between age 2 and 4; causes liver failure and seizures; and kills within four years of symptom onset. Some POLG-related diseases emerge earlier, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.664278/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2021.664278/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shortly after birth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, while others arise later, between the ages of 12 and 40, or even after 40. Those whose symptoms arise after 40 have the best prognosis and fairly mild symptoms at first, including droopy eyelids and eye-muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, people with POLG diseases survive &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289853/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289853/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between three months and 12 years&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after their symptoms first begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because hundreds of mutations trigger these conditions, they would be challenging to address with gene-editing approaches, like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/gisbl/pi/mdnar" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/gisbl/pi/mdnar" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;William Copeland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a senior investigator and head of the Mitochondrial DNA Replication Group at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in the U.S., who was not involved in the study. For that reason, various groups &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30848931/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30848931/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;have explored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00319-5/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(24)00319-5/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;using small molecules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5618494/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5618494/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to treat the diseases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with limited success, he told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes the new study unique is that it has introduced the "first drug specifically targeted against mutant forms of the POLG gene," Copeland said. And at least in lab-dish experiments, the drug appears to "significantly" improve the function of the POLG protein, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-brain-use-so-much-energy" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/why-does-the-brain-use-so-much-energy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We finally know why the brain uses so much energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="hunt-for-a-promising-drug-3"&gt;Hunt for a promising drug&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers theorized that if they could find a drug that enhanced the activity of healthy POLG, the same drug might work on mutant versions, too. They began by screening a diverse collection of 270,000 compounds to see how they impacted the activity of healthy POLG. This revealed one promising molecule that the team then chemically tweaked, to increase its potency, and tested on common mutants. They dubbed the optimized version of the molecule PZL-A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers focused on just four POLG mutants, rather than studying all 300. However, about 70% of people with POLG diseases carry at least one of these four mutations, they noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a technique called cryogenic electron microscopy to reveal in fine detail how the molecule interacted with each mutant and with healthy POLG. The protein is composed of three parts that fit together: one "A" component and two "B" components. The analysis revealed that the PZL-A compound sits in a pocket between A and B. That pocket happens to be "unaffected by the most common disease-causing [POLG] mutations," the authors noted in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By binding there, the molecule enhances the overall stability of the protein; this, in turn, boosts its ability to replicate and repair DNA, regardless of whether a mutation is present. "They didn't test all the existing mutations, but the mutations they tested, they seem all to be 'rescued,' in a sense, by using this compound," Viscomi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers backed up these initial findings by running lab-dish experiments with cells from patients with the four common mutations they explored. First, the researchers depleted the mitochondrial DNA in the cells, to see how quickly the cells could recover that lost DNA. Cells treated with the compound recovered their DNA far faster than untreated cells did, and even kept up with the healthy version of the protein in some experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wasn't prepared for this outcome — that we would actually find one stone that will kill all these birds," Gustafsson said. "But we did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copeland agreed, saying, "I'm surprised that such a small molecule can stabilize the mutant forms of POLG," as well as stabilize and alter the activity of healthy versions of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has begun testing the compound on additional POLG mutants. So far, they've found that "we see effects in many of these other mutations," Gustafsson said. That recent work has yet to be published. Meanwhile, the clinical trial has just begun to test a molecule that is "structurally very much related" to PZL-A, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical trials will be needed to see if the newfound compound causes any unacceptable side effects and whether it has the expected effects in humans, Copeland said. If it does prove safe and effective, "I'm assuming the patient would have to be on continuous treatment for the duration of their life," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a treatment would fulfill an unmet need for people with these diseases, as current treatments are not aimed at curing the conditions but at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8796686/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8796686/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;managing patients' symptoms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Viscomi and Gustafsson both noted that the depletion of mitochondrial DNA is tied to diseases of aging, including neurodegenerative conditions. So it may be that, beyond POLG diseases, scientists could explore additional applications for the compound.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration looks to be surrendering in the war against germs. A new report from Wired reveals the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has shuttered a federal lab dedicated to studying some of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Wired’s report, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hhs-niaid-irf-ebola-disease-research-stop/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, the Integrated Research Facility in Frederick, Maryland was ordered to completely cease its experimental research by April 29. The facility has long researched the treatment and prevention of “high consequence” infectious diseases, including Ebola and Lassa fever. The facility’s ultimate fate is uncertain at this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/frederick-integrated-research-facility#:~:text=It%20is%20one%20of%20the%20few%20facilities%20in%20the%20world%20able%20to%20perform%20medical%20imaging%20to%20evaluate%20animals%20in%20BSL%2D4%20containment"&gt;Integrated Research Facility&lt;/a&gt; operates under the umbrella of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). It hosts one of the dozen research laboratories in North America allowed to handle germs that meet the criteria for Biosafety Level 4, the highest level of containment; it’s also one of the few places in the entire world where scientists can perform medical imaging on BSL-4 infected animals. BSL-4 pathogens typically cause severe or fatal illness, may be able to spread easily in a lab setting, and have few or no available treatments or vaccines. These pathogens include the viruses that cause Ebola and Lassa, as well as the reconstructed flu virus that caused the 1918 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Wired viewed an email sent by Michael Holbrook, associate director for high containment at the Integrated Research Facility, that detailed the facility’s shuttering. Holbrook reportedly told employees that the facility will be explicitly ending its studies on Lassa fever, SARS-Cov-2, and Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-rare-deadly-mosquito-virus-has-emerged-in-new-york-2000503317"&gt;rare but often deadly mosquitoborne virus&lt;/a&gt; found in the U.S. Northeast. The animals used for these studies, however, will not be euthanized. He added that officials from the Department of Homeland Security would padlock the freezers used for BSL-4 research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The sacrifice to research is immense,” Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Wired. “If things are unused for a period of time, it will cost more money to get them ready to be used again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The HHS’s closing of the Integrated Research Facility shouldn’t come as a complete surprise. After President Donald Trump’s election win last November, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who has since become HHS chief—promised that he would try to &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2024/11/15/trump-pick-rfk-jr-promises-to-end-infectious-disease-research-on-week-one-video.html"&gt;shut down infectious disease research&lt;/a&gt; at the National Institutes of Health as soon as Trump took office. During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy also &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-says-government-ignores-chronic-disease-misguided-rcna190042"&gt;(wrongly) claimed&lt;/a&gt; that federal funding on infectious diseases far outweighed the money spent studying chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When contacted by Wired, a NIH spokesperson characterized the facility’s closing as a “research pause” and appeared to blame staff members for the shutdown, though without any further details. Notably, the facility’s director, Connie Schmaljohn, was also put on administrative leave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This decision follows identification and documentation of personnel issues involving contract staff that compromised the facility’s safety culture, prompting this research pause,” Bradley Moss, communication director for the office of research services at NIH, told Wired.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The government’s stated rationale for pausing work at the Integrated Research Facility might merit some skepticism, however, given how unorganized and destructive the supposed “restructuring” of HHS being carried out by RFK Jr. has gone to date. And seeing as we’re still fresh off the worst pandemic seen in over a century, any sustained pause in infectious disease research is likely to be bad news.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. announced a plan that would require placebo-controlled studies for all new vaccines, surprising some experts who noted that such testing already routinely took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In a statement, Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that “all new vaccines will undergo safety testing in placebo-controlled trials” before approval, and called the move a “radical departure” from existing standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even though modern studies routinely use placebos,&lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;one exception has been the Covid booster shots, which have been authorized without human trials to target new strains of the virus as it has evolved. It’s unclear how the announcement will affect availability of Covid vaccines that were expected to be updated for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy also announced an effort Thursday for the National Institutes of Health to turbocharge the development of new inoculations for Covid, bird flu and seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The new vaccine development initiative would involve methods other than the mRNA technology used to develop the dominant Covid vaccines that are already in use, a statement from the Health and Human Services department said.

Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) received a list of commitments from Kennedy before voting to confirm the secretary. That included a commitment to work within the “current vaccine approval and safety monitoring systems” and giving a 30-day notice to the Senate health committee if the agency seeks to make changes to any federal vaccine safety monitoring programs, Cassidy said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/"&gt;Feb. 4 speech&lt;/a&gt; on the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5P353RCRI5BXJA46C2WILLWL6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a statement to The Washington Post Thursday, Cassidy raised concerns about HHS’s intended shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DRKNLJCQQVBIZCHX3B7R22FSLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The first vaccine for a disease is already proven safe through a placebo-controlled trial,” said Cassidy. “Updating that vaccine does not require a new placebo-controlled trial to determine its safety. To require a placebo group would deny those patients access to the vaccine that has already been found safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SMND7JTT5RHDXOPUTWBGRZ7NWA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Claiming vaccines have risks the data doesn’t show or trying to overstate vaccine risks is not transparency,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California College of the Law at San Francisco who tracks public health vaccine law. “It’s misinformation, and it undermines real transparency and informed consent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KXIWMZDR5ZEUVHSKQZPBYEIXLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Additionally, many vaccines have been tested against placebos, the experts said. And while HHS said the trials would be for “new vaccines,” if Kennedy tries to test vaccines that have already been approved, such as the measles vaccine, against a placebo, that would mean in practice some children would not get vaccinated against the infectious disease while their neighbors did — a quandary that physicians say leaves them susceptible to diseases when there is a vaccine that works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C5M36GTHZNBPZMSIJA3PFGT32Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Stanley Plotkin, a pioneer in the field who developed the rubella vaccine, said that when scientists test vaccines against a new disease, they typically look for evidence that the vaccinated individuals do not get a disease, compared with those who received a placebo. This is how the coronavirus vaccines were tested, in 30,000-person trials in which half of the participants received saline shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K6DDLGDNN5EFJP32D7DBKFU63I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But when a disease is already well understood, scientists can look for evidence that vaccines induce a biological response that has been scientifically shown to protect against the disease — what scientists call “a correlate of protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RN77H467VZETRGSI5GBTAN7MII" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the case of diseases that cause serious illness and can even be fatal, if there are existing interventions, the use of placebos is often not considered ethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="45JUNSUM5VDX7AFUE4X225PHCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Ethics must be taken into account when you set up a study,” Plotkin said. “Can I ethically agree to having people acquire the disease because they receive a placebo?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="API2WOOX5BERHI6B3Z65RNLP44" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="API2WOOX5BERHI6B3Z65RNLP44" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Coronavirus vaccine in play?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YC5YSNXK4RBJZIOJM242X6KVFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The administration has taken aim at reexamining the coronavirus vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AYNJD2OOKJECJCIE5LRIYT4JNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When asked by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0lzUuxmH4w"&gt;CBS News on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; whether the Food and Drug Administration plans to green-light updates to the coronavirus shots, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency was “taking a look.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2QKKP4VXPNELBALY3WTUOOZCMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We have a bit of a public trust problem,” Makary said. “I think there’s a void of data.

The company’s shot has been available under emergency use authorization and is the only vaccine that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/07/13/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorizes/"&gt;uses a more traditional protein base&lt;/a&gt; instead of messenger RNA — an appealing option to some who have reactions to mRNA shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5BZJEKNYN5EYVJPIRVRE3A232I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The FDA was on track to grant full approval to the vaccine April 1, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal deliberations. Top Trump FDA officials told agency regulators to pause the approval, these sources said — which some vaccine experts say amounts to political interference into decisions typically made by career staff tasked with reviewing the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="25KKAGDVKD3JX9EMX8DDNG0NF8" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“To be clear, this is a new product that Novavax is trying to introduce to the market with a study of a different product from 2021. New products require new clinical studies,” Makary wrote Saturday &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrMakaryFDA/status/1916253910039429309"&gt;in a post on X.&lt;/a&gt; Several vaccine experts dismiss the notion that the vaccine constitutes a new product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IA32VGHOIFHHBO3BQA6J7GLEW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Such a move would be costly and suggests a potential shift in how the agency may approach coronavirus vaccines going forward. Typically, Pfizer and Moderna get instructions from the FDA on how to update their vaccines in June. It’s unclear whether they will need to run new clinical trials for their vaccines, which would be unlikely to occur before the annual coronavirus shot in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U2UKR6DSAVA2NHAY2IS6TAH6JY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“While we cannot comment on this specifically, we look forward to continued collaboration with the Administration and teams across HHS,” said Chris Ridley, a spokesman for Moderna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KX43SDV77FBF7FYSICJWRW2AFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Medical experts The Post spoke to predicted that the change by Kennedy could limit new vaccines approved under his watch, as well as slow investment by pharmaceutical companies.

			&lt;p&gt;There's a lot going on in the teeming &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;microbiomes of our guts&lt;/a&gt;, and we're regularly making new discoveries about these bustling miniature ecosystems – including a new study identifying a symbiotic fungus that could fight liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungus in question is &lt;i&gt;Fusarium foetens&lt;/i&gt;, and researchers led by a team from Peking University in China found that in mouse models, it was effective in stopping a fatty liver disease known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22988-nonalcoholic-steatohepatitis"&gt;metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis&lt;/a&gt; or MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More precisely, it was the compound FF-C1 produced by &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; that made the difference. Mice with a MASH-like disease treated with the fungus showed significant improvements in liver health, including lower inflammation levels and less scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159629" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159629" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis.jpg" alt="Enzyme analysis" class="wp-image-159629 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis-335x415.jpg 335w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/EnzymeAnalysis-600x744.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-159629" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team studied the chemical reactions triggered by the fungus in mice. (Zhou et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several observations have shown that bacteria and fungi interact in the gut, where they influence each other through varying degrees of symbiosis," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our model is that elevation of &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; in the gut leads to the generation of FF-C1, which enters the intestinal epithelia by an unclear mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having collected stool samples from 100 people across different parts of China, the team used a newly developed method for isolating and growing the different species of fungus potentially present in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt; of these volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gave the researchers 161 different species of fungi. The ubiquity of &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt; in the samples, and its ability to adapt to low-oxygen environments, made it a prime candidate for further experiments in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as identifying the benefits for liver health, the study also outlined part of the way the fungus appears to be working: it seems the FF-C1 chemical dampens the activity of an enzyme called Ceramide Synthase 6 (CerS6), which lives in the lining of the gut and helps produce &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramide"&gt;fats in the blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less CerS6 means it's less likely that MASH will get started or progress. The researchers backed up their hypothesis by genetically engineering mice to develop without any CerS6, or with too much of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We validated the role of CerS6 in &lt;i&gt;F. foetens&lt;/i&gt;–mediated amelioration of MASH in mice by intestinal-specific Cers6 deletion and overexpression," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5540"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results still need to be repeated in human trials of course, but further down the line, its possible these findings will inspire new treatments. Almost &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41575-023-00846-4"&gt;1 in 3 people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide have metabolic dysfunction–associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), a group of conditions that includes MASH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how busy our guts are in terms of bacteria and fungi, it's likely that many more similar discoveries are waiting to be made – whether that's microbes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxin-secreting-yeast-may-be-behind-some-forms-of-gut-inflammation"&gt;that are causing disease&lt;/a&gt;, or protecting us from them. The same techniques used here could be deployed to identify more helpful fungi in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

Here at WIRED, we've been reporting on the current administration's dismantling of the public health agencies and defunding of research programs. We've tracked all the ways that Elon Musk and his DOGE cohort have been hoovering up all of our sensitive health data and the sensitive health data of millions of Americans without offering a clear explanation of why they're doing it. And we've been watching the shift in culture around vaccines in America, and changing attitudes about what the government's role should be in our collective well-being. On this episode, we're going to talk about all of that. We'll talk about the measles outbreak. We'll talk about all of the other health crises that we really thought we would never have to talk about anymore. But it won't be all heavy stuff, I'm sure we will find a way at some point to have some fun in this show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQUDJOclpMTGlKejF4cHI0QjBRN29aOGkwX0ZBb19tTjJ2a2N4R2NqZnhESUx2NURiUEhZd25aNG1DVGN1ZUkwRFZOUnJuQ1N4RkNRdDdhX0d3NnFQajVsODk1NlhvLVAzZEFSTVdEQTM1cHdXWWFRQ1hfVGNBZW5TSTJNUzJVcy1DY1RNRVNxS3JTOG4tVXc</guid></item><item><title>全球分析发现，男性更容易生病，不太可能寻求三种常见疾病的治疗- Medical Xpress | Males are more likely to get sick and less likely to seek care for three common diseases, global analysis finds - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNZ0lzTXVWNjNzUTRvYk5vbC1udm01dmlnNWc5dXQ1ZGVHNmptZTRuQjVIb1FLNFdabWt2MEl1cWNraFVQc2lnN0NOdXQwRVA4TWxxTWMyQm90dE9pd0xreVpmd3dJWWlDbHBHR1lxTFR4ZzRIc2hLRWtYZjE4NWkzM1JPTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many countries, males are more likely than females to get sick and die from three common conditions, and less likely to get medical care, according to a new study by Angela Chang of the University of Southern Denmark, and colleagues, published in the open-access journal &lt;a href="https://plos.io/44cqSV9" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+policies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health policies&lt;/a&gt; are the same for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/males/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;males&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/females/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;females&lt;/a&gt;, even though there is strong evidence that sex and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gender/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gender&lt;/a&gt; can substantially influence a person's health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers gathered global health data for people of different sexes and ages for three conditions: hypertension, diabetes, and HIV and AIDS. By comparing rates of diseases between males and females and differences in diagnosis and treatment, the researchers sought to illuminate and reduce health inequities between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis identified significant differences between the sexes at each step in the "health pathway," which includes exposure to a risk factor, development of the condition, diagnosis, treatment and death. Males and females received different care for hypertension, diabetes and HIV and AIDS in 200, 39, and 76 countries, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Males had higher rates of disease and higher rates of death compared to females, and, in some countries, were less likely to seek out health care and adhere to treatment. In most countries, males were also more likely to smoke, while females were more likely to be obese and engage in unsafe sex.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Overall, the study suggests that public health professionals need to develop strategies to encourage males to participate in preventive and health care services. The researchers also highlight the importance of examining health data by sex to understand health inequities and guide appropriate interventions at multiple points along the health pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conclude that we need more comprehensive datasets for these and other conditions so that we can monitor for sex differences and implement equitable health care policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professors Kent Buse and Sarah Hawkes, co-founders and co-CEOs of Global 50/50 say, "We have long advocated the benefits of publishing sex disaggregated data. As our Gendered Health Pathways demonstrate, such data can reveal where the health journeys of men and women diverge, be it in relation to the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/risk+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; they are exposed to, their health care-seeking behaviors or their experiences in health care systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is an important first step towards health equity. Most of these differences are not explained by sex (biology) alone, but by socially-constructed gender—highlighting the importance of taking a gender justice approach to reducing health inequities. A gender analysis can help to shape systems of health for all."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Chang, senior author, adds, "The evidence is clear: sex differences persist at nearly every point along the health pathway, from higher smoking rates in men to higher obesity prevalence in women, yet interventions rarely reflect this. Without sex-disaggregated cascade data, we're flying blind—unable to detect who is falling through the cracks in prevention, diagnosis, and care."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "cell of origin" of the second most common lung cancer and the way that it becomes dominant in the lung have been discovered in a new study in mice and humans by researchers at UCL, the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads9145" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, found that a population of basal cells found in the trachea (windpipe) outcompetes other cell types and becomes dominant, eventually invading and occupying large areas of the lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is from these cells, which express a gene called Krt5 that helps to build the structure of cells, that lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) eventually develops. The research team say the findings raise the prospect of earlier detection, and perhaps even prevention, of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lung+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, frequently presenting at a late, incurable stage. LUSC is the second most common subtype of lung cancer and develops when cells accumulate continuous damage from exposure to toxins, usually from smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the cells become increasingly disorganized and eventually form areas of damaged tissue (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/precancerous+lesions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;precancerous lesions&lt;/a&gt;) in the lining of the airways. But the biological changes that occur in the cells during the transition from a normal to a precancer state are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Sam Janes, senior author of the study from UCL Division of Medicine, said, "In this study, we set out to understand the changes that occur prior to the development of lung squamous cell carcinoma and which cell type this cancer arises from.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"We found that a subset of cells expressing the gene Krt5 becomes dominant and starts pushing out &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/normal+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;normal cells&lt;/a&gt;. This expansion becomes dramatic and eventually the descendants of just a few cells that originated in the trachea invade and conquer normal cells, in some cases going on to populate whole lobes of the lung. It is these cells that eventually form tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By understanding the 'cell of origin' where these changes begin and how they develop, the ambition is that we will be able to design strategies to prevent lung cancer occurring in the first place or at least detect it much earlier."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the origins of LUSC, the team labeled Krt5-expressing basal cells in the trachea of two groups of mice so that the descendants of these cells could be tracked over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of mice was then exposed to a carcinogen (cancer-causing substance), to observe how this affected the normal behavior of the cells in the airways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this group, some of these basal cells gradually multiplied before spreading into the lungs, whereas in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt; the basal cells and their descendants remained in their original location in the trachea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sandra Gómez-López, first author of the study from UCL Division of Medicine, said, "Under normal circumstances, the lining of the airways is made up of basal stem cells, as well as luminal cells, helping to protect the lung. When basal cells divide, they give rise to new basal cells or to luminal cells.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Luminal cells perform key functions in the airways, with secretory cells producing protective substances, or ciliated cells that help move inhaled particles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a natural balance between the different cell populations and types, but when these cell populations are exposed to carcinogens like those found in tobacco smoke, this balance is disrupted. Our experiments have shown that populations of cells originating from just a few damaged basal cells in the trachea gradually become dominant, taking over large areas of the lung."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional single-cell RNA sequencing of tracheal cells from mice (comparing healthy control cells vs. those exposed to a carcinogen) and humans (comparing cells from non- vs. current smokers) revealed that as these damaged basal cells colonize the airways, a population of transitional cells expressing a different gene, Krt13, also becomes more abundant, while some luminal cell types become scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also performed DNA sequencing of human trachea and lung samples from people who had smoked. As in the mouse experiment, the results showed that cells from separate precancerous lesions, sometimes in both lungs of the same person, were again descended from the same damaged basal cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers aim to use this knowledge to develop tests to detect the earliest steps towards lung cancer that occur when cells appear normal, in the hope of facilitating earlier interventions. Understanding how these cells become so dominant in the lung may also enable the development of new drugs to stop this occurring, raising the prospect of preventing these cancers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Dr. Talisia Quallo, Research Program Manager in Early Detection and Diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said, "Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the UK, accounting for one in five of all cancer deaths. The disease is often caught late, so it's important that we find ways to detect lung cancer earlier, when there is the best chance of treating it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research reveals the early cellular steps preceding the development of lung &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/squamous+cell+carcinoma/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;, a common form of lung cancer, and identifies the cell type from which this cancer develops. More research is needed, but in the future this information could help scientists to develop new ways to detect the disease earlier or even prevent it from occurring."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Campbell, an author of the study from the University of Cambridge and previously at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said, "Understanding why lung cancer develops where it does can help researchers and clinicians find new ways to predict or detect tumors early, helping to give the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For me, one of the most interesting aspects of our research was discovering that squamous cell lung cancer develops from a precursor cell once it has found a particular environment in the lung, with space to grow and genetically change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that when these specific environments arise, they dramatically increase the risk of lung cancer. In the future, it could be possible to look for these sections in those at risk of cancer and develop treatment plans to prevent or treat lung cancer as early as possible."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of people suffering from osteoarthritis is expected to top 1 billion by 2050. The biggest risk factor for the prevalent, often painful, chronic joint disease is aging. And like aging, there is currently no way to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A discovery by scientists at Henry Ford Health + Michigan State University Health Sciences could pave the way for new breakthroughs in detecting and treating the disease. Their findings were recently &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57308-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our hope is that this discovery will one day allow doctors to catch the disease earlier and intervene before significant joint damage occurs," said Shabana Amanda Ali, Ph.D., a Henry Ford Health assistant scientist and senior author of the paper. "Osteoarthritis is so complex and so heterogeneous that even with decades of research there hasn't been a single therapeutic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists identified a circulating microRNA called miR-126-3p, a mechanistic biomarker of osteoarthritis of the knee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MiR-126-3p plays a role in reducing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessel+formation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessel formation&lt;/a&gt; and reducing the severity of knee osteoarthritis, making it not just a signal of disease—but potentially a contributor to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that scientists are aware of miR-126-3p, they can develop blood tests to detect osteoarthritis of the knee and therapeutics for slowing or even stopping progression. Treatment options for osteoarthritis are currently largely limited to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pain+management/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pain management&lt;/a&gt; and surgical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As we continue to advance our understanding of microRNA mechanisms, we remain hopeful that these insights will translate into tangible benefits for patients suffering from osteoarthritis," said Jonathan Braman, M.D., Chair of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine at Henry Ford Health. "This breakthrough could open the door to precision medicine tailored to individual patients and ultimately fewer joint replacements due to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/osteoarthritis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subtle facial gestures linked to the body's fight-or-flight response could be used to help diagnose people with &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/health-news/health-technology/new-hope-for-ringing-in-the-ears-729852.html" target="_blank"&gt;tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;, a new study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Video recordings showed that people with tinnitus experienced facial twitches and pupil dilation in response to certain sounds, researchers reported April 30 in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adp1934" target="_blank"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time researchers have found a marker that could be used to identify tinnitus in people suffering from the hearing problem, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Imagine if cancer severity were determined by giving patients a questionnaire - this is the state of affairs for some common neurological disorders like tinnitus," senior investigator &lt;a href="https://researchers.masseyeandear.org/details/336" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Polley&lt;/a&gt;, director of Mass Eye and Ear's Lauer Tinnitus Research Center in Boston, said in a news release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we directly observed a signature of tinnitus severity," Polley said. "When we began this study, we didn't know if sounds would elicit facial movements; so, to discover that these movements not only occur, but can provide the most informative measure to date of tinnitus distress, is quite surprising."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is the medical term for ringing in the ears, but it also can present as other persistent phantom sounds like buzzing or clicking, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus affects about 12% of people, including 25% of seniors 65 and older. Most learn to live with the nuisance, but about 15% of people have tinnitus so severe that it disrupts their sleep, mental health and everyday function, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers hypothesized that people with debilitating tinnitus might exist in constant fight-or-flight mode, reacting to everyday sounds as though they were threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 47 folks with varying levels of tinnitus and compared them to 50 healthy people who served as a control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people were videotaped as they listened to pleasant, neutral or distressing sounds. The unpleasant sounds included coughing fits, yelling or a baby crying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence (AI) software, they looked for rapid and subtle involuntary facial movements, like twitches in the cheeks, eyebrows or nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that these twitches correlated with the levels of distress that participants had reported from tinnitus in questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the pupils of people with severe tinnitus dilated extra wide at all sounds, be they pleasant or unpleasant, researchers report. The pupils of people without tinnitus or with less bothersome tinnitus only responded to the most unpleasant sounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining the facial twitches with pupil dilation, researchers found they could accurately identify people most tormented by tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's really exciting is this vantage point into tinnitus severity didn't require highly specialized brain scanners; instead, the approach was relatively low-tech," Polley said. "If we can adapt this approach to consumer-grade electronics, they could be put to use in hearing health clinics, as objective measures in clinical trials and by the public at large."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now using this test to develop ways to eliminate or significantly reduce the loudness of the phantom sounds from tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These biomarkers get to the root of the distress," said Polley. "While imaging might show hyperactive brain regions in tinnitus patients, these biomarkers reveal body-wide threat evaluation systems that are operating outside of their normal range, leading to the distressful symptoms they experience."&lt;/p&gt;

Each new protein source triggered a noticeable turnover in microbial membership, but three diets – egg white, brown rice, and yeast – drove the most dramatic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The composition of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-bacteria-have-very-clever-ways-of-supporting-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; significantly changed every time we changed the protein source,” Blakeley-Ruiz explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did some formerly minor species bloom to dominance, but entire metabolic pathways switched on or off, indicating that the microbes were quickly retooling their biochemical machinery to exploit the new nutrient landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amino-acids-and-complex-sugars"&gt;Amino acids and complex sugars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the scientists compared microbial proteins across diets, two functional categories showed the largest swings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first, amino-acid metabolism, was expected: because proteins are built from amino acids, microbes respond to a fresh influx by either manufacturing more amino-acid-processing enzymes or dialing production down if the amino acids arrive pre-made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice fed egg white or brown rice, the team saw a pronounced increase in enzymes that break down amino acids, suggesting that gut microbes were scavenging these building blocks directly from the diet rather than synthesizing them on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blakeley-Ruiz cautioned that such degradation makes intuitive sense but may have hidden consequences, because certain amino-acid by-products can become toxic or influence brain signaling through the gut–brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dramatic-changes-in-the-gut-microbiome"&gt;Dramatic changes in the gut microbiome &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second major change surprised the team: large shifts in enzymes that degrade glycans, the branching chains of sugar molecules that decorate many proteins. Diets rich in soy, rice, yeast and especially egg white boosted the expression of glycan-cutting enzymes, sometimes dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could be really meaningful, health-wise,” Blakeley-Ruiz said. In the egg-white group, a single bacterial species surged and switched on a broad suite of glycan-degradation genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laboratory tests showed this bacterium expressed a similar enzyme profile when grown in the presence of mucin, the slippery protein-sugar mixture that coats and protects the intestinal lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-erosion-of-the-gut-s-protective-barrier"&gt;Erosion of the gut’s protective barrier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because mucin’s sugars resemble those on dietary proteins, microbes that learn to chew through egg-white glycans might also erode the host’s mucin layer, compromising the gut barrier and allowing inflammation or pathogens to take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m excited to explore this potential connection between the expression of glycan degrading enzymes in the egg white diet and the breakdown of mucin by the gut microbiome in future studies,” Blakeley-Ruiz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-research-directions"&gt;Future research directions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuel Kleiner, associate professor of plant and microbial biology and co-corresponding author, emphasized that the purified diets used here are intentionally artificial. Real meals include multiple protein sources and additional nutrients that could buffer or blunt the effects seen in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the work spotlights egg white as an “extreme” modulator of microbial behavior and sets the stage for follow-up experiments that mix proteins in more realistic proportions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows not only which bacterial species are in the gut microbiome and their abundance, but also what they are actually doing,” Kleiner explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By mapping the enzyme repertoires that microbes deploy for different proteins, the researchers have created a catalog of metabolic responses that future projects can mine to design precision diets or probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nutrition-that-supports-gut-health"&gt;Nutrition that supports gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings arrive amid a surge of interest in how diet shapes the gut microbiome and, by extension, human health. Gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease afflict millions worldwide, and many patients report symptom flares linked to particular foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, mechanistic explanations have been elusive. By revealing that protein source alone can rewire microbial communities in days – altering amino-acid breakdown and potentially stripping protective mucus – the NC State team provides new clues to this puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies in animals and humans could determine whether certain protein-rich &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/contamination-crisis-microplastics-found-in-88-of-protein-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; contribute to disease by nudging the microbiome toward mucus-degrading, toxin-producing pathways, and whether alternative proteins or tailored fiber supplements can steer the gut back to a healthier state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the scientists, there shouldn’t be a one-size-fits-all approach to dietary protein. Understanding how specific proteins influence microbial metabolism is a first step toward personalized nutrition that supports, rather than undermines, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-health-may-be-the-key-to-anxiety-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ismej/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ismejo/wraf048/8089909"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISME Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 17:05:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNU3VnUmx6cHJUSG5MZ2lNeUEyRVBGLTZwNlp2dURJdkUtWnhHYU9lcEpnZzNTWnFHSlhSQUwtMERVbk1VeW1WVUpfT0xXNlBwYlB3TFlQZzg3TU5RVTY5UnB0b1hmdlpmMEhIS3JoSFNrOHJmR19yajI5QzR3NjgwXzZQN0dsbkd6V1E</guid></item><item><title>芝加哥市郊库克县发现2例麻疹病例-芝加哥街区俱乐部 | 2 Measles Cases Found In Chicago, Suburban Cook County - Block Club Chicago</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQejFzd0FVX095QW9EN0s2UVcyREN1N19MMzRjZjlvUXAyZTh2OFdxNHFsaDZRZFVJMnV4ZzZaQl96eTk2Q3NtVW1ocW5mOHI5SXcwUER5cHBOY2dxWEwwN0k0TDB6SmhfZmhUZlh0TjBIdzU2bnllV2xVaUdTeDVUS2IzcjVtYUxBSkotRDRCM0RXRHY5UVJqN0pR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

		
		&lt;p&gt;IRVING PARK — A confirmed measles case has been found in a Chicago resident, and another was found in a suburban Cook County resident, health officials announced Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first two measles cases this year in Cook County, according to a news release from the city and county health departments. The agencies are coordinating to investigate, identify and notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is relatively rare in the Chicago area; last year, an outbreak marked the &lt;a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/05/30/measles-outbreak-in-chicago-contained-city-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"&gt;first time Chicago had a confirmed measles case since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. That outbreak — with the majority of cases found among people staying at shelters for migrants — was contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chicago is no stranger to measles after our outbreak last spring, and having contained it once, we know we can do it again,” Chicago health commissioner Dr. Olusimbo Ige said in the release. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine “is an extremely effective tool for combatting illness and saving lives in our community. It’s never too late to get vaccinated and protect yourself from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s first confirmed case was found in a Chicago adult who traveled internationally through O’Hare Airport in early April. They developed a rash April 25 and have been isolating at home since being diagnosed, according to the health departments. The adult had received one dose of the MMR vaccine; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two doses are recommended for the best protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other case was found in a suburban Cook County adult whose vaccination status is unknown. The person went to a local hospital for medical care April 28 and was isolated after the illness was identified, according to the health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at these locations April 21-28 might have been exposed, according to the agency:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;April 21 at Fittingly Delicious, 3939 W. Irving Park Road&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-8 p.m. April 22 at O’Hare Airport, especially Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-8 p.m. April 23 at O’Hare Airport, especially Terminal 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-12:30 p.m. April 25 at Aldi, 7235 39th St. in Lyons&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10 a.m.-12:30 p.m. April 27 at Shell, 3901 S. Harlem Ave. in Stickney &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;10:20 a.m.-1 p.m. April 28 at Mobil, 2945 S. Harlem Ave. in Berwyn&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials initially warned about an April 21 exposure at the Chicago Public Library Independence Branch, 4024 N. Elston Ave. But by Thursday, investigators determined the person with measles did not visit the location, and no additional action needs to be taken by people who visited the library that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes, according to the health department. It can take seven to 21 days for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone presenting symptoms of measles should call their doctor or an emergency department before going there in person so staff can make arrangements to protect other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-know-about-measles"&gt;What To Know About Measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is rare in Chicago because there is a high vaccination rate in the city, but reports of cases have increased in the United States in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being fully immunized with the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to protect against being infected by and spreading the virus, Dr. Sameer Vohra, Illinois Department of Public Health director, said in the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vaccine is widely available to people 1 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. We encourage anyone who is unvaccinated, or under-vaccinated, to speak with their medical provider and take appropriate steps to get up to date on the recommended shots,” Vohra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can be dangerous for unvaccinated people, particularly babies and young children, health department officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness spreads easily through the air. When an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes, the virus can remain in a room for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, hearing loss, life-long brain damage and death, according to health department officials.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Misinformation has contributed to declining vaccination rates and fueled recent outbreaks” of measles, said Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim Cook County health department COO. “The MMR vaccine has been in use for over 50 years, is highly effective and has protected millions of lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-primary-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-primary-background-color has-background is-style-wide"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to the Block Club Chicago podcast:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his recent Netflix documentary, Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever, tech millionaire Bryan Johnson reveals that he includes NAD precursors in his expansive supplement routine, totaling more than 50 pills a day.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;There's a good reason for that—NAD is an essential molecule that cells use to generate energy and many other vital cellular processes. Levels in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/skeletal+muscle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt; decline by up to 30% with age, which has led to speculation that NAD supplementation can support health and counteract aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research from the Treebak Group from the NNF Center for Basic Metabolic Research at the University of Copenhagen suggests that it may be a waste of money. In a study &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550413125002128" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/i&gt;, scientists found that reducing skeletal muscle NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels in mice by 85% did not accelerate aging or impair whole-body metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that skeletal muscle can tolerate substantial NAD depletion without loss of function or accelerated aging," says Associate Professor Jonas Treebak, corresponding author of the study. "This challenges the prevailing view that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; decline is a primary driver of muscle aging and frailty."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD helps mitochondria in cells produce energy in the form of ATP. However, scientists do not fully understand the extent to which the decline in NAD affects mitochondrial function and aging in general. For example, how low can NAD levels drop before an effect can be noticed?&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Healthy skeletal muscle function not reliant on high NAD levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study these questions, the scientists created a special type of mouse whose NAD levels could be reduced specifically in skeletal muscle after they became adults. This allowed the scientists to test the effect on mature muscle, avoiding any confusion with how NAD might affect muscle as it develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though these mice had much lower NAD in their muscles, their muscle size, overall health, strength and exercise performance were all normal. Detailed studies of the cell's genes, proteins, mitochondria and DNA markers, called DNA methylation, remained normal despite the low NAD levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the mice with low muscle NAD did show increased energetic stress during exercise and some minor changes in how they processed energy, the overall markers of their whole-body and muscle health stayed the same as regular mice, even after they lived their entire lives with low muscle NAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to what might have been expected, healthy skeletal muscle function is not as reliant on high levels of NAD as previously thought. Importantly, our findings indicate that reducing muscle NAD levels well beyond the modest drops seen with normal aging does not cause &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/muscle+weakness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;muscle weakness&lt;/a&gt; or make the muscle age faster," says Sabina Chubanava, who carried out the research as a Ph.D. student and Postdoc in the Treebak Group.&lt;/p&gt;

In the beginning, she didn’t take the sport too seriously. “I went to practice, but I usually ran whatever was the shortest option available,” she recalls. Back then, she says, running was a “good, healthy” part of her life. But after a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-break-up-with-someone.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;difficult breakup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in her senior year of high school, her approach changed. She started using exercise as a way to cope with emotional pain and soon became competitive about her race times. &lt;/em&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I was probably doing a three- or four-mile run five days a week,” she says. Around the same time, a friend announced she was giving up &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/05/new-nutrition-labels-will-call-out-percentage-of-added-sugar.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;processed sugar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and Kelly remembers saying, “Oh, cool, I’ll do that with you.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma467qql000v3b6dmz0o9u2b@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That dietary change “flipped a switch,” says Kelly, who is now a brand-strategy consultant on the West Coast. “It triggered more restrictions.” Up until then, Kelly had eaten fairly intuitively. She had never felt critical of her body. But giving up sugar made her newly health-conscious. “I ate like somebody who needed to lose weight, but I should have been eating like somebody who was fueling for performance and energy,” she says. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma467qqc000u3b6dadqojpxi@published" data-word-count="59"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kelly had been having regular &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/menstruation-full-moon-red-moon-cycle-white-moon-cycle.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;periods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; since she was 13, but when she was 18 and made these lifestyle changes, her period stopped. “I was told by coaches and doctors, ‘Oh, that is just something that happens to active women,’” she says. Years later, when she started thinking about starting a family, the severity of her condition became clear. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma467qux000w3b6dqfwlofzw@published" data-word-count="7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below, Kelly recalls her journey to motherhood.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu600160iggp0pc0y08@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;During my freshman year of college, my parents sat me down for a talk. They were worried that I was exercising too much and had grown too thin. They said, “Will you just go to a doctor and have them run some labs?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma4689uk00173b6df183hg4s@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;So I went to a primary-care doctor and they ran a bunch of labs and they said that everything was normal. My BMI was right at the bottom of the healthy range. And so I said to my parents, “Look, see, I’m fine.” I got even deeper into running at that point — running half-marathons and marathons and doing well in them.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu600180iggue4vsyze@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;I ran in a recreational league in college, and though we didn’t compare notes, I definitely knew a handful of other women who also had lost their periods. That normalized it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma468nzd001h3b6dy3rys8nl@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;Plus, I was off and on birth-control pills, depending on if I was in a long-term relationship or not. When I was on the pill, it let me push the questions surrounding my period to the back of my mind, because when you’re on the pill, it masks your natural period. I bled no matter what, because of the synthetic hormones.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma460vu6001a0iggdysm2bwe@published" data-word-count="81"&gt;When I was a sophomore, I started getting a bit suspicious. I had this nagging feeling of, &lt;em&gt;Maybe this isn’t healthy; maybe I should go off the pill and see if I get my period naturally.&lt;/em&gt; I went off the pill and, sure enough, I didn’t get my period. I made an appointment with my gynecologist and said, “I’m a runner. I’m not getting my period. It’s been like this for a long time. Is this bad? What should I do?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469355001q3b6dqsylqr12@published" data-word-count="52"&gt;And the doctor said, “Look at you! You’re healthy. You love running. You’re not trying to have a baby right now. It’s fine. And when you want to have a baby, you can always come back. We can talk about IVF! But you’re nowhere near there, so I wouldn’t worry about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469355001r3b6dbuoxcdau@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;I trusted him. He was the doctor who delivered me — this old, lovely guy. I also didn’t question what he said because I was afraid of gaining weight. If he had told me, “Look, this is unhealthy. This is not good. You need to stop this,” I would’ve listened. It would’ve been hard for me, but I would’ve listened to him. But the opposite of that happened. I thought, &lt;em&gt;Well, I was a little worried, but the doctor said it’s fine. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469356001s3b6d8nd0q8eg@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;So I kept running. At my peak, I was running more than 70 miles a week and eating a little more than I had been in high school. After that doctor’s appointment, I didn’t think about my missing period for a long time. I went back on the pill and I graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469fcb00293b6dqz0jenaz@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;In my late 20s, I switched from the pill to a copper IUD without hormones, one that wouldn’t affect my menstrual cycle. I still didn’t get my period. At that point, I started to feel like I was in menopause. My hair was getting thin and falling out, and I had a huge crash in energy. I just felt weird and horrible and off. Without the pill, I began to feel in my body what it meant not to menstruate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469l6o002i3b6duy9csgr7@published" data-word-count="33"&gt;By then, I had also fallen in love, and though I wasn’t ready for kids, I could imagine having them fairly soon. That’s when I finally admitted to myself, “This is probably bad.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma469ugq002z3b6dld25u1x2@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;The physician ordered an MRI to see if I had a pituitary tumor — that came back negative. They also conducted a Provera challenge, in which the patient is given a course of synthetic progesterone to see if it will induce menstruation. I failed it. But I still didn’t get any kind of diagnosis. Instead, they told me, “Oh, you have this thing that happens to active women,” and said, “It’s possible that eating a little more could help. You could try cutting back your running a bit and increasing your calories a bit.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46a71j003h3b6d3jj4xfbs@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;Right about then, a book came out called &lt;a href="https://www.noperiodnowwhat.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Period, Now What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;It was written by Nicola Sykes, who has a Ph.D. in computational biology. She went through this experience herself and realized that there should be better information about it available.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46acut003q3b6d4awaz4vq@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;Reading the book, a lightbulb went off. I had a textbook case of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24431-hypothalamic-amenorrhea"&gt;hypothalamic amenorrhea&lt;/a&gt; (HA) — when the hypothalamus causes your period to stop. That can happen due to low energy availability, excessive exercise, or chronic stress. HA can cause short-term issues like fatigue and mood swings and lead to bigger problems down the road, like bone loss, heart risks, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46acut003r3b6d9teuzeup@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;In the book, Sykes wrote that to recover from this, you need to stop &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;intense exercise — anything that gets your heart rate up — and consume at least 2,500 calories a day. If you do those things, then your period will come back.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46ampk00483b6d7ag8qiwp@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;I read the book and my first reaction was like, “I know this is me, but oh my God, you have to stop doing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; intense exercise? I’m a runner! This gives me so much joy. I’m in all these groups of friends that are runners!” I couldn’t imagine doing that. So I decided, &lt;em&gt;I’ll eat more and I’ll exercise less&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9p004h3b6dgpqtygt7@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;I switched to a high-calorie diet with no restrictions whatsoever — I ate lots of pizza, ice cream, pasta. I prioritized high-carb foods and frequent meals throughout the day. Eating more was easier for me to wrap my head around than not exercising. So for a few months, I didn’t change much about my running. But still, no period. So then I ran a little bit less, and a little less and less and less — and I still didn’t get my period. Finally, after about six months of this, another lightbulb went off and I realized,&lt;em&gt; This gradual method is just going to prolong how long it takes me to recover. If I want to get back to running a lot, I have to stop completely for now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9q004i3b6dsfzlx12n@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;So I stopped all exercise. I biked to work — an easy bike ride — and that was it. At first, not running was the hardest thing I’d ever done. It was excruciating. I just felt so antsy all the time, and I really, really wanted to run. If I saw somebody jogging in the street, I’d feel so jealous and sad and conflicted and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46at9q004j3b6dhsaxv39t@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;But then I woke up a week or two into those six weeks and I was like, &lt;em&gt;Oh, wow, I don’t care if I run today or not. I’ll do this as long as it takes.&lt;/em&gt; I soon noticed that life had a lot more ups and downs, and that was a surprise. Sometimes I felt good, and sometimes I felt bad. I realized that for the past decade, it was as if I had been putting a blanket over everything, because running was very effective at making me feel even-keeled. If I did ten miles in the morning, I’d have all these endorphins, and the rest of the day, nothing much bothered. But the thing is, things should bother you.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46b3pe00503b6dpyehrfdm@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;My period came back six weeks after I fully stopped running. I remember discovering that I had my period and thinking, &lt;em&gt;Oh my God, this is amazing. This is beautiful. &lt;/em&gt;It had been ten years since I’d had one. I was so angry that none of the doctors said to me, “Hey, this is a thing that happens to people and we know how to recover from it. This is what you have to do.” Instead, I treated myself after reading a random book.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46bg3p005i3b6dsbb7bife@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;I gained weight during this time, about maybe 10 or 12 pounds — I’m four-foot-ten, so that’s a lot on me. I had to buy new clothes. It was a little difficult, mentally, because I was used to being extremely thin. I was about to get married and I remember when I went to my last dress fitting, they said, “Oh, actually, you’re not as skinny as you were when we first fit this, so we have to take it out a little.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46blg0005r3b6dia1fvv47@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;At first, that made me uncomfortable, but I was so sold on the idea that I was doing the right thing. I knew it was healthy, and I experienced a major shift in my mind-set. I just thought, &lt;em&gt;Yeah, it’s working! They &lt;/em&gt;should &lt;em&gt;take my dress out because I shouldn’t have been the size I was before. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c0e900683b6davkmv04v@published" data-word-count="70"&gt;After about a year, we decided to try for a baby. I was back to running, but not super competitively at all — I was interested in other things now. I was probably doing around 30 miles per week. I had already been tracking my cycle very closely, because when you have had HA, you’re more prone to losing your period again. So I knew exactly when I was ovulating.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7ge006h3b6dm0r9cxum@published" data-word-count="159"&gt;It took me three cycles to get pregnant, and then I miscarried. But that miscarriage was not a heartbreaking experience for me. One day, I thought I got my period, and then my period just didn’t stop. Normally, my periods are maybe four or five days long, and I was on day nine and I was still bleeding, and I thought, &lt;em&gt;What is going on?&lt;/em&gt; I went to my OB/GYN — a new one — and she asked me if I’d taken a pregnancy test. And I said, “No, you don’t understand, I am on day ten of my cycle. I haven’t even ovulated yet.” I was kind of frustrated with her. My experience over the past decade had destroyed my trust in doctors and made me feel like if I wanted good care, I needed to be the one to make sure it happened — I couldn’t blindly trust doctors to be doing the right thing for me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006i3b6dm06xu3dj@published" data-word-count="51"&gt;She said, “Okay, that makes sense, that’s fine, but why don’t we just rule it out?” So I went to the bathroom, took the pregnancy test, and it was positive, and I was like, “Oh my God, I’m not on day ten of my cycle. I’m still on the previous cycle!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006j3b6dx6f9loz4@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;We found out it was a nonviable pregnancy, and I had to have a D&amp;amp;C — I think because they were worried it might be ectopic. But because I had never gotten excited over a positive pregnancy test, I just thought, &lt;em&gt;Wow, how cool I can get pregnant! &lt;/em&gt;I didn’t feel too sad at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46c7gf006k3b6drxohim3v@published" data-word-count="18"&gt;Three cycles later, I was pregnant again. And this time, the pregnancy went great. I loved being pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46cgrb00713b6dsbhs5jt4@published" data-word-count="35"&gt;The birth was complicated and bad. My baby was born with the cord wrapped around his neck and he was totally blue: low Apgar score. He had to be in the NICU for a week.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007a3b6d9pubt7k1@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;They discharged me, and then I came back to the hospital the very next day to be with him in the NICU. I had a friend who was an OB at the hospital. When she came to say hi and see how I was doing, I said, “I feel okay for having just given birth! But I do feel like I’m a little bit swollen.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007b3b6dnq1q9nrv@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;In fact, I had mentioned to the nurses before I was discharged that I felt like I looked very, very swollen. My hands, my face, my legs, my ankles. I felt uncomfortable, and I didn’t look like myself. But the nurse kind of laughed at me and said, “No, no, I’m more swollen than you! You’re not that swollen. This is what happens postpartum!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007c3b6dsoil4y1a@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;I thought, &lt;em&gt;Okay, that’s fine.&lt;/em&gt; But then my OB friend said, “Sure, that can be normal, but since you’re here at the hospital, why don’t you just get your blood pressure taken and make sure everything’s okay?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq1007d3b6dl5jvxq39@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;So I walked around the corner to labor and delivery, and I said, “I feel kind of swollen. I just gave birth. Can you guys take my blood pressure?” They were a bit dismissive, and they said, “You don’t look that swollen, and we’re super busy right now. Can you come back in a few hours?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq2007e3b6dt6kkpf13@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;When my friend came back to check on me and I told her what happened, she said, “You know what? I’m just going to take your blood pressure myself.” She took my blood pressure, and all these alarms went off. It was like 200 over 100 or something crazy. They checked me in immediately — I had postpartum preeclampsia, and I had to be inpatient for a week. That was horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq2007f3b6d9dmrb0kj@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;A lot of people don’t realize that you can get preeclampsia up to six weeks postpartum. It’s even more deadly postpartum because doctors are less likely to catch it. So I was very lucky that I was in the hospital visiting my son in the NICU and that my friend was there. As far as I know, this had nothing to do with my history of HA — preeclampsia is just a thing that can happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46coq2007g3b6dm63r2mei@published" data-word-count="28"&gt;My son was actually discharged one day earlier than me, so my last night in the hospital was our first night with him in the room with us.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46czjh007x3b6dwiqfsyfz@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;I feel so grateful that I found a way to recover from HA before I became a parent. I’ve heard stories of women with HA who, instead of recovering, do IVF to get pregnant. It’s scary to think that I could have gone through pregnancy in the compromised health state that HA puts you in. And it’s even more scary to think that I could have become a mother in the compromised emotional state that led me to develop HA in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63200863b6dphgrm75z@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;I was very rigid about food and exercise. Becoming a parent, especially in the early days, forces you to put someone else’s needs before your own and give up control. This is a stressful shift even for people who are mentally fit. I can’t imagine doing it from the mind-set I was in when I had HA.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63200873b6d7wdu83un@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;I have two sons now — they are 6 and 4. With both boys, when I was postpartum, I felt myself itching to fall back into my old eating and exercising patterns. I was burning tons and tons of calories through breastfeeding, and I think as a result, I just felt this intense desire to run a lot and not eat enough in a way that was weird and surprising to me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63200883b6d61i1rxt1@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;But as soon as I would follow through on these urges a little bit — like, say, &lt;em&gt;Oh, I’m going to go on a long run, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Oh, I’m not going to have a snack &lt;/em&gt;— suddenly I was like, &lt;em&gt;Wow, that’s interesting. I notice that this behavior pattern in my brain is definitely not what I want, so I’ll stop that. &lt;/em&gt;I could feel it starting, but I knew there was no way, with everything that I’ve been through, that I’d let it progress to its end.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cma46d63300893b6d2nl9ql60@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;As I’ve gotten older, I see that when I was younger, I thought, &lt;em&gt;Running is my thing!&lt;/em&gt; I still love running, and I can’t imagine life without it. But now that I have two kids and my career, there have been times when I’m running more and times when I’m running less. I’m grateful that I was forced to recover from HA because it made running just one thing among many that I enjoy, and sometimes it takes a backseat, and that’s good.&lt;/p&gt;

Ask whether it’s really in the best interest of the patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Johnson acknowledges that 'CT scans are a wonderful technology,' he adds that doctors 'may want to consider potential alternatives.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CT scans are used to diagnose and monitor cancers and bone injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/new-cancer-risk-data-suggest-hitting-pause-routine-ct-scans-2025a10009xo?icd=login_success_email_match_fpf&amp;amp;icd=login_success_email_match_fpf"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;for Medscape, Dr Johnson said: 'CT scans are a wonderful technology. There’s no doubt of that. However, we may want to consider potential alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We may also want to ask ourselves whether these scans are the best tools we have and ultimately whether they will change patient management.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CT scans, which use ionizing radiation to create detailed images of the body, are not the only imaging tool doctors have at their disposal. They are best used for imaging of bones, soft tissues and organs and are frequently used for detecting tumors, fractures and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Johnson noted the FDA has recognized ionizing radiation as a carcinogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr David Johnson is urging doctors to reevaluate if CT scans are really in their patients' best interests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are similar scans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An x-ray also uses radiation - though a lower dose - to produce images of the body, but those images are less detailed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While CT scans produce 3-dimensional images, x-rays only produce 2-dimensional images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MRIs use no radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the machines use magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of soft tissue and organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they are more expensive than CT scans (costing as much as $12,000 per scan) and take longer, which can prove fatal if images are needed right away in an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While an MRI can take between 30 and 60 minutes, a CT scan only takes about 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Johnson first raised concerns about CT scans and cancer risk in a 2009 opinion &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2009.184"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wrote: 'Unfortunately, there is little cognizance among health-care providers (or their patients) about the relative latent cancer risks associated with repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given the exposure of a relatively high proportion of the population to these tests, it is incumbent on healthcare providers to have an improved understanding of these risks and discuss them accordingly with their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risks and benefits of these tests should be carefully analyzed and radiation exposure risk assessment should be conducted as part of the selection of diagnostic and screening tests.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the estimated percent lifetime risk of death from cancer that is attributable to the radiation from a single CT scan of the head&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the estimated percent lifetime risk of death from cancer that is attributable to the radiation from a single CT scan of the abdomen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That same year, researchers estimated high doses of radiation from CT scans were responsible for two percent of all cancers (roughly 30,000) per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, recent &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778?resultClick=1"&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;estimated 'CT-associated cancer could eventually account for five percent of all new cancer diagnoses annually.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, a study by California researchers estimated that, over the lifetime of the millions of people receiving CT scans, about 103,000 radiation-induced cancers from the scans are projected to result from tests done in 2023 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Johnson said in the video that the findings 'were quite striking.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers warned CT machines emit unsafe levels of radiation that can fuel the formation of tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest number of projected cancer cases in adults was linked to CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, followed closely by chest CTs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across all patients, the most frequently associated cancers were lung, colon, leukemia, and bladder cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among female patients specifically, breast cancer emerged as the second most common type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco medical school, is one of the authors of the new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her new research, the team found the three most common cancers observed in exposed patients were lung cancer - 22,400 cases - colon cancer - 8,700 cases- and leukemia - 7,900 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the number of CT scans performed in millions (right axis and blue lines) and the incidence of cancer per 1,000 CT scans (left axis and black lines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the projected number of CT-induced cancers by body region exposed to the scan in adults&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimated radiation-induced cancer risks were higher in children, despite adults receiving more CTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men and women experienced CT-related cancers at about the same rate across all ages and number of scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer risk related to CT exposure was highest in people in the 60s and lowest for children under 10 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Smith-Bindman previously told NBC: 'It’s unfathomable. We keep doing more and more CTs, and the doses keep going up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said between two machines, one could be exposing patients to 10 to 15 times higher radiation doses than the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'There is very large variation and the doses vary by an order of magnitude — tenfold, not 10 percent different — for patients seen for the same clinical problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure is measured in millisieverts (mSv), which measures the amount of radiation absorbed by the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People are exposed to small amounts of radiation every day from their background environment or through things like flying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, a roundtrip flight between New York and Tokyo exposes a person to 0.19 mSv. An x-ray of the stomach emits 0.6 mSv.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2009 study looked at the radiation dose associated with the 11 most common types of CT scans performed on 1,119 adult patients in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the projected number of CT-induced cancers by body region exposed to the scan in kids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiation exposure varied widely. Average doses ranged from 2 mSv for a head CT to 31 mSv for an abdominal and pelvic CT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers found the amount of radiation emitted by CT scanners varied widely across the four hospitals they collected data from - with a 13-fold difference between the highest and lowest doses for each scan type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an attempt to tackle the problem, new Medicare regulations effective this year will require hospitals and imaging centers to collect and share information about the radiation emitted by their scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The regulations also require a more careful inspection of the dosing, quality and necessity of CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new rules, issued in the final weeks of the Biden administration, are being rolled out over three years in hospitals and outpatient clinics and providers could face fines if they do not comply, beginning in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Trump administration has not commented on its plans to follow, revise or reverse the new policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Cases of whooping cough are climbing across the country this year, with about 6,600 already documented — nearly four times the number at the same point last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4dixt800003b6m2bigmlu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, there were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough in the United States, the highest in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Ten people died&lt;/a&gt;, including six babies less than 1 year old.

            Given the rise in cases, I wanted to know what causes whooping cough, how it spreads and what the symptoms are. What vaccine is recommended to prevent it, and who should get it? Why do cases appear to be surging? And what should people who are concerned about whooping cough do protect themselves and others?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;highly contagious respiratory illness&lt;/a&gt; caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. These bacteria are spread from person to person. If someone infected with pertussis coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets are released that contain the bacteria. People nearby can become infected by breathing in the droplets. The bacteria can also be spread through prolonged close contact when people share the same breathing space — for instance, when infected people &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/whooping-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20378973" target="_blank"&gt;hold a baby&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are the symptoms?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; generally start seven to 10 days following infection. Initially, an infected person develops symptoms similar to a cold and other mild respiratory infections, such as a low-grade fever, runny nose and cough. The cough often then progresses to a severe hacking cough that is characterized by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;violent coughing fits&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6086000t3b6m51au6b57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During these coughing fits, people may make a high-pitched “whoop” when they try to take breaths after they cough, hence the name whooping cough. The fits may be so severe that they vomit during or afterward. Many struggle to sleep as a result. Some may have trouble breathing, and patients have been known to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;break their ribs&lt;/a&gt; due to the severity of the force associated with coughing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Pertussis is especially dangerous in infants. Globally, it is a significant cause of disease and death in infancy, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/pertussis#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 1 in 3 babies younger than 1 year old infected with pertussis will need care in the hospital, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC statistics&lt;/a&gt; also indicate that about 1 in 5 of those hospitalized develop pneumonia, 1 in 50 have convulsions, and about 1 in 100 will die from their complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition, there are people with preexisting health conditions that may be exacerbated by pertussis. These &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/postexposure-prophylaxis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;include&lt;/a&gt; those who are immunocompromised or have moderate to severe asthma.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How long does recovery take? Can anything speed it up?&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Length of time to recover depends on the individual. Coughing fits typically last between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;one and six weeks&lt;/a&gt;, but they can persist for as long as 10 weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The treatment for pertussis is antibiotics. There are a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;common antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; that are effective against pertussis, including azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin. The earlier the treatment begins, the better the prognosis. Early treatment has been shown to reduce severity and the time to recover.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; In some patients, the diagnosis can be made simply by hearing the characteristic cough. Others who are a bit more subtle will &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pertussis/symptoms-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt;require testing&lt;/a&gt; via a nose and throat swab.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            People infected with pertussis can spread the bacteria from the time their symptoms start until at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;two weeks&lt;/a&gt; after coughing begins. Many cases of pertussis may be spread by people who think they have a run-of-the-mill virus before their severe coughing fits begin. Early use of antibiotics can shorten the time someone is contagious.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What vaccine is recommended to prevent it? At what ages should it be given?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600133b6mizgsh19u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;two types&lt;/a&gt; of combination vaccines that include protection against pertussis, the DTaP vaccine and Tdap. These vaccinations include protection against tetanus (the “T” in each name) and diphtheria (the “D” and “d” in those names).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600143b6mg85cjyry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/administering-vaccine.html" target="_blank"&gt;DTaP&lt;/a&gt; series is five doses of the vaccine given at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months old, then 15 months through 18 months old, then 4 years through 6 years old, according to the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule. Tdap is then recommended for all adolescents, with the preferred age of administration being 11 to 12 years old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600153b6m2iowjobs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults who never received Tdap should receive a single dose. To maintain protection, all adults should also receive a booster &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;every 10 years&lt;/a&gt;. And pregnant women are recommended one dose of Tdap during a pregnancy to be given during gestational weeks 27 through 36 to convey some antibodies to their baby. Getting the vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/about-vaccine.html" target="_blank"&gt;reduces&lt;/a&gt; the likelihood of contracting pertussis as well as the severity of the disease if one were to get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e608600163b6mi3wc09n3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why are pertussis cases increasing?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The exact cause is not known, though there are some hypotheses. One is related to the Covid-19 pandemic: More people were wearing masks, isolating and taking precautions that reduced transmission of all respiratory illnesses. As a result, there were fewer pertussis cases then, with a rebound once these precautions stopped. Moreover, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; for DTaP along with other childhood immunizations have been declining. This is an unfortunate development. People should be reminded that during the early part of the 20th century, before widespread availability of the pertussis vaccine, pertussis was a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;major cause&lt;/a&gt; of childhood mortality in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Completing the DTaP series is important, as is receiving the Tdap vaccine for those who are eligible. Individuals with symptoms of pertussis should get tested so that they can know if they have pertussis and prevent spread to others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e5y6y000o3b6m5v12st0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People should also know that the likelihood of spread within a household is high. In addition to good handwashing and the limiting of contact with infected people, the CDC recommends that everyone who shares a household with someone who has pertussis, even if they don’t have symptoms, should get antibiotics within 21 days of the beginning of the cough in that initial person.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cma4e6zhq001c3b6mpu9hy9dc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This method of receiving antibiotics after exposure, known as post-exposure prophylaxis, can help reduce their chance of contracting pertussis. In addition, the CDC supports providing antibiotics to people at high risk of severe infection within 21 days of exposure to someone who has pertussis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cutting-edge weight-loss drug &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/general-health/ozempic-2665708850.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ozempic/Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; can stop and even reverse fatty liver disease, a new clinical trial has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly twice as many people taking &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/semaglutide.html" target="_blank"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; stopped their fatty liver disease without further scarring of the organ -- 63%, compared with 34% of those taking a placebo, researchers reported April 30 in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/" target="_blank"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 15 million Americans -- 1 in 20 adults-- suffer from fatty liver disease, also known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from the clinical trial "provide strong evidence that semaglutide can help patients with MASH by not only improving liver health, but also addressing the underlying metabolic issues that contribute to the disease," lead researcher &lt;a href="https://liverinstitute.medschool.vcu.edu/about/team/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Arun Sanyal&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Virginia Commonwealth University Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health, said in a news release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MASH occurs when fat builds up in the liver, leading to inflammation and scarring. The condition has been linked to obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-644147.html" target="_blank"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, elevated cholesterol levels and &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/hypertension/high-blood-pressure-hypertension-645539.html" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cleveland_Clinic/" target="_blank" title="Cleveland Clinic" class="tpstyle"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drug. It works by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone, which helps control insulin and blood sugar levels, decreases appetite and slows digestion of food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the clinical trial, researchers recruited 800 people in 37 countries with moderate to severe liver scarring from fatty liver disease and randomly assigned roughly two-thirds to take semaglutide for 72 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with a reduction in liver inflammation, about 37% of semaglutide users showed less liver scarring compared to about 23% in the placebo group, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, about a third of semaglutide users achieved both inflammation reduction and scarring improvement, more than double those taking placebo, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide also helped people lose weight, improve their liver function, and boost their overall heart health, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By treating both liver disease and its metabolic causes, semaglutide offers a promising new approach for millions of patients," Sanyal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is only one U.S. government-approved treatment available for fatty liver disease, &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/rezdiffra.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rezdiffra&lt;/a&gt; (resmetirom), researchers said. It works by activating a thyroid hormone receptor that promotes reduction of fat buildup in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturer of semaglutide, Novo Nordisk, plans to seek U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/" target="_blank" title="Food and Drug Administration" class="tpstyle"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; (FDA) approval for the drug to treat fatty liver disease later this year, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;If you've ever tried to build a new habit – whether that's exercising more, eating healthier, or going to bed earlier – you may have heard the popular claim that it only takes 21 days to form a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a neat idea. Short, encouraging and full of promise. But there's just one problem: it's not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 21-day myth can be traced back to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671700758/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0671700758&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=jamesclear-20&amp;amp;linkId=6DQ32IRAG3LU4PKA"&gt;Maxwell Maltz&lt;/a&gt;, a plastic surgeon in the 1960s, who observed it took about three weeks for his patients to adjust to physical changes. This idea was later picked up and repeated in self-help books, eventually becoming accepted wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as psychologists and behavioural scientists have since discovered, habit formation is &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-does-it-really-take-to-form-a-habit/"&gt;much more complex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How long does it really take?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674"&gt;2010 study&lt;/a&gt; followed volunteers trying to build simple routines – such as drinking water after breakfast or eating a daily piece of fruit – and found it took a median of 66 days for the behaviour to become automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2488"&gt;reviewed several studies&lt;/a&gt; looking at how long it took people to form health-related habits. We found, on average, it took around two to five months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the studies that measured time to reach automaticity (when a behaviour becomes second nature) found that habit formation took between 59 and 154 days. Some people developed a habit in as few as four days. Others took nearly a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wide range highlights that habit formation isn't one-size-fits-all. It depends on what the behaviour is, how often it's repeated, how complex it is, and who's doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What determines whether a habit will stick?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habit strength plays a key role in consistency. A &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.626750/full"&gt;2021 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; focused on physical activity and found the stronger the habit (meaning the more automatic and less effortful the behaviour felt) the more likely people were to exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not entirely surprising that easy, &lt;a href="https://bjgp.org/content/62/605/664"&gt;low-effort behaviours&lt;/a&gt; such as drinking water or taking a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="159871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; tend to form faster than complex ones like training for a marathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whatever the habit, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-024-00305-0"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; sticking to it is not just about boosting motivation or willpower. Interventions that actively support habit formation – through repetition, cues and structure – are much more effective for creating lasting change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, programs that encourage people to schedule regular exercise at the same time each day, or apps that send reminders to drink water after every meal, help build habits by making the behaviour easier to repeat and harder to forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_159875" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159875" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/drink-water-642x428.jpg" alt="Forming New Habits Can Take Longer Than You Think.

&lt;p&gt;But what stood out most was that even small, everyday actions can grow into powerful routines, when repeated consistently. It's not about overhauling your life overnight, but about steadily reinforcing behaviours until they become second nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8 tips for building lasting habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to build a new habit, here are some science-backed tips to help them stick:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it time. Aim for consistency over &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2488"&gt;60 days&lt;/a&gt;. It's not about perfection – missing a day won't reset the clock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3505409/"&gt;Make it easy&lt;/a&gt;. Start small. Choose a behaviour you can realistically repeat daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach your new habit &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2488"&gt;to an existing routine&lt;/a&gt;. That is, make the new habit easier to remember by linking it to something you already do – such as flossing right before you brush your teeth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0144929X.2020.1801840"&gt;Track your progress&lt;/a&gt;. Use a calendar or app to tick off each successful day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212267215011181?casa_token=-VKsr03fXOUAAAAA:pKV0oAB5VVuj8RcPAW5T7prjo3efSVpi6P6TXFoeTLHBX_vFK0ttF6tFM9-8Fp6o45XPu_lcij5d"&gt;rewards&lt;/a&gt;, for example making a special  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="159871" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; after a morning walk or watching an episode of your favourite show after a week of consistent workouts. Positive emotions help habits stick, so celebrate small wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morning is best. Habits practised &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fhea0000510"&gt;in the morning&lt;/a&gt; tend to form more reliably than those attempted at night. This may be because people typically have more motivation and fewer distractions earlier in the day, making it easier to stick to new routines before daily demands build up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal choice boosts success. People are more likely to stick with habits &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00560/full"&gt;they choose themselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674"&gt;Repetition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in a stable context is key. Performing the same behaviour in the same situation (such as walking right after lunch each day) increases the chances it will become automatic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the 21-day myth matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Believing habits form in 21 days sets many people up to fail. When change doesn't "click" within three weeks, it's easy to feel like you're doing something wrong. This can lead to frustration, guilt and giving up entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, understanding the real timeline can help you stay motivated when things feel slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence shows habit formation usually takes at least two months, and sometimes longer. But it also shows change is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/12/23/2488"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bjgp.org/content/62/605/664"&gt;other evidence&lt;/a&gt; confirm that repeated, intentional actions in stable contexts really do become automatic. Over time, new behaviours can feel effortless and deeply ingrained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So whether you're trying to move more, eat better, or improve your sleep, the key isn't speed – it's consistency. Stick with it. With time, the habit will stick with you.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255118/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.octavebio.com/"&gt;Octave&lt;/a&gt; said the test received certification from the New York State Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program (CLEP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That certification is a “major milestone,” Doug Biehn, president and CEO of Octave, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428661291/en/Octave-MSDA-Test-Gains-NY-State-Certification-Expanding-Access-Nationwide"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;. “The fact that the MSDA Test has achieved this quality standard should give all U.S. physicians the greatest possible confidence in the rigor and reliability of Octave and its MSDA Test results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS is a chronic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can vary widely from person to person. Managing the disease is often complex, and depends mostly on a clinician’s interpretation of symptoms and MRI scans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Octave says its MSDA test offers a complementary approach to guide care decisions by providing quantitative data about disease activity. The test measures the levels of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/09/06/octaves-ms-blood-test-accurately-captures-disease-activity-study/"&gt;18 proteins in the blood&lt;/a&gt;, and uses artificial intelligence to make sense of the data and provide real-time reports with “actionable insights,” Octave said. It’s the first validated test of its kind, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Measuring individual patients’ disease activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the heterogeneity of MS, having the ability to look beyond the clinical exam and incorporate an individual’s measured disease activity will allow us to focus on managing the needs of each patient,” said Bianca Weinstock-Guttman, MD, a neurology professor at the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test has been available since 2022, when it was commercially launched, to patients followed in MS centers of excellence, academic institutions, and independent neurology practices across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinicians who have been using it as part of routine MS care say &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/04/22/disease-activity-test-helps-ms-care-decisions-study/"&gt;the test has been useful&lt;/a&gt; in guiding treatment decision-making. A study found that in nearly one out of five cases where the test was used, MSDA results led to changes in care decisions, and more than half of the clinicians agreed or strongly agreed that a single MSDA test result helped guide their decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSDA test can be administered to people with MS at any stage of their disease course, including years after disease onset and &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a blood sample is collected, the MSDA test is performed in Octave’s laboratory, which has Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certification and College of American Pathology accreditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CLEP’s certification, which is based on an &lt;a href="https://wadsworth.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/CLEPGUIDE_Mar2025_FINAL.pdf"&gt;evaluation protocol&lt;/a&gt; to assess the performance of laboratory testing, is another testament to the rigor and reliability of MSDA test results, according to Octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The MSDA Test has the potential to redefine clinical care for MS patients today and well into the future,” said Weinstock-Guttman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Buxhoeveden, chief scientific officer at the Accelerated Cure Project for Multiple Sclerosis, praised the test’s usefulness. “As a clinician, researcher, advocate and MS patient, I live the challenges of managing MS,” Buxhoeveden said. “The MSDA Test has given me invaluable insights that helped me navigate my own disease while also providing tremendous peace of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Accelerated Cure Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating MS research efforts,  contributed data from its biorepository for the development of the MSDA test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Octave MSDA Test is the compass to care that we have been seeking,” Buxhoeveden said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes for Health (NIH) today announced the development of the next-generation, universal vaccine platform, Generation Gold Standard, using a beta-propiolactone (BPL)-inactivated, whole-virus platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initiative represents a decisive shift toward transparency, effectiveness, and comprehensive preparedness, funding the NIH’s in-house development of universal influenza and coronavirus vaccines, including candidates BPL-1357 and BPL-24910. These vaccines aim to provide broad-spectrum protection against multiple strains of pandemic-prone viruses such as H5N1 avian influenza and coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our commitment is clear: every innovation in vaccine development must be grounded in gold standard science and transparency, and subjected to the highest standards of safety and efficacy testing,” said HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program realigns BARDA’s operations with its statutory mission under the Public Health Service Act—to prepare for all influenza viral threats, not just those currently circulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Generation Gold Standard is a paradigm shift,” said NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. “It extends vaccine protection beyond strain-specific limits and prepares for flu viral threats – not just today’s, but tomorrow’s as well – using traditional vaccine technology brought into the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generation Gold Standard, developed exclusively by NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="spaced"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recalibrates America’s pandemic preparedness&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike traditional vaccines that target specific strains, BPL-inactivated whole-virus vaccines preserve the virus’s structural integrity while eliminating infectivity. This approach induces robust B and T cell immune responses and offers long-lasting protection across diverse viral families. Moreover, the intranasal formulation of BPL-1357 is currently in Phase Ib and II/III trials and is designed to block virus transmission—an innovation absent from current flu and COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embodies efficient, transparent, and government-led research&lt;/strong&gt;. The BPL platform is fully government-owned and NIH-developed. This approach ensures radical transparency, public accountability, and freedom from commercial conflicts of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marks the future of vaccine development&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition to influenza and coronavirus, the BPL platform is adaptable for future use against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza. It also offers the unprecedented capability to protect against avian influenza without inducing antigenic drift—a major step forward in proactive pandemic prevention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials for universal influenza vaccines are scheduled to begin in 2026, with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval targeted for 2029. The intranasal BPL-1357 flu vaccine, currently in advanced trials, is also on track for FDA review by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):&lt;/strong&gt;
NIH, the nation's medical research agency, includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH is the primary federal agency conducting and supporting basic, clinical, and translational medical research, and is investigating the causes, treatments, and cures for both common and rare diseases.

Older or damaged cells put people at higher risk of cognitive decline and chronic diseases such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-6218db20-25e5-11f0-b65d-e37d95cf0d09"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While you can't control your chronological age, eating a Mediterranean diet, being physically active, reducing stress, and eating well can help maintain a lower biological age or turn the clock back further.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Analyzing around 14 years' worth of health data from more than 280,000 people in the UK, average age of 57 the researchers found those who developed dementia were biologically older (55 vs. 45) at baseline, according to blood and organ function biomarkers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the most advanced biological age were about 30 percent more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the researchers relied on advanced algorithms to calculate people’s biological ages, DailyMail.com has revealed a 24-question quiz that will reveal how old your body really is - despite how many years you've been alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say that simple tweaks to diet, exercise, and sleep can help reduce a person's biological age, or how old their body's cells and tissues are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say a good result is a biological age that is slightly younger than the chronological age, or the number of years someone has been alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longevity experts at NOVOS based in New York City, have made an AI-powered tool that estimates one's biological age without using blood test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test is free, involves no needles, and is based on results from 47,000 Americans and Europeans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People taking the test first answer questions on their ethnicity, gender, education level, and income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The test also asks users for their arm circumference, which can point to muscle mass and fat distribution. If this is not known, users are told they can input the US average of 13 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also a question on blood pressure where participants used data from the American Heart Association to estimate their blood pressure in cases where they do not know their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A healthy range is 120/80 mmHg, while an unhealthy range is 120 to 129 mmHg and less than 80 mmHg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are asked about lifestyle, including weight gain in recent years, their alcohol consumption, and if they get out of breath walking up stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tool then analyzes the data to reveal a biological age, which is sent to users via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The online calculator is just an estimate as it takes extensive testing to determine a person's biological age.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study by Chinese researchers, the team determined &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13992279/ability-balance-one-leg-old-bones-biological-age.html"&gt;people’s biological ages&lt;/a&gt; by measuring lung function, blood pressure, and cholesterol, as well as other blood biomarkers, including average cell volume and white blood cell count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average chronological age at the study's start was about 57 while the average biological age was around 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When dividing the participants into four groups based on biological age, researchers found those with the most advanced biological age were about 30 percent more likely to develop dementia than those in the lowest group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with a higher biological age tended to be older, male, current or former smokers, and carriers of the APOE 4 gene, which is linked to a higher likelihood of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brain scans reveal how accelerated biological aging shrinks critical brain structures, specifically gray matter volume (GMV). Faster aging (measured by KDM-BA and PhenoAge) correlates with reduced gray matter volume in memory and cognitive regions (A-D) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers employed two different algorithms to calculate individuals' biological ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One, called KDM-BA, uses a machine-learning model that compares nine health measurements in a person - such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and lung function - to population averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If biomarkers are worse than expected for their chronological age, they receive an older biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other algorithm, PhenoAge, estimates biological age using 10 measurements - including inflammation and metabolic markers such as glucose - combined with chronological age in a mortality-predicting formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Higher biological age scores calculated by both were tied to smaller volume in the vast majority of people’s brain regions, especially in the hippocampus, where memories are processed and stored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a higher biological age as determined by the KDM-BA algorithm, exhibited a thinner cortex, or the brain’s outer layer, in 40 brain regions, particularly those involved in memory and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a higher biological age as determined by the PhenoAge algorithm, exhibit cortex thinning across 45 brain areas, with the most significant shrinkage occurring in regions responsible for sensory processing and emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal Neurology, found 36 to 40 regions of the brain that showed thinning were also associated with an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bryan's biohacking and restrictive diet have transformed his appearance, shown in 2018 (left) and 2023 (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This cortical thinning accounted for approximately eight percent of the heightened risk associated with accelerated biological aging, indicating it plays a significant – but not exclusive – role in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While thinning brain tissue contributes to dementia risk, other aging-related factors (like vascular damage or protein buildup) likely drive the majority of the danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the people who later developed dementia had an average chronological age of 65 at the start of the study, compared to 57 for those who stayed free of dementia, their average biological age was 55 by one of the methods, compared to 45 for those with no dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yacong Bo, a researcher at Zhengzhou University in China, said: ‘These brain structure changes explain some, but not all, of the association between advanced biological age and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These results support the hypothesis that advanced biological age may contribute to the development of dementia by causing a widespread change in brain structures.’&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in good news for those seeking to turn back the hands of time, reducing stress can lower your biological age by just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists also argue that simple tweaks to diet, exercise, and sleep can help reduce a person's biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And biohacking in the quest for longevity has surged in popularity in recent years, with followers trying to reduce their biological age to live longer and avoid illnesses such as heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Famous biohacker Bryan Johnson, 47, claims the biological age of his lungs is 18. He also claims to have the heart of a 37-year-old, the skin of a 28-year-old, the gum inflammation of a 17-year-old, and the nighttime erection rate of a teenager.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bo said: ‘With the rising impact of dementia around the world, identifying risk factors and implementing preventive measures is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While none of us can change our chronological age, we can influence our biological age through lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 14:39:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
