                                        &lt;p&gt;GRAYS HARBOR COUNTY, Wash. (AP) — A Washington state resident is believed to be the first person to die from a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-infection-washington-h5n5-b8921d13aa7d96330654a960f80453c3"&gt;rare strain of bird flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but state health officials said Friday the risk to the public is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person, an older adult with underlying health conditions, was being treated for a bird flu called H5N5 after becoming seemingly the first known human infected by the strain, according to a statement from the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person from Grays Harbor County, about 78 miles (125 kilometers) southwest of Seattle, had a backyard flock of domestic poultry that had been exposed to wild birds, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk to the public remains low,” the statement from state health officials said. “No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said they will monitor anyone who came in close contact with the person, but “there is no evidence of transmission of this virus between people.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement about the infection that said no information would suggest “the risk to public health has increased as a result of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;H5N5 is not believed to be a greater threat to human health than the H5N1 virus behind a wave of 70 reported human infections in the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. Most of those have been mild illnesses in workers on dairy and poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story has been corrected to remove references stating the person who died was a man. Officials have not released the person’s gender.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    &lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr. said in an interview with the New York Times that he personally instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to change its long-standing position that vaccines do not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Countering decades of science showing vaccines to be safe, the public health agency's website was changed to say, "The claim 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Kennedy said that while the large-scale epidemiological studies of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had found no link to autism, and that studies of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal had also shown no link, there are gaps in the vaccine safety science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The whole thing about 'vaccines have been tested and there's been this determination made,' is just a lie," Kennedy said in his first interview with a major print publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is a longtime vaccine skeptic and not a scientist. Before he took up his role as head of Health and Human Services, the CDC was a key opponent of growing global anti-vaccine sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The phrase 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by science," Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts, doctors and scientists have decried &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51408073" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;the update&lt;/a&gt; as the kind of misinformation the CDC has fought for decades as it promoted the use of lifesaving childhood vaccines both in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and other health agencies around the world have repeatedly said evidence shows vaccines do not cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many large-scale studies in hundreds of thousands of children across the world have thoroughly investigated the claim that vaccines cause autism and found no link between vaccines and autism. Based on existing evidence, vaccines do not cause autism," the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Kennedy said he ordered the CDC to change its guidance in part because high-quality large studies had not been conducted to examine a potential link between autism and other shots given in the first year of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those include the hepatitis B vaccine and a combination shot that protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A revamped committee that advises the CDC on vaccine policy is scheduled to meet early next month to consider new recommendations for hepatitis B vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also said he had spoken with Sen. Bill Cassidy, who disagreed with the decision, about the website changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

According to a &lt;a class="link" href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-tests-preliminarily-positive-avian-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; from Grays Harbor County health officials last week, the person was considered “older” and had underlying health conditions. Their symptoms included a high fever, confusion and trouble breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person had a backyard flock consisting of mixed domestic poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testing by the health department found virus in the “environment of the flock ... making exposure to the domestic poultry, their environment, or wild birds the most likely source of exposure for this patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the state’s health department said they were monitoring other people who were exposed to the flock and environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular strain of bird flu, H5N5, had never been seen in a person before. It appeared first in 2023, infecting birds and mammals in eastern Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(24)00808-8" target="_blank"&gt;research published last year&lt;/a&gt; on the novel strain, some infected animals carried a key mutation in the virus that allows it to transfer more easily between mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologists and virologists worry that avian influenza could generate a pandemic if allowed to spread and mutate. For instance, the H5N1 virus circulating in dairy cattle in North America &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-05/just-one-mutation-can-make-h5n1-a-threat-to-humans"&gt;is one mutation away&lt;/a&gt; from being able to spread easily between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time a bird flu virus infects a person, concerns grow that it could change, becoming more transmissible or more deadly. For instance, if a sickened person also has another flu virus replicating in their body, there’s concern the viruses could exchange genetic material. Just by having an opportunity to replicate and evolve millions of times in the human body, it could acquire deadly mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say the risk to the public remains low and that no other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza. They say there is no evidence of transmission of the virus between people, but they are monitoring anyone who was in close contact with the patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 02:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNY184WXQweVc4Uk9IUHl1MzhBaTVubTBmRUs2QTNPZ2ZBSmFaNmdhTnh5bDZiaTBEWW1ZeHRjZU5JU1JkVFdUSXhLOFhpbEI4Zi1zc3dpbFFTN1FyenVRTF9XLTVHdGZZY2pqV00zZTRQaEhhT2xPeGdLVTJHY0FLaGJJN2RoZDBqbV9YbzZmLU9yczZBSzl5QVNER3dIVXNJX2UwZ3Ixc0VuaDlm</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿居民死于人类从未报告过的禽流感病毒并发症- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/21/health/washington-bird-flu-death</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A Washington resident died of complications from an infection with a bird flu strain never before reported in humans, the state Department of Health said on Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq900083b6qgyj2dqqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The patient was an older adult with underlying health conditions who had been hospitalized and undergoing treatment for infection with H5N5 avian influenza.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq900093b6q0mu8mpw2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s the first reported case of bird flu in a human in the US in nine months and only the second reported human death from the virus in the United States, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that the risk to the general public from the virus remains low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000a3b6qsu6ummey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials continue to monitor others who were in close contact with the person, but no one else has tested positive for bird flu, and no evidence of human-to-human transmission has been found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000b3b6qvuzxqja6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The person had a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds,” the Washington State Department of Health said in &lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/grays-harbor-county-resident-dies-complications-avian-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “DOH sampling identified avian influenza virus in the environment of the flock, making exposure to the domestic poultry, their environment, or wild birds the most likely source of exposure for this patient.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000c3b6q3fi93x27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bird flu has been infecting wild birds around the world for decades, but the latest US outbreak started in January 2022 and has featured more spread among mammals than in past years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000d3b6quizvx8rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seventy other human cases of bird flu have been reported in the US as part of the outbreak, according to the CDC. Another elderly person with underlying conditions died in January after a bird flu infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000e3b6q4ia8sboo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although a handful of cases have been severe, most people who have been infected have had mild illness, the CDC said, with symptoms like red eyes and fever.  The majority of those who have caught bird flu work closely with animals. There have been 41 cases in people who work with cattle and 24 cases among poultry workers. Two other cases have had some other animal exposure that the CDC does not list, and in three cases, the exposure was unknown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000f3b6qa6ajnuy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC recommends that anyone who works closely with animals wear appropriate protective equipment and use caution around animal feces.  Officials also advise using caution when cleaning bird feeders or other areas exposed to bird feces. Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi9mldq9000g3b6qnakkdg1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Washington health department also recommends flu shots for anyone who may come into contact with domestic or wild birds. Although the regular influenza vaccine can’t protect against bird flu, it reduces the slight chance that someone could get sick with both viruses at once and cause the bird flu virus to mutate into something that would spread easily among humans.

"But that's because the body thinks an infection might be coming, so cells move into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Within hours the levels go back to normal so your body hasn't created any more white blood cells." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Riley adds that part of the benefit of cold water swimming comes from building a social connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Feeling "brighter, more alert and more connected" has real physiological effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist, says the benefits are mostly indirect and much of what makes people feel healthier in winter may come down to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It reduces stress because you're outdoors with nice people in nice places. But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Being in nature can lower your blood pressure and stress hormones that can dampen immune responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;GP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Kombucha: Interesting but little evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d78f/live/c27a67e0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Young woman drinking a refreshing beverage from a plastic bottle " class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But Dr McCartney remains cautious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present "interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Supplements: Just expensive urine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c0dc/live/c553c6a0-c748-11f0-ad8e-3f3e719de832.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Woman's hand holding colorful pills against terracotta table background with shadows from home plant.

comes to fighting off colds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She says the same goes for multi-vitamins which do very little beyond giving you "expensive urine". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, Vitamin D is slightly different as "there's theoretical evidence of a small decrease in respiratory infections". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But, she explains that not everyone will see a benefit if they take it and it's only people "with low vitamin D and pre-existing respiratory diseases" who will likely benefit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help.

vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Riley recommends the flu jab which takes from seven to 10 days after the jab to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;While you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. flu season is starting slowly, and it’s unclear if it will be as bad as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-flu-season-cdc-a640e8fe0bffa4a8f6bdbd7ea8e5608a"&gt;last winter’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but some health experts are worried as U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data posted Friday shows a new version of the virus has emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early analysis suggests current vaccines may still be somewhat effective against the new version of the flu, which has been the main driver of recent infections, CDC data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists and medical professionals are more worried about disappointing vaccination rates, a main reason why flu hospitalizations and deaths were unusually bad during last year’s flu season — one of the deadliest this century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we’re going to see a really severe season,” said Asefeh Faraz Covelli of the George Washington University School of Nursing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last winter, the overall flu hospitalization rate was the highest seen since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. Flu was the underlying or a contributing cause of more than 18,000 deaths, and one seven-day stretch early this year saw more than 1,800 deaths — the highest one-week spike in at least a decade. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-deaths-children-cdc-e79b1e4169d629ad4bc1095d95d82110"&gt;Child flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; also were far higher than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;CDC &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; posted Friday showed low flu activity so far, with only one state — Louisiana — reporting moderate activity. Most of the reported infections have been in children, said the CDC’s Alicia Budd, who tracks flu infections for the Atlanta-based agency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most also have been a new version of the type A H3N2 virus that historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. That type is responsible for most flu infections so far this year, and more than half have been a new subclade K variant that is different from the strain this year’s flu shots were built to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;A preliminary &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from the United Kingdom suggests the shots do provide at least partial protection, although it will take some time for scientists to know exactly how effective they are. Experts say any protection that softens the blow of a flu infection is important to get.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Flu seasons tend to get bad between December and February, and illnesses likely will accelerate as people travel and gather for Thanksgiving, Covelli said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s going to start picking up here,” she said. “This is the ideal time to get vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers this year have been facing an unusual struggle to get a handle on how respiratory infection and vaccination rates have been trending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They usually rely on the CDC for data, but a recent government shutdown halted data collection and reporting just as respiratory infections started ramping up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, government efforts to promote disease-preventing shots have been more limited since U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was put in charge of the CDC and other federal health agencies. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist, has fostered uncertainty about the safety of vaccines, including flu shots that contained a preservative called &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-flu-vaccine-thimerosal-c5696bbc19f345323153d5336cb5e798"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, vaccination rates against COVID-19 clearly continue to plummet, with about 6% of children and 14% of adults up to date on their shots, according to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/vaccination-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other CDC data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; posted Friday. Each figure is about 3 percentage points less than it was at this point last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;For the flu, vaccination trends are a little muddier. Some sources have suggested flu vaccinations are down. Over two million fewer flu shots were given at U.S. pharmacies through the end of October compared to last year, according to data from IQVIA, a health information and research company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the latest CDC data indicates that for children, the vaccination rate this year is about the same as it was at this point last fall, at 34%. And the vaccination rate for adults is up a few percentage points to about 37%, according to the CDC data, which relies on survey information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is early in the season and too early to know if the increase will be sustained or what is causing it, CDC officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of the beginning of November, the U.S. flu hospitalization rate is about the same as it was at the same point in 2024. Hospitalization rates for COVID-19 and another respiratory virus, RSV, are lower so far this season, according to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/resp-net/dashboard/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;another set&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;Miliary tuberculosis (MTB) is a severe form of tuberculosis in which the instigating bacteria— &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; or potentially a relative that infects cows and deer, &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&lt;/em&gt;—spread widely through the body and create small lesions. The name “miliary” dates back to 1700, when a physician noted that the specks resembled millet seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium&lt;/em&gt; can spread through the air and are often found in the lungs, the bacteria can strike anywhere in the body. Still, penile tuberculosis is exceedingly rare. In fact, it’s uncommon to have tuberculosis erupt anywhere in the urinary and genital tracts. Among the infections that spring up in the region, penile infections account for less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, given the man’s lungs and his immunosuppressed status, the unusual presentation became their leading guess—and tests soon confirmed it. &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium &lt;/em&gt;were identified in the man’s respiratory tract, and penile tissue tested also showed the bacteria, though the testing couldn’t identify what species of &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment for tuberculosis requires a regimen of several antibiotics and takes months. In the man’s case, they customized his treatment with a 12-month, four-drug regimen that wouldn’t interfere with his transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the penile lesion got worse before it got better. He developed a large necrotic ulceration on the side of his penis, and his foreskin began to “break down.” Surgeons had to mechanically cut out the dead tissue. After 10 months, his infection appeared to have cleared, and his penile lesion had improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unexplained exposure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how the man got the infection. He told doctors he wasn’t aware of coming in contact with any tuberculosis patients and wasn’t in settings where the bacteria normally spread, such as prisons. It’s possible that the bacteria had been lurking in his transplanted kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

This conclusion is supported by leading health authorities, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the California Department of Public Health, the World Health Organization, and leading research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The increase in autism diagnoses reflects improved screening, broader diagnostic criteria, and greater awareness – not a link to vaccines. The spread of this harmful myth stigmatizes members of the autism community and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 22:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9JSG1vZ1l3R25uU3o4dWtrN0xlZHFlOFFDSmNPTXZUSXg3LV9PMEc5TE5ROHdKZkFnQkFNTFhEYV9OTmdHV2l5bzFoNE5PZjUyckI2N19HM0xUc29UcW9iVU9OMDBqTzlqT3l0TmdYcWI5LU5qbmk2TVV2X2N1Zw</guid></item><item><title>减肥注射的危险和更好的替代方案- KSL.com</title><link>https://www.ksl.com/article/51408978/weight-loss-shots-research-indicates-dangers-from-starting-and-stopping</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both starting and stopping this drug can be dangerous. Not only is the research clear about this but Dr. Roberts DC, at &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Heath Utah&lt;/a&gt;, is on the front lines helping prevent and resolve side effects. He reports seeing some of the problems patients are experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such case involved a 16-year-old girl. Roberts says, "She came into my clinic with excruciating pain. She couldn't even drink water without severe abdominal distress. Even though she was on Semaglutide for only a short time, the pain persisted for six months after she stopped injecting it. That's when she came to see me. Fortunately with care, her pain resolved within a few weeks. Incredibly she lost no weight throughout the whole ordeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients aren't so lucky. Their symptoms are more severe or longer lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: N F/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Serious side effects of starting GLP-1 Agonists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/09/health/report-ozempic-and-other-weight-loss-drugs-linked-to-162-us-deaths/#:~:text=Weight%20loss%20shots%20like%20Ozempic,over%20the%20past%20six%20months" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post, since 2018, a total of 10,000 serious or life-threatening reactions have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database (FAERS).  And sadly, medical professionals and manufacturers have reported that these shots were a factor in 162 deaths. The number of these deaths rose by an astonishing 40% over a recent six month period as more and more people started using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts says, "The reality is that the risk of death while taking these drugs is probably no greater than many other very common drugs. This just underscores the general principle that there are inherent risks in taking any kind of medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9192250/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;1997 study&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately found that, more often than not, doctors fail to tell their patients about the risks. So Roberts encourages patients to take on the responsibility of informing themselves, weighing the risks and considering all their options before taking a drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a618008.html#:~:text=Semaglutide%20injection%20may%20increase%20the,swallowing;%20or%20shortness%20of%20breath" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Semaglutide label&lt;/a&gt; lists the following potential side effects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pancreatitis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thyroid tumors, including cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe gastrointestinal disease such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bloating, severe constipation, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute kidney injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hypoglycemia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gallbladder disease including Gallstones and inflammation of the gallbladder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allergic reactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid or pounding heartbeat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suicidal behavior and ideation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies have found other concerning side effects not listed on the label. The following represent a couple of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported in the journal, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, up to 60% of weight lost on Liraglutide is lean muscle mass, which can weaken physical function and slow metabolism. "That means that for every three pounds you lose, almost two of them could be from muscle," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 population study&lt;/a&gt; reported in JAMA Ophthalmology found there is approximately a threefold increased risk of a sudden vision loss called non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-trials-may-not-differentiate-data-show-women-more-2025a1000lb2?form=fpf" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2025 article&lt;/a&gt; in Medscape reported FAERS analysis found incidences of anosmia, (loss of smell), dysgeusia (altered taste), tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dysphonia (voice changes), hearing disabilities and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Kyrylo Ryzhov/Adobe Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stopping GLP-1 Agonists: Brace for weight regain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're thinking about stopping GLP-1 agonists, be prepared for what's likely to happen. Research published in Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism showed that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35441470/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;327 participants in the study&lt;/a&gt; regained two thirds of their weight within a year after discontinuing the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537024000543" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;research published in Sciencedirect&lt;/a&gt; showed that the weight people regain after the shots has a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, leading to a lowered metabolic rate and increased metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anyone coming off these drugs must understand this near-certain outcome if they want to prevent it," Roberts says. "If people coming off the medications will treat the drugs as a jump start to optimal health and weight, rather than the means to it and then take certain steps, they can maintain the weight loss and continue to lose weight if necessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Dmitry Lobanov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain weight loss after the shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The first step is to accept the fact that there is no short cut to optimal health and weight," Roberts says. "The laws of health cannot be circumvented with any kind of medication. You may have lost some weight with the shots, but it will all come back with a vengeance unless you adhere to those laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second step is to identify any underlying health issues that may be causing your stubborn weight or contributing to conditions that cause it. "Depression, insomnia, hormone imbalances, bad bacteria in the gut, liver/gallbladder problems, insulin resistance, leptin resistance, toxins and deficiencies can all contribute to both weight gain and stubborn weight," Roberts says. &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;At Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, it is the first order of business to identify these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each patient undergoes a specialized non-invasive body scan. The scan is a functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and potential underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that also can identify these underlying problems. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 30 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire. Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation with each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third step is to address all underlying health conditions through a customized protocol of care. A care plan can include therapies, supplementation, hypnotherapy, coaching and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is to create a customized, healthy and sustainable food plan. Roberts says, "The shots work partially because they reduce the calories you eat. But the shots ultimately fail, like almost every other diet, precisely because they reduce the calories you eat. Calorie reduction never works long term because your body's metabolism slows down when threatened by reduced calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Health Utah they don't cut calories, count calories, count macros or points. They don't have you cut out whole categories of food like carbs. They don't tell you to eat all meat or all fat or give you any other faddish diet. They customized your food plan according to your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take these steps and you will likely be able to maintain the weight you lost while on the shots and get healthier at the same time, something the shots could never do," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people. You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://app.gohighlevel.com/v2/preview/V4PKJFd02o0yv0Z3BF0e?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=display" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

"We don't want to say the sky is falling, so to speak, but the whole industry is jumping on this ASAP." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Joe Stricklin, a veterinarian in Greeley, Colorado, told Cowboy State Daily that "a confirmed case (of EHM) showing early neurological signs" has been confirmed in Colorado. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;That horse was exposed to the virus in Waco and later attended events in Casper and Wheatland. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;That means many Wyoming horses have, in all likelihood, already been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Stay Home'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"We're just at the tip of finding out how far and wide this virus has spread," Stricklin said. "It takes anywhere from four to 14 days for horses to start showing symptoms, so we're in that period where (infected horses) are just starting to show symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Nemetz said he's "not any way, shape, form or fashion an expert in veterinary medicine," but he urges Western horse owners to take an abundance of caution and monitor their horses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"Let's stay vigilant," he said. "We want to create awareness that these viruses are out there, and if you see any signs and symptoms in your horse, it might be worth a call to your veterinarian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin has a simple but urgent message to horse owners nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"Stay home," he said. "I'm not going to tell anyone to quit living, but this isn't a common, everyday rhinovirus. It's a variant that has some deadly potential to it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;Horses can appear perfectly healthy yet spread EHV-1. (USDA)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread, Symptoms, And Severity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Stricklin, EHV-1 and its variants are notoriously easy to spread. It doesn't take much for the virus to be transmitted from horse to horse. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"The most common method of transmission is going to be horse to horse, nose to nose," he said. "But it can also spread if one horse is shedding, if they're tied beside each other, rode in the same trailer, or drank out of the same bucket." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Humans can also spread EHV-1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The virus isn't zoonotic, so it can't infect humans, but humans can unknowingly carry and spread it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"If a horse sheds the virus onto someone's clothes, and that person goes to another horse, the virus can be transmitted to that horse," he said. "It's just like a cough or cold. Viral moisture particles can spread the virus from one horse to the next." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial symptoms of EHV-1 include nasal discharge and a fever above 101.5 degrees. Symptoms that EHV-1 has progressed into EHM include weakness and stumbling in the hind limbs, difficulty urinating or defecating, "dead tail," and dribbling urine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It progresses to the point where horses can get down and can't get up," Stricklin said. "In some cases where this variant has surfaced, horses have died within 24 hours of showing the neurological symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin described the current outbreak as "moderately serious," but he expects an increase in cases in several states over the next 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;He is already monitoring five horses in Colorado that "are either running high temps or starting with discharge from noses" after confirmed exposure to the infected horse from Waco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"The next 10 days are going to give us a huge outlook into what we can expect for the next month," he said. "If people can take it easy for the next week, we'll know if it's blowing up exponentially or we're getting it under control." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wyoming Exposed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wyo Blu Equine Vet Clinic in Wheatland reports that horses that attended barrel races at Riata Ranch in Cheyenne on Nov. 15 and J Bar C in Wheatland on Nov. 16 were exposed to at least one of the confirmed cases of EHV-1. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Horses of concern also attended a rodeo in Casper around the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin confirmed that Colorado's first confirmed case of EHM attended events in Casper and Wheatland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;It was infected at the World Championship Barrel Racing Finals in Waco, but attended the Wyoming events before showing symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"That horse started showing neurological symptoms on Thursday night," he said. "They were mild at that time, but I haven't spoken to the people treating that horse since then." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Horses exposed in Casper, Cheyenne, and Wheatland might not be showing any symptoms yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Concerned horse owners should begin looking for the initial symptoms, nasal discharge and fever, taking their horse's temperature twice a day, and contacting their local veterinarian immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nemetz said EHV-1 isn't necessarily fatal, provided it's caught and treated as soon as possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Most of these horses recover, if they receive veterinary care promptly and EHV-1 doesn't progress into EHM," he said. "It does require some strict monitoring and isolation, but as long as you can keep it EHV-1 from progressing, a lot of these horses recover and live." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cvm.missouri.edu/understanding-the-recent-equine-herpesvirus-ehv-outbreak/" title="https://cvm.missouri.edu/understanding-the-recent-equine-herpesvirus-ehv-outbreak/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;The College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Missouri&lt;/a&gt; recommends that any horse that attended the Waco event or any venue with known EHV-1/EHM cases should enter strict quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Trailers and equipment should be disinfected, and horses shouldn't be released from quarantine until 14 days after their last known exposure and a negative test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is a vaccine for EHV-1, but exposed or infected horses shouldn't be vaccinated. Non-exposed horses should receive an EHV-1 booster if they have not been vaccinated within three months. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It's not a death sentence if it's detected and treated early enough," Nemetz said. "The trick is not to let it go, or think that it's going to get better on its own. Pick up the phone, text your veterinarian, and get them out to check on that animal right away." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stricklin said the last major outbreak of EHV-1 happened in Ogden, Utah, in 2011. It spread to at least eight states and killed several horses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"It's something that people need to take seriously," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Home &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;EHV-1 outbreaks are serious, especially at large events like the World Championship Barrel Racing Finals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The key to avoiding exposures and getting the outbreak under control is to avoid or use extreme discretion when attending rodeos, horse sales, and other events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;The Billings Livestock Commission already canceled its Nov. 22 livestock sale "due to concerns" about the spread of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Stricklin encouraged horse owners to consider avoiding these events until the extent of the outbreak is better understood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"A lot of times, these horses that have been traveling a lot," he said. "After going hard all summer or all year, their immune systems get weak, so it doesn't take a lot for these horses to become infected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Another reason to stay home is the Marshall and Sterling Insurance/USHJA National Championships, held in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Nov. 10-16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Horses that were exposed to EHV-1 in Waco might have gone directly to Las Vegas, making it a potential super-spreading event for EHV-1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"I have a great concern for the events that went on in Vegas," Stricklin said. "All the horses at these events have gone in so many different directions, and we're just seeing the first round of the horses getting sick from Waco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"In another week, we're going to start seeing horses from who knows where starting to show symptoms." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;Nemetz encouraged Wyoming horse owners to exercise caution, even if it means missing a rodeo or horse show in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many upcoming events may be cancelled out of caution, but it's not worth risking your horses' health or the spread of EHV-1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;"If more positive cases surface, everyone will take a step back," he said. "I'm sure these events and sales will pick back up once we know where we stand, but this is the right time to make sure the virus doesn't continue to spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andrew Rossi can be reached at &lt;a href="mailto:arossi@cowboystatedaily.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;arossi@cowboystatedaily.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cowboy State Daily</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 21:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPeVpSZENaUG15S29NMDRCMUt4QXF3cWNFUE5SWHdQdUZPbVBpdWR6ei01a2UxLW02aGlEelRWcDJmWEoxT3I3bVpQOHlxZnNZaG1OdFY5VVY0b2NhZjNXemIxb3lrLWF3LW55cGtpN2I2N205cTBiVXN1Z0hXV2RrMzdaYTFsSDJPczM3Nmh2YkxDaDNXeEY1UUprRzN1T0d4b0ZpajJMcmZtUFdR</guid></item><item><title>福克斯新闻健康通讯：普通香料可以促进幸福和性健康-福克斯新闻</title><link>https://www.foxnews.com/health/fox-news-health-newsletter-common-spice-could-boost-happiness-sexual-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt; &lt;div id="beyondwords-wrapper" class="beyondwords-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="info"&gt;&lt;span class="label-bg"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt;You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Based on information available to date, the individual is not employed by the GSP Airport District. While we do not have additional details about the individual’s role or movements, we encourage anyone who believes they may have been exposed on November 10 or 11, to review the Department of Public Health’s guidance and follow their recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-2"&gt;“For some context, GSP Airport District employees around 250 employees. But the airport support over 2,000 jobs. There are a wide range of employers including airlines, rental cars, janitorial service, etc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;An individual was also confirmed to have attended the Way of Truth Church in Inman while infectious, DPH said.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yinging Ma, lead study author and doctoral student at The Child Health Research Center at Penn State, said: 'By just two months of age, we can already see patterns in feeding, sleep and play that may shape a child's growth trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This shows how important it is to screen early in infancy so we can support families to build healthy routines, prevent excessive weight gain and help every child get off to the best possible start.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published earlier this year in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837959"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 143 mothers and their babies who were receiving care from Geiser Health System in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-557abf40-c6ea-11f0-9690-cb2f8ffbf0b4"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; and were enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which provides food assistance for women and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mothers completed a 15-question survey about their infant's diet, sleep, playtime and appetite, as well as if caregivers fed their babies with breastmilk, formula or a combination of the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of the mothers was 26, and 70 percent were white. The majority (58 percent) of households made under $25,000 per year, which is below the poverty line for a three-person household in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At two months old, 73 percent of infants were exclusively formula-fed. Infant growth was measured once at two months and again at six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that out of 12 behavioral routines, nine that were done when infants were two months old were associated with higher BMI and weight-to-length ratios when the babies turned six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of feeding, these routines included using bottle sizes that were too big for the infant's developmental stage, feeding too often at night and mothers thinking their infants were hungry more often than they actually were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under the sleeping category, the four routines that led to higher weight were going to bed after 8pm, waking up more than twice at night, being put to bed while already asleep instead of drowsy and sleeping in a room with a TV playing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Southern states are more at risk of high death rates from heart disease, the latest data from the CDC shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for playtime, babies with higher BMIs were more likely to have parents who used their phone or watched TV during playtime and those who had limited active play or tummy time, when an infant spends time on their stomach to strengthen their upper body muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overfeeding infants, along with sedentary habits and a lack of physical activity, causes them to pack on weight. Poor sleep has been shown to increase levels of the hormone ghrelin, which stimulates appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear if the infants in the study remained overweight later in life, research shows early infancy is a key window that determines obesity risk. The first six months of an infant's life determine metabolism, or how well the body is able to turn food into energy. Slower metabolism burns fewer calories, causing them to be stored as excess fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This slow metabolism early in life can cause infants to have bigger appetites as they grow up and more fat mass, leading to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Affecting three in four Americans, overweight or obesity are primary risk factors for developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team hopes to expand their research and look at families with a wider range of socioeconomic backgrounds, as the new study largely focused on low-income households.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jennifer Savage Williams, senior study author and professor and director of The Child Health Research Center at Penn State, said: 'With the limited time available during pediatric and nutrition visits, it's essential to help providers focus on what matters most for each family.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy isn’t something we usually associate with specific geographic regions, but new research suggests that’s an oversight—at least in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research finds that certain parts of the U.S. have much higher rates of epilepsy than others. Researchers examined the Medicare data of Americans over 65 from across the country. Older adults were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with a new case of epilepsy if they lived in the southeastern U.S., they found. The findings suggest that this region might have unique risk factors that contribute to the neurological condition, such as hotter weather or larger health care disparities, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Modifiable social and environmental conditions at the local level may contribute to epilepsy incidence among older adults and could help guide targeted prevention efforts,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2841156"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The epilepsy belt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/epilepsy-and-seizures"&gt;disorder&lt;/a&gt; characterized by surges of unusual electrical activity in the brain, which then causes recurring seizures. There are many different causes and forms of epilepsy, but it’s known that certain groups of people are more likely to develop it, including older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While previous research has shown that the prevalence of diagnosed epilepsy can differ between various regions of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00302-5/fulltext"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214035"&gt;the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., the scientists behind the new study say theirs is the first to map how often epilepsy affects older Americans at a national level.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers are from the Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas and Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. They analyzed Medicare claims data from 2016 to 2019, focusing on epilepsy cases newly diagnosed in 2019. All told, there were about 20,000 cases diagnosed that year. And the incidence rate of epilepsy varied significantly between regions of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The highest rates were found in southeastern states like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The researchers also identified various factors that seemed to be correlated with epilepsy in the states along this “epilepsy belt”—as the researchers have dubbed it. Rates of insufficient sleep were higher in Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia, for instance; southern states also had more days of extreme heat during the year (a heat index above 95 degrees); and states like Texas and Florida had higher uninsurance rates (younger people without insurance are less likely to see a doctor, which could then delay a timely diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some of these factors are thought to clearly increase epilepsy risk, like poor sleep, others have received less attention as potential causes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is the first study documenting such a strong association between extreme heat and incident epilepsy in older adults across the U.S., highlighting the importance of climate change in emergency preparedness, especially given the graying of the population,” said study researcher Siran Koroukian, professor in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/newsroom/discovering-america-s-epilepsy-belt-first-of-its-kind-national-study-reveals-us-regions-with-high/"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Notably, this same region of the U.S. is also known to have higher rates of stroke, which has led researchers to call it the “&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.119.024155"&gt;stroke belt&lt;/a&gt;“. Since strokes are yet another major risk factor of epilepsy, that too is likely playing a part in causing new cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Areas of improvement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that about 3 million American adults are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;living with epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;. And while the condition isn’t currently curable in most cases, it can be effectively treated with medications, surgery, and managing potential triggers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers hope their findings can help improve efforts on epilepsy prevention and mitigation through various public health interventions in the areas of the country where people’s risk is highest.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These may include improving sleep health, enhancing heat resilience, and reducing transportation and insurance-related barriers to care,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Iowa's most recent Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report shows the virus at a very low level of activity, and hospitals are currently reporting low patient admission rates. Although flu activity in Iowa is currently low, officials say Iowans can take precautions to keep themselves and their families healthy throughout the respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three studies published in one of the most respected medical journals paint a vivid picture of how ultra-processed foods are wreaking havoc on global health. Their packaging is bright, their claims are bold, but strip away the marketing, and what remains is not exactly food. It’s more like an industrial formulation that mimics food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, ultra-processed foods (UPFs) &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2024/ultraprocessed-foods-account-for-more-than-half-of-calories-consumed-at-home"&gt;account for over half of adult calories&lt;/a&gt;, and over 60% of children’s calories. Many other countries &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8398521/"&gt;have comparable figures&lt;/a&gt;, so UPFs are on the rise almost everywhere. And according to the world’s largest scientific review on the subject, these products are now linked to harm in every major organ system of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-just-burgers-and-sodas"&gt;Not Just Burgers and Sodas&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s no simple, straightforward definition of ultra-processed foods, even though they’re so widespread. They’re foods that usually have a lot of ingredients and are prepared through methods that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6389637/"&gt;we couldn’t do ourselves at home&lt;/a&gt;. They’re often very rich in salt and sugar, as well as plenty of additives. They also typically have unnatural textures and are ready to eat or just need heating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists use something called the “Nova” system to classify UPFs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Nova group 1 you have basic things like apples, uncooked rice, or fish. These are &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/most-ultra-processed-food-is-bad-but-there-are-some-big-exceptions/"&gt;unprocessed or minimally processed&lt;/a&gt;. On the other end, you have Nova group 4: &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/8-everyday-foods-you-might-not-realise-are-ultra-processed-and-how-to-spot-them/"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;. These are the sodas, the packaged snacks, the reconstituted meat nuggets, and the breakfast cereals that never go stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30744710/"&gt;Carlos Monteiro&lt;/a&gt;, Brazilian epidemiologist who coined the term ultra-processed food and introduced the Nova classification, argues in the new study that UPFs have &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/eating-more-ultra-processed-foods-tied-to-increased-risk-of-early-onset-colorectal-cancer/"&gt;fundamentally different chemical structures&lt;/a&gt; than “regular” food. He and his colleagues focus on something called the food matrix.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you eat something like a fruit or a whole almond, your body has to work to break down the cell walls to access the fats and nutrients. This is the “food matrix.” It slows digestion and sends satiety signals to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs destroy that matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing process breaks down raw ingredients into molecular slurry, then reconstructs them using emulsifiers, texturizers, and artificial flavors. The result is something referred to as “hyper-palatable.” It melts in your mouth so fast your brain never gets the signal to stop eating. That’s a big reason why UPFs are so bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The consequences are visible in the data: over 100 prospective studies link these foods to adverse outcomes in nearly all organ systems, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="upfs-took-over-the-world"&gt;UPFs Took Over the World&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How did we reach a point where 50% of the average diet consists of these industrial products?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to blame consumers. These foods are tastier, more palatable (by definition), and oftentimes, cheaper. Oftentimes, we know they’re &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/ultra-processed-foods-made-healthy-young-men-gain-fat-and-lose-sperm-quality-in-just-three-weeks/"&gt;not as healthy&lt;/a&gt; and we still buy them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/13/the-guardian-view-on-ultra-processed-food-blame-business-not-consumers"&gt;deeply unfair&lt;/a&gt; to put consumers at the center of the problem. It wasn’t an accident. It was a business model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third paper in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; series drops a bombshell, comparing the &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/tobacco-company-smuggling-03092018/"&gt;food industry’s tactics&lt;/a&gt; directly to the &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/nutrition-medicine/tobacco-companies-were-big-in-promoting-junk-food-in-america/"&gt;tobacco industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;UPFs are significantly more profitable than fresh food. They have a long shelf life and use cheap ingredients like soy protein isolate and high-fructose corn syrup. To protect these profits, the industry has deployed a “corporate political activity” playbook.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rough idea is that they lobby governments to block any regulation that would push for healthier food (and people) at the expense of their product. They fund research to manufacture doubt about the science. They infiltrate health agencies. The authors note that the industry has created a “global network of front groups” to ensure that policy debates focus on individual choice rather than corporate culpability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-how-do-we-reclaim-our-plates"&gt;So, How Do We Reclaim Our Plates?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second paper in the series outlines a policy roadmap, and the message is clear: we need to treat UPF like the public health crisis it is. Otherwise, obesity will continue to worsen, along with all the other problems associated with unhealthy diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’re in the same position with food that we were with cigarettes in the 1960s. The evidence is mounting, but the regulation is lagging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors call for aggressive moves. We need to ban the marketing of UPFs to children. We need to remove these products from schools and hospitals. And we need clear warning labels — not just about calories, but about the level of processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that sounds really hard, well, it is. But it’s not impossible. Look at Brazil, for instance. Their national school food program has eliminated most UPFs. By 2026, they will require 90% of the food served in schools to be fresh or minimally processed. They proved that government policy can prioritize health over corporate profit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we wait for policy to catch up, you have to be your own defense system. Some simple things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore the front of the package.&lt;/strong&gt; The health claims are marketing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;. If you see ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen — emulsifiers, protein isolates, high-fructose corn syrup — it’s likely ultra-processed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the matrix.&lt;/strong&gt; Eat foods that look like they grew out of the ground, not foods that were born in a factory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Current treatments cannot cure the condition. Although antibody-based drugs targeting amyloid β (Aβ) have recently become available, their benefits remain modest. These therapies can also be expensive and may trigger immune-related side effects, underscoring the need for safer, low-cost options that are easier for patients to access.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Neurochemistry International&lt;/em&gt; reports that researchers from Kindai University and partner institutions found that oral arginine, a naturally occurring amino acid that acts as a safe chemical chaperone, can markedly reduce Aβ aggregation and its toxic effects in animal models of AD. The team noted that although arginine is sold as a dietary supplement, the dose and schedule used in their experiments were designed for research and do not match commercial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was led by Graduate Student Kanako Fujii and Professor Yoshitaka Nagai from the Department of Neurology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka, along with Associate Professor Toshihide Takeuchi from the Life Science Research Institute, Kindai University, Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laboratory and Animal Tests Show Strong Anti-Amyloid Activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; experiments demonstrated that arginine slows the formation of Aβ42 aggregates in a concentration-dependent fashion. Building on this evidence, the researchers tested oral arginine in two widely used AD models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; model, expressing Aβ42 with the Arctic mutation (E22G)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;An &lt;em&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;knock-in mouse model, carrying three familial AD mutations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both systems, arginine treatment led to a significant drop in Aβ buildup and reduced the harmful effects associated with Aβ exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study demonstrates that arginine can suppress Aβ aggregation both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;," explains Prof. Nagai. "What makes this finding exciting is that arginine is already known to be clinically safe and inexpensive, making it a highly promising candidate for repositioning as a therapeutic option for AD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits Extend Beyond Amyloid Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mouse model, oral arginine lowered amyloid plaque formation and reduced insoluble Aβ42 levels in the brain. Mice receiving arginine also performed better in behavioral assessments and showed decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes linked to neuroinflammation, a key contributor to AD progression. These results indicate that arginine's benefits may involve not only preventing aggregation but also providing broader neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings open up new possibilities for developing arginine-based strategies for neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein misfolding and aggregation," notes Prof. Nagai. "Given its excellent safety profile and low cost, arginine could be rapidly translated to clinical trials for Alzheimer's and potentially other related disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repurposing Existing Compounds for Alzheimer's Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the advantages of drug repositioning, a strategy that repurposes existing safe compounds for new therapeutic uses. Because arginine is already approved for clinical use in Japan and shows good brain permeability, it may bypass multiple early hurdles that often slow traditional drug development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that additional preclinical and clinical studies are essential to confirm whether these effects will translate to humans and to determine appropriate dosing strategies. Even so, the results present strong proof of concept that basic nutritional or pharmacological supplementation could reduce amyloid pathology and improve neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Cost-Effective Approach With Global Potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common health problems of old age -- dehydration, delirium, malnutrition or falls -- can become catastrophic if they occur following a major surgery, a new study reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who suffer these issues while recovering from surgery are more likely to die within a year, and will require more time in hospitals or nursing facilities, researchers reported Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/journalacs/abstract/9900/new_onset_geriatric_syndromes_among_patients.1441.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American College of Surgeons&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A geriatric syndrome can be a 'canary in the coal mine,' signaling a patient's underlying vulnerability," senior researcher &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/search-physician-directory/timothy-m-pawlik" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Timothy Pawlik&lt;/a&gt;, a surgical oncologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's crucial we don't dismiss these events as just a normal part of 'getting older.' These are important warning signs that a patient needs closer monitoring and tailored support, both in the hospital and after discharge," Pawlik said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed Medicare claims data for more than 780,000 patients older than 66 who underwent one of five major operations between 2016 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operations included coronary artery bypass, lung removal, repair of an artery aneurysm in the abdomen, removal of the pancreas or removal of part of the colon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 11% of patients developed at least one new geriatric syndrome during their hospitalization -- delirium, dehydration, malnutrition, falls or loss of bladder or bowel control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dehydration was the most common problem, affecting 67% of patients, followed by delirium (25%) and malnutrition (13%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients who developed one of these health problems of old age were far less likely to be discharged directly home. They spent a median of 16 fewer days at home in the three months following surgery -- 27% less than those who didn't develop a geriatric syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who developed any one of the problems also had a doubled risk of death within one year. That death risk more than tripled if a person developed two or more geriatric syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who were older and had other existing health problems were more likely to develop a post-surgical geriatric syndrome, researchers found. The risk also was higher if they needed emergency surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, minimally invasive procedures were associated with a 49% lower risk of developing a geriatric syndrome, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings show that it's important to approach surgery for older people differently, researchers said, by taking into account their medical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By focusing on the unique needs of older patients, we can better anticipate, prevent, and manage these syndromes, which directly translates to helping patients get back home and back to their lives," Pawlik said.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chopping and lightly stir-frying your broccoli may increase the amount of a specific antioxidant, called sulforaphane, thereby maximizing the health benefits you get from the vegetable, research suggests.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The paper, published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;, raises the question of whether there are “right” and “wrong” ways to cook broccoli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that cooking inhibits another enzyme called myrosinase, which is essential for sulforaphane production. Therefore, longer, harsher cooking methods result in a greater reduction in sulforaphane levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It is widely known that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/raw-vs-cooked-vegetables-11812062" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prolonged cooking can degrade nutrients&lt;/a&gt; in broccoli, including sulforaphane,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephani-johnson-rdn-dcn-88856120/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Stephani Johnson, RDN, DCN&lt;/a&gt;, adjunct professor in the department of clinical and preventive nutrition services at the Rutgers School of Health Professions, told Verywell.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that lightly stir-frying broccoli actually helped decrease the activity of myrosinase during the cooking process, which translates to higher levels of sulforaphane on your plate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, researchers found that chopping broccoli into florets about 90 minutes before lightly stir-frying it was associated with the highest levels of sulforaphane.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This is likely because chopping activates myrosinase, facilitating the conversion of glucoraphanin to sulforaphane before the enzyme is deactivated by heat,” Johnson said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study is limited in that the authors didn’t look at how other forms of preparation—such as microwaving or steaming—affect the sulforaphane levels in broccoli.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Despite this limitation, the findings suggest that preparation techniques, such as pre-cutting and light cooking, play a significant role in maximizing the health benefits of broccoli,” Johnson said.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sulforaphane is a naturally occurring compound found in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/green-vegetables-7975333" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cruciferous vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and kale, and it’s been linked to multiple health benefits, Johnson said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Broccoli is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/high-fiber-vegetables-11704101" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which supports digestive health, and it is packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/broccoli-sprouts-11842634" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;powerful antioxidants like sulforaphane&lt;/a&gt;, lutein, and zeaxanthin,” she added.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But while some preparation styles come with extra perks, &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/walmart-broccoli-recall-listeria-8767927" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broccoli&lt;/a&gt;, in any form, is good for you. “Regardless of how it’s prepared, broccoli remains a low-calorie food rich in fiber, making it a valuable addition to a healthy diet,” Johnson said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though the study might inspire you to change up your &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/healthiest-vegetables-8415670" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetable&lt;/a&gt; routine from time to time, you shouldn’t stop eating broccoli the way you like it, even if it doesn’t provide the highest possible amount of sulforaphane, experts said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If raw broccoli sounds good to you, that’s a perfectly good reason to eat it, Johnson said. “Ultimately, eating broccoli in any form is better than not eating it at all, but raw or lightly cooked preparations are generally the best options for maximizing its health-promoting properties.”

While mitigation measures such as hunting may help slow its spread, it can't be stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because cervids are ubiquitous and free ranging, the interval from infection to symptom onset can take years, and prions spread easily from animal to animal and through environmental contamination, which can persist for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnston's daughter, Kristal Enter, 39, a fundraiser in Boston, is familiar with CWD and its potential implications for human health. "Seeing what my mom went through, I do not want anyone else to have to experience that, nor their family members," she told CIDRAP News. "The more we're on top of chronic wasting disease and thinking about it, the better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the frightening thing is that, for well over a month during the recent US government shutdown, no one was watching the human disease landscape for CWD, a highly infectious disease with no treatment or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;If cases slip by, it will be too late&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nine days after the government shutdown began, all four staff members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Prion and Public Health Office were sent home after receiving reduction-in-force (RIF) notices. While the end of the shutdown led all four to be reinstated through at least January, layoffs after that time are possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within the past few months, two other researchers who had been part of the team also had to be let go after their fellowship contracts weren't renewed, per the administration's policy of blocking contract renewals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prion unit, which monitors the nation for human prion diseases, is part of the Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. It launched in the mid-1990s in response to the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or "mad cow disease") in UK cattle. BSE prions were inadvertently consumed by people who ate contaminated beef, causing the human form of BSE, variant CJD (vCJD). All infected people—more than 230—died. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The initial goal of the Prion and Public Health Office was to watch for any cases of vCJD in the US population. Since then, its focus has expanded to include advising hospitals on how to prevent and respond to prion contamination of instruments used in neurosurgery (prions are resistant to many usual sterilization methods), as well as working with state health departments on disease surveillance. Unit members also answer questions from the public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, as CWD continues its inexorable march across the landscape, exposing more and more people, the prion unit's priority is conducting surveillance for signs of a CWD species jump into high-risk people such as hunters. Without this expertise, no one will be able to evaluate whether a suspected case of CWD prion transmission to humans is likely from an animal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The prion unit has launched several epidemiologic studies in collaboration with multiple states to look at whether more hunters are dying of prion diseases than would be expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As an example of the unit's work, last spring, a cluster of CJD cases in Oregon was widely conjectured to be linked to CWD. Such cases require autopsy and an epidemiologic investigation to determine whether CWD was involved and, if so, what kind of public health measures are needed. The prion unit shared ideas and strategy with the Oregon state health department in this investigation, which, thankfully, found no link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But experts say that without anyone looking for these deviations from normal—particularly given that signs of illness may take years to appear—cases could easily go unnoticed, and it will be too late to implement public health measures that could mitigate some of these consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lawrence Schonberger, MD, MPH, retired chief of the Prion and Public Health Office, said that, as was the situation with BSE, CWD containment efforts must continue. "Unlike with mad cow disease, however, these efforts to date have not been successful," he said. Surveillance and research "should continue to help people recognize any emerging risk to humans from this agent now and in the future, when this agent's pathogenicity [ability to cause disease] may change."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Worst time to get rid of such a division'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brian Appleby, MD, is director of the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western University, which conducts diagnostic testing for human prion diseases and conducted Johnston's autopsy. The CDC funds the center, which collaborates with the Prion and Public Health Office on public health efforts and research projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To vape or not to vape?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That is the question sparking a heated debate this week in Geneva where over 1,400 delegates have gathered to discuss the World Health Organization's Tobacco Control Treaty and what they call "the tobacco epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/788597890/new-study-offers-first-evidence-of-vapings-long-term-risks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; warning about the dangers of vapes, also known as e-cigarettes, and other non-cigarette products like heated tobacco and nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many scientists and public health experts point out that the tobacco industry promotes and profits from these newer products and that many young non-smokers are using e-cigarettes and becoming addicted to nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, a number of doctors, scientists and public health experts argue that, while these products are dangerous, they may not be as dangerous as traditional cigarettes, which &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tobacco" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kill up to half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of long-term users. As the lesser of two evils, their argument goes, e-cigarettes could be useful in helping people quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This matters because even though smoking rates have been dropping, 1.2 billion people worldwide continue to use tobacco. About 80% of them live in low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Accusations of industry influence and scientific censorship are flying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO staked out its stance on the issue this month in a strongly worded &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; slamming the idea of using e-cigarettes as a tool in smoking cessation. And at the anti-tobacco gathering in Geneva, leaders are calling for tough new restrictions on products like vapes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both sides agree that getting this question right now is key to addressing the tobacco epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mea culpa!"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, Dr. Derek Yach was well regarded in the public health world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The South African physician played a leading role in drafting and launching WHO's landmark tobacco treaty. And the treaty has played a critical role in reducing tobacco use, which has dropped by a third largely due to strategies like health warnings, taxation and bans on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But now? Yach acknowledges he's a pariah to many former colleagues. "I'm excommunicated," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because of his stance on e-cigarettes, heated tobacco and the like.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach has come to believe that the traditional approach to smoking cessation is insufficient. "There was only one message allowed and still is today: The only way to get rid of smoking is to get everybody to quit," he says, arguing that this approach doesn't "recognize the toughness that people go through with a complex addiction, which is driven by nicotine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In many other areas of medicine, the idea of "harm reduction" is well established. For example, public health programs provide sterile needles to drug users so they don't spread HIV and hepatitis. It reduces the harm, even if it doesn't solve the addiction. Yach sees e-cigarettes as a method of harm reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While products like e-cigarettes still have nicotine, it is not burned. Instead, a heating element converts a nicotine liquid into a vapor that is inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's in the process of burning that you create the cancer-causing agents and many of the other toxins that eventually cause the death and disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach wants to see these products promoted by doctors and health programs as a way to help current smokers cut back on smoking or quit altogether. He remembers thinking to himself: "Mea culpa! I've missed what is probably the greatest opportunity to save lives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yach eventually founded the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World, to advocate for this approach. It's since been renamed Global Action to End Smoking and is under new leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's an important point to note about this group. It's funded by the tobacco industry. That connection has cemented his self-described excommunication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Yach is not a lone voice. &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/using-e-cigarettes-to-stop-smoking/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The U.K&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.'s National Health Service, for example, has embraced e-cigarettes as a way to help people stop smoking. And a number of academics — independent of the tobacco industry — have come to agree with him. Mike Cummings, a professor and researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Cummings does not want non-smokers to use e-cigarettes or the other products — but he also stresses that "for somebody who is already addicted to nicotine in cigarettes, having an alternative that would be safer, like an e-cigarette, is something that's worth considering."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because of his call for a debate, Cummings says, he's been shunned by many in the world of tobacco control. He says the fact that he's testified against tobacco companies in court more than 200 times hasn't saved him from being on the outs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One of the ways they have attacked us is to claim that we're shills for the cigarette companies, which is absurd. We're not," Cummings says. "Many of us are legitimate scientists."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says an open debate hasn't happened yet — and that it can be hard to get funding for research into smoking harm reduction strategies. "That's not science. That's anti-science. It's censorship," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the largest tobacco companies, Phillip Morris International, declined an interview request from NPR but said in a statement that WHO shouldn't fear dialogue and is out of step with governments that are embracing smoke-free products in order to end smoking.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Mass marketing harmful products"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the idea of harm reduction, WHO is adamant in its opposition. Its &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-position-on-tobacco-control-and-harm-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;position paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says the tobacco industry is "misappropriating" the medical term harm reduction and "mass marketing harmful products" while "cloaking" it in medical language.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Let's be clear, the companies that make these products are not motivated by harm reduction or health, they are motivated by one thing and one thing only: generating profit," says WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "There is no evidence of their net benefit for public health, but mounting evidence of their harm."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One major concern in this debate is that the products are often used by non-smokers — especially young ones who are attracted by the flavors and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We see use rates [of e-cigarettes] among children nine times higher than among adults," says Benn McGrady. He heads Public Health Law and Policies at WHO, which helps governments develop and defend tobacco laws. "The latest data that we have shows there are 15 million children worldwide using e-cigarettes."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McGrady worries that, without proper regulations, there could be a generation of people newly addicted to nicotine. WHO argues that countries need to regulate the products at least as strictly as cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last month, the International Pediatric Association also came out forcefully against e-cigarettes, warning in the medical journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/156/5/e2025072337/204538/E-Cigarettes-and-the-Nicotine-Epidemic-Statement?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;/a&gt;"e-cigarette use is associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, oral diseases and cancer, with dual users facing greater health risks than cigarette smokers alone." The stakes, their position paper says, are high: "E-cigarettes threaten to reverse decades of progress in tobacco control."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's the opposite of harm reduction, right? That's really harm-causing," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stella.bialous" target="_blank"&gt;Stella Bialous&lt;/a&gt;, the associate director for Global Tobacco Control Initiatives at the University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One concern that's surfaced has been &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/07/16/disposable-e-cigarettes-study" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exposure to metals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — like lead — in the heating element of the e-cigarette. However, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41254430/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have pointed in both &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38411454/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;directions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to exactly how risky these new products are, McGrady says, there's huge variation between the various products and it's "not responsible" to generalize. These products are relatively new and WHO's report acknowledges their risks will only become clear over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"An unutterable scam"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some, this debate feels like déjà vu — and a classic example of the tobacco industry interfering in public health efforts and sowing division.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bialous says many researchers believe that this debate is "actually one of the strategies that a tobacco company developed to divide and conquer — like 'let's talk about harm reduction and get all the people fighting among themselves while we continue to sell the products.'"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim McAfee is the former head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health — which has now been eliminated by President Trump. He says this current battle reminds him of when the industry promoted filtered cigarettes as safer in the 1950s and when they pushed low-tar cigarettes in the '60s and '70s.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every single one of those things they've done over the last 100 years has turned out to be an unutterable scam," he says. He calls the effort to promote e-cigarettes and similar products a smokescreen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cummings, the professor at Medical University of South Carolina, counters that just because these newer products are backed by the tobacco industry doesn't automatically mean they can't play a role in smoking reduction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We ought to get the evidence and weigh it and debate it — and help guide the policies based on evidence, not on ideology," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The persistent hum, hiss, or ring of &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus&lt;/strong&gt;—often described as a phantom sound—is not just a sensory glitch. For more than &lt;strong&gt;250 million people globally&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s an unrelenting companion that reshapes daily life. From mild irritation to full-blown sleep disruption and anxiety, the condition is often treated as untouchable: poorly understood, difficult to diagnose, and impossible to cure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that assumption is beginning to shift. New research from the &lt;strong&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/strong&gt; has unearthed a surprising connection between tinnitus and one of the body’s most fundamental systems: &lt;strong&gt;sleep&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, the patterns of neural activity that drive deep sleep may also act as a natural suppressor of tinnitus-related brain signals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the center of this research is a radical reframe of tinnitus—not as a static condition of the ear, but as a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic brain state&lt;/strong&gt; that shifts depending on the body’s internal rhythms. That premise could open the door to a new class of therapies rooted not in external interventions, but in the body’s own architecture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Sleep, the Brain’s Quiet Regulator&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;, focus on &lt;strong&gt;non-REM (NREM) sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, the phase characterized by &lt;strong&gt;slow-wave brain activity&lt;/strong&gt; critical for cognitive recovery. These deep-sleep rhythms appear to directly counteract the &lt;strong&gt;hyperactive neuronal firing&lt;/strong&gt; linked to tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcac089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; and a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-is-somehow-linked-to-a-crucial-bodily-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;animal study&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;em&gt;Linus Milinski&lt;/em&gt; of Oxford’s Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute, researchers observed &lt;strong&gt;ferrets&lt;/strong&gt; after exposure to loud noise. Those that developed tinnitus also showed &lt;strong&gt;disrupted sleep patterns&lt;/strong&gt; and signs of &lt;strong&gt;overactive brain responses&lt;/strong&gt; to sound stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We could actually see these sleep problems appear at the same time as tinnitus after noise exposure,” Milinski said. “This suggested, for the first time, a clear link between developing tinnitus and disrupted sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During episodes of &lt;strong&gt;deep NREM sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, the abnormal hyperactivity in the auditory cortex was significantly dampened. When the animals remained awake or slept lightly, the tinnitus-related signals persisted—indicating that &lt;strong&gt;sleep may suppress or modulate tinnitus activity&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another study from South China University of Technology, cited by Milinski in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tinnitus-is-somehow-linked-to-a-crucial-bodily-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/a&gt;, found similar patterns in human participants. Researchers noted that individuals with tinnitus were &lt;strong&gt;less able to suppress brain hyperactivity&lt;/strong&gt; as they transitioned into sleep. During deep sleep, however, the abnormal activity was markedly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Neurological Loop With No off Switch&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of these findings go far beyond the lab. Clinical evidence supports a pattern that tinnitus and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/he-vanished-into-a-cave-for-63-days-and-came-out-with-a-groundbreaking-discovery-that-redefined-science/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="78236" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; frequently &lt;strong&gt;co-occur&lt;/strong&gt;—and may &lt;strong&gt;reinforce each other&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study published in the &lt;em&gt;International Archives of Otorhinolaryngology&lt;/em&gt; examined patients with chronic tinnitus and found that over &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1735455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;72% rated their sleep quality as poor&lt;/a&gt;. More than a quarter experienced &lt;strong&gt;moderate insomnia&lt;/strong&gt;, and a significant correlation was found between &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus severity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sleep disruption&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another independent study in &lt;em&gt;Medicine (Baltimore)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000040303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; similar findings: patients with more severe tinnitus experienced &lt;strong&gt;greater insomnia symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;, although no strong link was found to daytime sleepiness or risk of sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep.jpeg" alt="Topographic Overlap Of Brain Areas Involved In Tinnitus And Nrem Sleep" class="wp-image-96181" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep.jpeg 520w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/topographic-overlap-of-brain-areas-involved-in-tinnitus-and-nrem-sleep-380x159.jpeg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topographic overlap of brain areas involved in tinnitus and NREM sleep&lt;em&gt;. Credit: Milinski et al., Brain Comms., 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to Milinski, “Tinnitus can make sleep worse, and poor sleep may, in turn, make tinnitus worse. It may be a kind of vicious circle, although I do not believe it is unbreakable.” This quote is taken directly from &lt;a href="https://rnid.org.uk/hearing-research/silencing-tinnitus/how-does-sleep-affect-tinnitus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RNID’s research page&lt;/a&gt;, where Milinski outlines the research goals and early findings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea that &lt;strong&gt;tinnitus may represent “local wakefulness” during sleep&lt;/strong&gt;—a state where certain brain regions remain active while others are shut down—has also been proposed in a &lt;a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/news/a-role-of-sleep-in-tinnitus-identified-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Oxford’s Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics. This mismatched brain state may prevent restorative deep sleep and allow tinnitus-related activity to persist, even as most of the brain rests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reframing Tinnitus as a Brain Rhythm Disorder&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, tinnitus has been viewed through a peripheral lens—as a consequence of &lt;strong&gt;ear damage&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;age-related hearing loss&lt;/strong&gt;. But the research now points to a more central problem: &lt;strong&gt;cortical hyperactivity&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in the &lt;strong&gt;auditory cortex&lt;/strong&gt;, driven by abnormal neural feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;iframe title="What does tinnitus sound like? Ringing, crackling, buzzing examples" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgIrfiyK4x8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This aligns with a broader theory in neuroscience that &lt;strong&gt;phantom percepts&lt;/strong&gt; like tinnitus stem from &lt;strong&gt;dysregulated spontaneous activity&lt;/strong&gt; in the brain. In this framework, tinnitus is not just a reaction to silence but a &lt;strong&gt;maladaptive brain prediction&lt;/strong&gt;, continually generating sound in the absence of real stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oxford-led review in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt; introduces a new model: by amplifying or supporting &lt;strong&gt;deep sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, it may be possible to &lt;strong&gt;interrupt this pathological loop&lt;/strong&gt; and rebalance the brain’s auditory pathways. The researchers propose that enhancing &lt;strong&gt;slow-wave activity&lt;/strong&gt;, either naturally or through non-invasive neurostimulation, could become a &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic pathway&lt;/strong&gt; for future treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Timing and Intervention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If confirmed through large-scale studies, these insights could change how tinnitus is treated—and when. Milinski and his team believe that &lt;strong&gt;early intervention&lt;/strong&gt;—in the hours or days after tinnitus onset—could prevent it from becoming chronic, particularly if sleep is supported during this period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Widening the scope in tinnitus research towards the brain’s natural dynamics will provide fruitful ground for understanding those of pathological nature,” Milinski said in &lt;a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/news/a-role-of-sleep-in-tinnitus-identified-for-the-first-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxford’s official research statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Future research will aim to identify &lt;strong&gt;neurophysiological markers&lt;/strong&gt; of tinnitus during sleep and test methods to reinforce deep-sleep brain activity. The goal is not just to mask tinnitus, but to &lt;strong&gt;interrupt the brain’s faulty feedback loop&lt;/strong&gt; at its source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For me, swimming is all about freedom and weightlessness,” says Ella Foote, editor of &lt;em&gt;Outdoor Swimming Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, the world’s only print publication dedicated entirely to open-water swimming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Foote is passionate about swimming outdoors, especially in the United Kingdom’s chilly waters.“Winter can feel dull and lifeless here,” she admits. “But since I’ve started swimming outside year-round, I see it differently. It’s become a way to connect with nature, even in the cold.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout the cold months, Ella makes a point to swim at least once a week. That consistency, she notes, makes all the difference. “It’s like going to the gym; if you go often, you start to love it. But if you only do it occasionally, you just end up wondering why anyone would.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;happens to your body when you plunge into freezing water? Why does something so unpleasant turn into such a satisfying high afterward? Turns out, there’s some real science behind that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-science-of-the-cold-plunge"&gt;The Science of the Cold Plunge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you first jump into cold water, whether it’s a plunge, a shower, or a swim, your body experiences what’s called the &lt;em&gt;cold shock response&lt;/em&gt;,” explains &lt;a href="https://brocku.ca/applied-health-sciences/kinesiology/faculty-research/faculty-directory/stephen-sau-shing-cheung-ph-d/"&gt;Dr. Stephen Sau-Shing Cheung&lt;/a&gt;, from Brock University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This happens when your skin temperature suddenly drops from warm to cold. It triggers your fight-or-flight response, preparing your body for action,” he told &lt;em&gt;ZME Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cheung notes that the sympathetic nervous system activates aggressively, flooding your body with adrenaline. It is the same kind of intense physiological arousal you would experience if you were suddenly startled or injured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1140x760.jpg 1140w,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k.webp 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1024x683.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-750x500.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/11695784843_9973537b3b_k.jpg 2047w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-294051 sp-no-webp" alt="" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image credits: David Bledsoe.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, this response is more than just an adrenaline rush; it can be a critical, even life-threatening event, particularly for people with underlying heart conditions. From a medical perspective, your body quickly shifts to a faster heart rate, higher blood pressure, and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This creates a physiological paradox known as “autonomic conflict.” The cold shock triggers a signal to accelerate the heart (tachycardia), while the ‘diving response’ sends a powerful ‘brake’ signal to slow the heart down. This conflict places the heart in an unstable state and can cause severe cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). In rare cases, it can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3459038/"&gt;cause sudden cardiac death&lt;/a&gt;, even in young, fit, and healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in many cases, and especially for swimmers like Ella, that physiological jolt comes with mental and emotional benefits. “If I swim on a winter morning, I’m more productive, I sleep better, and I’m generally in a better mood,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s even more encouraging, she adds, is that you don’t have to spend long in freezing water to feel the effects. “Just a couple of minutes, two to five, really, is enough to get most of the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Cheung insists there isn’t any solid scientific evidence to support many of the purported long-term physiological health benefits. Furthermore, the cold plunge is very risky for the uninitiated and unhabituated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you have a known heart condition or poor circulation, it’s important to be cautious,” Dr. Cheung warns. “At the very least, check with your doctor first and get a physical before trying it, because it does put stress on the heart, especially if you already have an underlying issue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="your-body-on-cold-water"&gt;Your Body on Cold Water&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boxing_Day_Swimming_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1093200.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boxing_Day_Swimming_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1093200.webp " type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boxing_Day_Swimming_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1093200.jpg" class="wp-image-294052 sp-no-webp" alt="" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image via Wiki Commons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if there are risks, why do people like Ella report feeling so good? The answer lies in &lt;a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Hormesis"&gt;a process known as hormesis&lt;/a&gt;, where a low-dose, acute stressor induces beneficial, adaptive responses that enhance resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For starters, repeated, controlled exposures (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9467574/"&gt;as few as&lt;/a&gt; six 3-minute immersions) can help the body mitigate these dangerous reflexes. This is called habituation. The physiological effects are profound and many of the health hazards are minimized (though not eliminated).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what about the physiological benefits?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out, many of the claims are based on &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9518606/"&gt;relatively small-scale studies&lt;/a&gt;, and the scientific evidence is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317615"&gt;observational studies&lt;/a&gt; note that regular swimmers report fewer infections, but this is plagued by a “healthy user bias”—it’s unclear if the swimming makes people healthy, or if only healthy people choose to do it. Cold exposure is a well-known activator of the Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT), a special “burning” tissue that generates heat by consuming glucose and lipids. Repeated exposure can turn “storage” fat into “burning” fat, but contrary to popular belief, this doesn’t always lead to fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most robustly supported long-term benefit is the one Ella describes: a profound effect on mood. The science provides a clear neurochemical basis for this. One study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10751106/"&gt;examining the hormonal response&lt;/a&gt; to one hour of cold water immersion (at 14°C or 57°F) found a massive 530% increase in plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This massive surge probably explains why people feel so good after cold swimming. Noradrenaline is a key neurotransmitter for arousal, vigilance, and focus, producing the feeling of being “wide awake” and cognitively sharp. &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/health/mind-brain/why-dopamine-makes-you-happy/"&gt;Dopamine&lt;/a&gt; is the primary neurotransmitter of the brain’s reward and motivation circuits, providing a powerful feeling of pleasure, satisfaction, and elevated mood that explains the practice’s “antidepressant effect”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="winter-swimming-tips"&gt; Winter Swimming Tips&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014.webp 960w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014.jpg 960w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Henri_kuprashvili_-_The_Winter_Swimming_2014-750x500.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" class="wp-image-294053 sp-no-webp" alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Winter Swimming World Championships in 2014.

&lt;p&gt;Then, there’s also the subjective experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Outdoor swimming often feels spontaneous, something you do on a sunny day,” says Ella. “Winter swimming is different. You need to plan ahead: get in, enjoy it, and get out safely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She emphasizes the importance of knowing your own body. “Go regularly and pay attention to how you feel. Take notes if it helps, learn what works for you. Don’t stay in too long, because of something called ‘afterdrop.’ That’s when your body keeps cooling even after you’re out. We call the first few minutes after a swim the ‘honeymoon period.’ You feel amazing and alive, but it’s actually the crucial time to get dry, put on warm clothes, and sip a hot drink before chatting with others.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cheung recommends never going alone. This is more than just a safety thing; it makes the entire activity more enjoyable. “Cold bathing in a social environment gives you connection, and it gets you out of the house on a chilly day. Those are some of the added benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also issues a strong warning about alcohol: “Don’t mix alcohol with cold swimming. It dulls your sensations, so you don’t respond as well if an emergency arises, the kind of signals your body gives in cold water. Alcohol also keeps your blood vessels and skin wide open, which makes you feel warm and flushed, but it actually causes you to lose heat faster.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it’s always recommended to have a quick way to dry and reheat. Hot drinks are always welcome after a cold swim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those prepared and respectful of the risks, a cold plunge can be more than a shock. It’s an invigorating reset—one that wakes up the body, sharpens the mind, and leaves many swimmers riding a natural high for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than a third of Americans who were vaccinated against COVID-19 say they had side effects from the shot, and nearly half suspect the vaccines killed many patients,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 68% of American Adults say they got a COVID-19 vaccination, and a majority (60%) of vaccinated adults report no side effects from the vaccine. However, 26% say they had minor side effects and 10% reported major side effects from the vaccine. Based on a U.S. adult population of 258 million, this would mean 63 million had at least some side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine, including more than 17 million who experienced major side effects.

&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among all American Adults (including those who didn’t get vaccinated against COVID-19), 46% believe it is likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths – down from 55% in &lt;a href="/public_content/lifestyle/covid_19/killer_shot_most_still_suspect_covid_19_vaccine_risk" target="_self"&gt;September 2024 &lt;/a&gt;– including 25% who say it’s Very Likely. Forty-four percent (44%) now don’t think a significant number of deaths have been caused by vaccine side effects, including 20% who believe it’s Not At All Likely. Another 12% are not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey of 1,292 American Adults was conducted on November 10-12, 2024 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC. See&lt;a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/about_us/methodology" target="_blank"&gt; methodology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who didn’t get the COVID-19 vaccine are more likely to suspect it had deadly side effects. Seventy percent (70%) of those who weren’t vaccinated, compared to 36% of those who did get the shot, consider it at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those who were vaccinated, 85% of those who reported major side effects think it’s at least somewhat likely that COVID-19 vaccines caused a significant number of deaths. By comparison, 69% of those who reported no side effects from the vaccine consider it unlikely that COVID-19 vaccines caused a significant number of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly more men (72%) than women (66%) got vaccinated against COVID-19 during the pandemic, and more men (12%) than women (8%) report experiencing major side effects from the shot. However, more women (49%) than men (43%) consider it at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older voters are most likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 during the pandemic, and less likely to say they experienced side effects. Twenty-two percent (22%) of men under 40 say they experienced major side effects from the vaccine, compared to just seven percent (7%) of women 40 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forty-two percent (42%) of whites, 46% of blacks, 53% of Hispanics and 63% of other minorities believe it is at least somewhat likely that side effects of COVID-19 vaccines have caused a significant number of unexplained deaths. Hispanics are most likely to have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine during the pandemic, and also most likely to report having experienced major side effects from the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty-seven percent (57%) of Americans with annual incomes between $30,000-$50,000 say it’s likelythat COVID-19 vaccines caused many deaths, compared to just 36% of those with annual incomes over $200,000 who say the same.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;About one in ten perimenopausal or menopausal women masturbate to relieve their symptoms, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/GME.0000000000002675"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that has generated &lt;a href="https://www.technologynetworks.com/diagnostics/news/women-rate-masturbation-highly-for-managing-menopause-symptoms-407027"&gt;media interest&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention is likely because masturbation is a novel (and possibly somewhat salacious) strategy to ease these symptoms, and older women are &lt;a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=_onDEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PA123&amp;amp;dq=older+women+treated+as+asexual&amp;amp;ots=8G12H9r5JV&amp;amp;sig=Ud_eYMUr6sdfTbe10Z0dsIZclb4"&gt;often seen as asexual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So does masturbating really relieve symptoms, as the study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Menopause&lt;/em&gt; suggests? Let's see if the evidence stacks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/menopause-isnt-as-responsible-for-lost-libido-as-we-always-thought"&gt;Menopause Isn't as Responsible For Lost Libido as We Always Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The health benefits of masturbation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in the United States and was led by researchers at the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, one of the world's best known research institutes that specializes in sex and relationships. The study was funded by sex toy company Womanizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4135/9781412963909.n363"&gt;representative sample&lt;/a&gt; of 1,178 perimenopausal and menopausal women aged 40–65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who reported changes in their periods but still had at least one period in the previous year were categorized as perimenopausal. Women who said they had not have a period in a year or longer were categorized as menopausal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About four in five of the women said they had ever masturbated. Of those, about 20 percent said masturbating relieved their symptoms to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For perimenopausal women, the most improved symptoms were sleep difficulties and irritability. For a small number of menopausal women, it helped most with vaginal pain, bloating and painful urination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are consistent with previous research showing masturbating to orgasm may help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19317611.2024.2344812"&gt;reduce anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and psychological distress, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00033"&gt;improve sleep&lt;/a&gt; and reduce &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681990601149197"&gt;vaginal pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, research on the health, social or relationship benefits of masturbation, including for menopause relief, is sparse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we cannot be sure exactly how masturbating might improve symptoms. But researchers propose the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sxmrev/qeaf023"&gt;relaxation effects&lt;/a&gt; of orgasm, and the release of endorphins, can improve mood, help sleep and reduce pain. Sexual stimulation may also induce vaginal lubrication and blood flow to the genital area, which can help maintain vaginal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small number of women in the study said masturbating worsened their symptoms, although it was unclear why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182606" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182606" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the anatomy of a clitoris ." class="wp-image-182606 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram.jpg 1284w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-642x618.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-701x675.jpg 701w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-768x739.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ClitoralAnatomyDiagram-600x578.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1284px) 100vw, 1284px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182606" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The internal anatomy of the clitoris, with the clitoral hood and labia minora indicated as lines.

But it still carries a level of stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-010-9722-0"&gt;Women&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, often associate masturbation with sexual shame and tend &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sexol.2017.09.009"&gt;not to talk&lt;/a&gt; openly about their masturbation habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00224499.2012.745474"&gt;stigma and invisibility&lt;/a&gt; of masturbation means it is rarely the subject of clinical research investigating its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, we have very little evidence on its effectiveness to relieve menopause symptoms, especially compared to other non-medical interventions such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12905-024-03243-4"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2515690X19829380"&gt;stress relief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US study showed women were substantially more likely to manage menopause symptoms through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13697137.2025.2548806"&gt;evidence-based strategies&lt;/a&gt; of physical activity, diet or stress reduction, than with masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many women in the study might have never considered masturbation to relieve their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Masturbation isn't for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masturbation is free, relatively easy and, for most women, &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-08-29/its-time-to-close-the-masturbation-gap/10182068"&gt;enjoyable&lt;/a&gt;. There is no reason why it should not be promoted as an accessible menopause relief strategy that may benefit some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not always so simple. There may be barriers for some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02071-z"&gt;Not all women&lt;/a&gt; masturbate or enjoy masturbation. The US study showed nearly one in five women surveyed had never masturbated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This number was higher among older, menopausal women, perhaps reflecting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1300/J056v14n02_04?urlappend=%3Futm_source%3Dresearchgate.net%26medium%3Darticle"&gt;generational change&lt;/a&gt; in attitudes about masturbation. Some women in the study indicated a moral or religious resistance to masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have similarly shown that a number of women &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-006-9123-6"&gt;do not masturbate&lt;/a&gt;. There may be many reasons for this, from lack of desire through to &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/06/happyplaytime-app-hopes-to-help-women-masturbate-but-overlooks-the-real-reason-that-we-dont-logistics.html"&gt;limited privacy&lt;/a&gt; or "alone time".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.09.037"&gt;Older women&lt;/a&gt; may experience complex physical barriers, including loss of libido or limited dexterity and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silence and stigma around masturbation may also make it difficult for health professionals to discuss masturbation with women. This was evident in the US study, with almost all reporting they had never spoken to a doctor about masturbation for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many women were open to these conversations, however, with about 56 percent of perimenopausal women indicating they would masturbate more often to treat menopause symptoms if their doctor recommended it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Masturbation as a novel strategy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there can be no guarantee masturbation will relieve menopause symptoms for all women, suggesting women give it a go is unlikely to cause harm. It is the &lt;a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/news/give-yourself-a-hand-the-health-benefits-of-masturbation"&gt;safest sex available&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't talk much about masturbation, especially among older women. But by demonstrating that most older women do masturbate and this may offer health benefits, this latest study is novel and valuable.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/270146/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

For people in the US, the UK and Australia, these foods make up &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/19/australia-ultra-processed-foods-consumption-rate-upf-lancet" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than half the calories they consume each day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But it’s not always easy to tell which foods are ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The term was coined &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19366466/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in 2009&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at the University of São Paulo, as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/ultraprocessed-foods-what-they-are-and-how-to-identify-them/E6D744D714B1FF09D5BCA3E74D53A185" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt; that sorts foods into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group one: unprocessed or minimally processed foods including whole fruits and vegetables, milk, oats and rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group two: processed basic ingredients used in cooking including salt, sugar and vegetable oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group three: processed foods made by adding items from groups one and two. Includes canned legumes, bread and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Group four: ultra-processed foods which are commercial products made from extracts of foods, often with added chemicals, flavours and other ingredients you wouldn’t find in a home kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While there can be health harms from an unbalanced diet of foods in any of the groups – for example, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/nov/24/the-truth-about-salt-how-to-avoid-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-hidden-killers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;those containing too much salt&lt;/a&gt; – researchers say the problem with group four is that the processes used to make them and the industrial ingredients they contain mean they are not “real food” and are more likely to cause health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But they can be hard to spot. A long ingredients list with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;names you don’t recognise (hello maltodextrin and soy lecithin) is a giveaway for ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re unsure, the &lt;a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Open Food Facts&lt;/a&gt; app lets you search for products and see their category.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you decide to take a combination creatine and magnesium supplement, consider taking it in the morning or with your workout.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people take a large loading dose of creatine to saturate their muscle stores before taking smaller daily doses.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You could try to get creatine and magnesium from food sources first, but if you want to take supplements, remember that higher doses are not always better.

"Both magnesium and creatine can take weeks to have beneficial effects because the body must reach certain levels, which takes time, to have an increased effect on health and physical activity," &lt;a href="https://mann.usc.edu/faculty/kari-l-franson-pharmd-phd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kari Franson, PharmD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, professor of clinical pharmacy and director of the sports pharmacy program at USC Mann, told Verywell in an email.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people may experience uncomfortable gastrointestinal side effects when taking creatine and magnesium, such as nausea and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-to-do-if-creatine-makes-you-bloated-11812779" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As the U.S. continues to face its &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worst&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measles outbreak in three decades, another country that has struggled with measles offers a telling case study: the eastern European nation of Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most countries hardest hit by measles are lower-income countries in the Global South, wealthier countries have also seen significant outbreaks. Romania is one of them. The country ranked &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fifth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the measles outbreak list last year, reporting 30,692 cases and &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/MEAS-AER-2024-Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;23 deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Aurora Stanescu, an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Public Health in Romania, five of those deaths were children under age 1.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Schwalbe calls those figures a "wake-up call."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's a lot of cases of measles, and that's a lot of deaths from a disease that really shouldn't be killing anybody at this point," Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unlike many lower-resource countries where measles &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;takes a toll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen — Romania is an upper-middle-income country and part of the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even now, the consequences of low vaccine rates linger. The country &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/06/03/measles-in-europe-where-are-cases-of-one-of-the-most-contagious-diseases-rising" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to report measles cases in 2025. However, initial tallies are significantly lower than those of last year. According to public health specialists in Romania, the current numbers reflect how measles &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/v17060755" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to come in waves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Amid a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/13/1231104444/the-anti-vaccine-movement" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;growing trend&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine hesitancy around the world, Romania's experience paints a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An authoritarian past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The outbreaks aren't only a matter of poverty and not understanding the importance of immunization," says Dr. Mihai Craiu, a pediatrician at Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Romania. "It's multifactorial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of the forces driving the measles surge is Romania's political transition. Under the repressive Communist government that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/12/24/369593135/25-years-after-death-a-dictator-still-casts-a-shadow-in-romania" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ruled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more than four decades, vaccines for childhood diseases were required.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Immunizations were &lt;a href="https://romania.europalibera.org/a/doctor-mihai-craiu-fake-news-medicina-vaccinare-stiinta-dezinformare/33569279.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;given&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to kids at school without parental consent, Craiu says. "Virtually all children were immunized," he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Prevention of infectious diseases by vaccination were ideal terrains in which the Communist state could demonstrate its power and legitimate its authority," historian Dora Vargha &lt;a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.7765/9781526110916.00010/html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a book about vaccines. "If vaccination worked, the result would be immediate and visible."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;introduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. The result: a 90% reduction in cases, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050221.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;according&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And an immunization rate above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the magic number for measles. "If 95% of people are vaccinated, the measles virus can't find a home for itself in those people, and eventually it gives up," Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came political — and vaccine — upheaval. When Romania &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/1999/11/05/1066228/the-collapse-of-communism" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adopted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a democratic form of government in 1989, citizens gained more freedom — including the ability to decline the recommended but no longer mandatory vaccine.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Like others in post-Communist countries, Romanians &lt;a href="https://www.culturaldiplomacy.org/academy/content/articles/symposium2010/participant-papers/Simona_Vasilache_-_Romania.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;grew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; more distrustful of their government — and the immunizations it was recommending. This laid the foundation for anti-vaccine groups to step in and take advantage of the public mindset.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Part of the perception of democracy in Romania was the liberty of not obeying the rules," Craiu says, noting that some Romanians view immunization as a form of Communist-era state control. When Romanians refuse vaccines, he says it's their way of asserting independence after decades of authoritarian leadership.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The impact of an HPV vaccine campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But vaccine refusal wasn't just about asserting personal freedom. People began doubting the benefits of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decline [in vaccination] is partly due to decreased public confidence in vaccination benefits, reflected in parental refusal to vaccinate their children," &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;read&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a report published in October by Romania's National Institute for Public Health — their equivalent of the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This trend was exacerbated by growing skepticism about vaccines, exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12013266" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2008 campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate girls against HPV, the virus that can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5323229/hpv-vaccine-cancer-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cause&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cervical cancer. That campaign deepened public skepticism about all vaccines, as &lt;a href="https://rtsa.ro/tras/index.php/tras/article/view/195/191" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;headlines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from various Romanian media outlets demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;At the time of the HPV vaccine rollout, measles vaccine coverage stood at the recommended 95% rate. In subsequent years, it declined steadily, &lt;a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/wuenic-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dropping&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 20 percentage points by 2017 and further declining to just 62% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study conducted by Stanescu and her colleagues last year &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-rezultatelor-estimarii-acoperirii-vaccinale-cu-2-doze-rro-la-5-ani-si-cu-1-doza-dtpa-la-14-ani_februarie-2024/?wpdmdl=127363&amp;amp;refresh=68f9bc5de5a3c1761197149" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that only one of Romania's more than 40 regions had measles vaccine coverage above 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pandemic exacerbated that sharp nosedive in vaccine coverage, the National Institute for Public Health report observes, noting disruptions in routine vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the share of those protected against measles decreased, &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=ROU&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pummeled the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some saw the outbreaks in the 2010s as a wake-up call, but others didn't," says Dr. Gindrovel Dumitra, the vice president of the Romanian National Society of Family Medicine. "Some people simply refuse vaccines — and even an outbreak won't convince them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A health system struggles to keep up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Along with Romania's growing anti-vaccine movement, the country faces systemic barriers that contribute to its low vaccination rates. Dumitra points to three main factors: a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/21/romanias-health-care-system-the-eus-worst-struggles-to-reform" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fragile health system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that remains one of the most &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Healthcare_expenditure_statistics_-_overview" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;underfunded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Europe, a &lt;a href="https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-025-00985-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shrinking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; number of primary care providers — driven by burnout and low compensation —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11598722/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;absence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of mandatory immunization policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lack of funding for health care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/27-08-2025-new-study-exposes-barriers-to-childhood-vaccination-in-romanian-communities" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disproportionately affects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; minority groups like the country's &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/combatting-discrimination/roma-eu/roma-equality-inclusion-and-participation-eu-country/romania_en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 2 million Roma people. Minorities are often blamed for low vaccination rates, but Craiu says a deeper look reveals that the problem stems from inadequate outreach and lack of access to care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you don't have a family doctor in your village, then first of all, it's difficult to get information and then it's also difficult to access vaccines," says Dr. Silvia Gatscher, the health operations manager at the World Health Organization Country Office in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the years passed, the clergy &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/vaccines-carry-tiny-knives-cut-veins-inside-romanias-toxic-anti/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;became&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-024-20133-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influential&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/romania-president-election-simion-trump.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advocating&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; against vaccines — some say as a reaction to the government &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21567689.2022.2080669" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;limiting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; church services during the early years of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, far-right politicians &lt;a href="https://cepa.org/article/romanias-elections-a-victory-for-medical-populism/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;capitalized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on growing mistrust toward vaccines. One of those anti-vaccine lawmakers is Diana Sosoaca. She said, "God is not vaccinated" during a &lt;a href="https://spotmedia.ro/en/news/politics/romanian-mep-sosoaca-anti-vaccine-circus-in-the-european-parliament-until-her-microphone-was-cut-off-god-is-not-vaccinated-in-romania-88-are-not-vaccinated" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brief speech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the floor of the European Parliament last year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A free fall in immunization coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Currently, only two-thirds of Romanians are fully vaccinated against measles. That's the &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/measles-vaccination-coverage?GROUP=Countries&amp;amp;ANTIGEN=MCV2&amp;amp;YEAR=&amp;amp;CODE=" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lowest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measles vaccination rate in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The shortfall has serious consequences. Researchers &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.1787" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that one person who contracts the virus can infect up to 18 unvaccinated people nearby. The risk is especially dire for children too young to have completed the two-dose vaccination protocol, which is &lt;a href="https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=170&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;administered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first at 12 months and then again at age 5.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That includes babies like Ionela Radulescu's son. Last year, the 7-month-old was hospitalized for pneumonia and came into contact with a child infected with measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He had a rash on his face. It was pinkish and very small," the 31-year-old mother says through an interpreter. "Then it started going down onto his chest and palms. It even went down to the soles of his feet. He had it everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Radulescu lives in Suceava, in northern Romania. Last year, the area &lt;a href="https://insp.gov.ro/download/analiza-bolilor-transmisibile-aflate-in-supraveghere-raport-pentru-anul-2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recorded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the sixth-highest rate of measles cases among more than 40 regions. The frequency of cases in Suceava &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaf167" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mirrored&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; levels seen in countries before the measles vaccine became widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although her son was too young to be vaccinated, the mother says: "I felt bad. It was very hard. I started questioning myself and asking questions like, Was I too negligent? Was I not careful enough? You start to blame yourself. It's a really ugly feeling."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles can be far more than an uncomfortable rash. The virus can &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lead to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pneumonia, eye inflammation, diarrhea and ear infections, which can result in deafness in approximately 5 to 10% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even after recovering from the illness, children remain at risk for a rare and fatal complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It typically &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560673/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;appears&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about seven to 10 years after the initial infection. Stanescu estimates there have been about a dozen cases in Romania in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Just because you're OK from that infection at the time doesn't mean that that infection doesn't have very serious consequences for you later in life," Schwalbe explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A different way to talk to parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While Craiu and Dumitra admit it's an uphill battle, they've taken an evidence-based approach to combating misinformation and encouraging vaccination. "It's a huge difference in what we learned in medical school and what I'm doing now," Craiu explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When speaking with parents, Dumitra &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/ppa.s500640" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;uses motivational interviewing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a technique that helps patients adopt changes when they decide the change matters to them — not because a doctor said so. It also encourages physicians to listen without judgment, exploring a patient's ambivalence. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2023-065483" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics praises the method&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an effective way to improve communication about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Yesterday, when I recommended a woman to be vaccinated against the flu, she told me, 'I'm scared of the vaccine.' I asked her, 'Why?'" Dumitra recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The woman explained she was worried the vaccine would worsen a chronic illness. "After acknowledging her concerns, I offered her information and then verified if she understood it. She eventually got vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons from Romania's outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gatscher is optimistic that evidence-based approaches to vaccine hesitancy will chip away at the mistrust and misinformation surrounding vaccines in her country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet the global measles count this year indicates that other relatively well-off countries aren't drawing any lessons from Romania. This month, Canada &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2025/11/statement-from-the-public-health-agency-of-canada-on-canadas-measles-elimination-status.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lost&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its measles elimination status due to sustained transmission, &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 5,000 cases so far this year. The U.S. has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1,723 cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 so far, according to the CDC — the highest annual number &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5461155/measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccination-health" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in more than three decades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. has much to learn from what has happened in Romania, Schwalbe says America exists in its "own bubble" and often looks away from examples like Romania.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I think we are incredibly good in America at thinking, 'That's what's happening over there, and it has nothing to do with us,'" Schwalbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think that Romania will teach us any lessons, unfortunately, even though it's such a clear lesson. The lesson to everybody — all over the world — is that when you lose high coverage of [vaccination against] measles, the disease comes back."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michal Ruprecht is a Stanford Global Health Media Fellow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                The CDC has made a dramatic about-face in the agency's position on the relationship between vaccines and autism.

   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧&lt;strong&gt; CDC scientists say they didn't change their website&lt;/strong&gt;, and the Department of Health and Human Services wouldn't divulge who ordered the adjustment to the wording, NPR's Pien Huang tells &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;. There is &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;no new scientific evidence to support the claim&lt;/a&gt; of a link between vaccines and autism. Huang notes that it is interesting that a headline on the CDC's webpage still states that vaccines don't cause autism. However, there is an asterisk next to this statement, which explains that the agency will not remove it due to an agreement with Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, who provided a key confirmation vote for Kennedy to become the HHS secretary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump's chief negotiator has presented a new 28-point plan for peace to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.&lt;/strong&gt; International observers are encouraged that Trump has not given up on peace between Ukraine and Russia, but the proposal requires major territorial concessions from Ukraine, which the country has repeatedly rejected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The Trump administration continues to suggest these concessions because the president is focused on getting a yes to his plan&lt;/strong&gt;, says NPR's Franco Ordoñez. Russian analyst Sam Charap notes that for Trump, the details don't matter as much. He simply wants the fighting to come to an end, unlike the leaders of Russia and Ukraine, who are &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;more focused on the details&lt;/a&gt;. Russia desires more strategic territory, while Ukraine has been adamant on security guarantees from Washington and its Western allies to ensure this type of invasion doesn't happen again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump will meet with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House's Oval Office today. &lt;/strong&gt;This will mark the first time the two will meet face-to-face. Mamdani, a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, emerged as a national figure after his primary win earlier this year. The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5615169/trump-mamdani-oval-office-communist-socialist" target="_blank"&gt;president has called Mamdani a "communist"&lt;/a&gt; on social media and repeatedly sought to paint him as too radical for the city that elected him mayor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;The meeting is a reminder of the shift Mamdani has to make as he steps into the new role&lt;/strong&gt;, says NPR's Elena Moore. The mayor-elect has a background as an activist, but today will be a &lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=nx-s1-5616178:x" target="_blank"&gt;test for him in balancing his policy priorities&lt;/a&gt; and maintaining political diplomacy. As a reminder, Moore says, the president vowed to cut New York's federal funding if Mamdani won the election, so the meeting comes with real stakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State and local voting officials from both major political parties are actively preparing for the possibility of the Trump administration's interference&lt;/strong&gt; in the midterm elections, which are less than a year away. The president has consistently spread false claims about voting in the U.S. In the spring, he issued an executive order aimed at imposing significant changes to election systems. Although courts have largely blocked the order, he has hinted at the possibility of taking other executive action as well. The election community is concerned that Trump plans to have a heavy hand in their processes next year. Here are a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/21/nx-s1-5599934/2026-trump-midterm-election-ballots-voting-national-guard" target="_blank"&gt;few things voting officials are watching for&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deep dive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-97821" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The planet has warmed about 1.3 degrees Celsius, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Communities are already experiencing more severe storms, flooding, and heatwaves. Scientists warn that when the planet heats up beyond 1.5 degrees, there could be massive, self-reinforcing changes that could have devastating impacts worldwide. These changes are sometimes referred to as climate tipping points. They can unfold over decades or centuries and may be partially reversible. But they all have enormous and lasting implications for life on Earth. Here are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/11/19/nx-s1-5593087/climate-tipping-points-cop30-brazil-coral-glaciers-carbon" target="_blank"&gt;most important and well-studied changes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Coral reefs have been dying around the globe. They are very sensitive to heat, and their loss would destabilize many countries. Numerous people rely on them for food, income and livelihoods. Marine life that can only be found on these reefs would be at risk of extinction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica could melt and result in the rise of sea levels around the world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;💧 Permanently frozen ground in the Arctic is thawing, which can cause the land to sink, resulting in cracks in the foundations of buildings, buckling of roads and the kinking of pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay up-to-date with the latest news&lt;/strong&gt; from the COP30, the United Nations climate meeting in Brazil, with this &lt;a href="https://app.npr.org/curatedplaylist/changingplanet" target="_blank"&gt;app-exclusive playlist of stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Despite having &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/decades-neglecting-an-ancient-disease-has-triggered-a-health-emergency-around-the-world-121282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;plagued humans for millennia&lt;/a&gt;, typhoid  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="182049" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt; is rarely considered a threat in developed countries today. But this ancient killer is still very much &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42353-9"&gt;a danger in our modern world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext"&gt;Research published in 2022&lt;/a&gt; revealed the bacterium that causes typhoid fever is evolving extensive drug resistance, and is rapidly replacing strains that aren't resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, antibiotics are the only way to effectively treat typhoid, which is caused by the bacterium &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; serovar Typhi (S Typhi). Yet over the past three decades, the bacterium's resistance to oral antibiotics has been growing and spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-new-antibiotic-was-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-decades"&gt;Powerful New Antibiotic Was 'Hiding in Plain Sight' For Decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, scientists from multiple countries sequenced the genomes of 3,489 S Typhi strains contracted from 2014 to 2019 in Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India, and found a rise in extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Typhi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XDR Typhi is not only impervious to frontline antibiotics, like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but it is also &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;growing resistant&lt;/a&gt; to newer antibiotics, like fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse, these strains are spreading globally at a rapid rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most XDR Typhi cases stem from south Asia, researchers have identified nearly 200 instances of international spread since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most strains have been exported to Southeast Asia, as well as East and Southern Africa, but typhoid superbugs have also been found in the UK, the US, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The speed at which highly resistant strains of S Typhi have emerged and spread in recent years is a real cause for concern, and highlights the need to urgently expand prevention measures, particularly in countries at greatest risk," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/the-bacteria-that-cause-typhoid-fever-are-getting-better-at-evading-antibiotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Stanford University infectious disease researcher Jason Andrews when the results were published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have been warning about drug-resistant typhoid for years now. In 2016, the first XDR typhoid strain was &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/27-december-2018-typhoid-pakistan-en"&gt;identified in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;. By 2019, it had become the dominant genotype in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, most XDR typhoid strains have been fought with third-generation antimicrobials, like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinolone_antibiotic"&gt;quinolones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin"&gt;cephalosporins&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolide"&gt;macrolides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the early 2000s, mutations that confer resistance to quinolones accounted for more than 85 percent of all cases in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Singapore. At the same time, cephalosporin resistance was also taking over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.coalitionagainsttyphoid.org/the-issues/drug-resistant-typhoid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;only one oral antibiotic is left&lt;/a&gt;: the macrolide, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azithromycin"&gt;azithromycin&lt;/a&gt;. And this medicine might not work for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext#seccestitle10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; mutations that confer resistance to azithromycin are now also spreading, "threatening the efficacy of all oral antimicrobials for typhoid treatment". While these mutations have not yet been adopted by XDR S Typhi, if they are, we are in serious trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If untreated, up to 20 percent of typhoid cases can be fatal, and &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/typhoid-reported-cases-and-incidence?CODE=Global&amp;amp;YEAR="&gt;in 2024, there were over 13 million cases of typhoid reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future outbreaks can be prevented to some extent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(24)00055-X/fulltext"&gt;with typhoid conjugate vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, but if access to these shots is not expanded globally, the world could soon have another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-top-infectious-killer-claimed-1-23-million-lives-last-year-who-says"&gt;health crisis&lt;/a&gt; on its hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182576" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/map_4.20.1-642x361.jpg" alt="A world map highlighting regions where the typhoid vaccine is recommended.

            The top authorities of U.S. cancer statistics will soon have to classify the sex of patients strictly as male, female, or unknown, a change scientists and advocates say will harm the health of transgender people, one of the nation’s most marginalized populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300063b6qbumk9n7q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists and advocates for trans rights say the change will make it much harder to understand cancer diagnoses and trends among the trans population. Certain studies have shown that transgender people are more likely to use tobacco products or less likely to receive routine cancer screenings — factors that could put them at higher risk of disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300073b6q4r090ism@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The change is a consequence of Trump administration policies recognizing only “male” and “female” sexes, according to cancer researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300083b6qydul6auy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists said the change will affect all cancer registries, in every state and territory, because they receive federal funding. Starting in 2026, registries funded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute &lt;a href="https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=26/data-item-view/item-number=225/" target="_blank"&gt;will categorize cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; as male, female, or not stated/unknown. And federal health agencies will receive data only on cancer patients classified that way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300093b6q21z4bafd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Registries &lt;a href="https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=25/data-item-view/item-number=220/" target="_blank"&gt;currently specify&lt;/a&gt; whether a cancer patient’s sex is “male,” “female,” “other,” various options for “transsexual,” or that the patient’s sex is not stated or unknown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000a3b6q17se4l2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            President Donald Trump in January issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; stating that the government would recognize only male and female sexes. Cancer registry officials said the federal government directed them to revise how they collect data on cancer patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000b3b6qobgcy9bm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the U.S., if you’re receiving federal money, then we, essentially, we weren’t given any choice,” Eric Durbin, director of the Kentucky Cancer Registry and president of the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, told KFF Health News. NAACCR, which receives federal funds, maintains cancer reporting standards across the U.S. and Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000c3b6qeiv5yga2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials will need to classify patients’ sex as unknown when a “patient’s sex is documented as other than male or female (e.g., non-binary, transsexual), and there is no additional information about sex assigned at birth,” the new standard says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000e3b6q5utc54kc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers said they do not have high-quality population-level data on cancer incidence in transgender people but had been making inroads at improving it — work now at risk of being undone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000f3b6qh6c3o3qm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When it comes to cancer and inequities around cancer, you can use the cancer registries to see where the dirtiest air pollution is, because lung cancer rates are higher in those areas. You can see the impact of nuclear waste storage because of the types of cancers that are higher in those ZIP codes, in those areas of the country,” said Shannon Kozlovich, who is on the executive committee of the California Dialogue on Cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000g3b6qqian2kbh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The more parts of our population that we are excluding from this dataset means that we are not going to know what’s happening,” she said. “And that doesn’t mean that it’s not happening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000h3b6qpa462c0w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For decades, cancer registries have been the most comprehensive U.S. surveillance tool for understanding cancer incidence and survival rates and identifying troubling disease trends. Each year, cancer cases are reported by hospitals, pathology labs, and other health facilities into regional and statewide cancer registries. The compiled data documents cancer and mortality rates among regions, races, sexes, and age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000i3b6qndymsihv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two federal programs serve as the top authorities on cancer statistics, with information on tens of millions of cases. The CDC’s National Program of Cancer Registries provides funding to organizations in 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S. Pacific Island territories. Its data represents &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/national-program-cancer-registries/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;97% of the U.S. population&lt;/a&gt;. The National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, known as SEER, collects and publishes data from registries covering &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/about/overview.html" target="_blank"&gt;nearly half&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000j3b6q8x3f30pp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The information published by cancer registries has led to changes in treatment and  prevention, and the enactment of other policies designed to reduce diagnosis rates and mortality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000k3b6q5qoca1f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, data collected by cancer registries was essential in identifying &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28376186/" target="_blank"&gt;rising rates of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; among people &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5123715/" target="_blank"&gt;younger than 50&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, U.S. guidelines &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/detection/colorectal_cancer" target="_blank"&gt;now recommend&lt;/a&gt; that adults start screenings at age 45 rather than 50.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000l3b6q3eyb56hc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            States have enacted their own measures. Lara Anton, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said epidemiologists with the Texas Cancer Registry in 2018 found that the state had the nation’s highest incidence rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, a liver cancer more common in men than women. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559177/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas &lt;a href="https://cprit.texas.gov/news-events/articles/cprit-launches-new-liver-cancer-initiative-to-address-growing-texas-public-health-concern/" target="_blank"&gt;initiated a statewide effort&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reversing rising rates of liver cancer. The Texas Cancer Registry joined SEER in 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000m3b6qdmzdajiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Once a cancer patient is entered into a cancer registry, we follow those patients for the rest of their lives. Because we really need to know, do patients survive for different types of cancer and different stages of cancer?” Durbin said. “That’s incredibly important for public policies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000n3b6qv1j6fbzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The North American Association of Central Cancer Registries maintains national standards outlining what kind of data registries collect for each diagnosis. It develops the list in partnership with the CDC, the National Cancer Institute, and other organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000o3b6qgp5pclwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For any given patient, under NAACCR’s standards, Durbin said, registries collect more than 700 pieces of information, including demographics, diagnosis, treatment, and length of survival. CDC and NCI-funded registries must specify the sex of each patient.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000p3b6qg7v1cjob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NAACCR definitions and accompanying data standards are designed to ensure that registries collect case data uniformly. “Everyone essentially follows the standards” that NAACCR develops, Durbin said. Although registries can collect state-specific information, researchers said they need to follow those standards when sending cancer data to the federal government.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000q3b6qwx1hberc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an emailed statement, Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, “HHS is using biological science to guide policy, not ideological agendas that the Biden administration perpetrated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000s3b6qs3byy5dn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NAACCR routinely publishes updated guidelines. But the change to the “sex” category to remove transgender options in 2026 was an emergency move due to Trump administration policies, Kozlovich said. She was among a group that had pushed for changes in cancer data collection to account for sex and gender identity as separate data points.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000t3b6qqdbrtu5k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to an &lt;a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/" target="_blank"&gt;analysis of CDC data&lt;/a&gt; by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 2.8 million people age 13 and older identify as transgender.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000u3b6q8uj1q6ue@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists and trans rights advocates said in interviews that there are troubling signs that may make transgender people more likely to develop cancer or experience worse health outcomes than others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000v3b6qe7osu334@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Without evidence of our health disparities, you take away any impetus to fix them,” said Scout, executive director of the LGBTQIA+ Cancer Network.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000w3b6q9dgunwe6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A study published in 2022 found that transgender and gender-diverse populations were &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038608/" target="_blank"&gt;two to three times&lt;/a&gt; as likely as cisgender people to report active use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars. Tobacco use is a leading cause of cancer and death from cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000x3b6qx36zw7jo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30674526/" target="_blank"&gt;Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; concluded in 2019 that transgender patients were less likely to receive recommended screenings for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. And a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2800989" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at Stanford Medicine found that LGBTQ+ patients were nearly three times as likely to experience breast cancer recurrence as cisgender heterosexual people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000y3b6qfw1a8iuz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scarlett Lin Gomez, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco and the director of the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, said that for at least 10 years the NCI had been interested in improving its ability to monitor cancer burden across patient populations with different sexual orientations and gender identities. Cancer registries are a logical place to start because that is what they’re set up to do, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a3000z3b6qaxwpnekt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s been “slow but good progress,” Gomez said. “But now we’ve completely, personally, I think, regressed backwards.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300103b6q4xco0rl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The decision not to capture transgender identity in cancer patients is just one change registries have confronted under the Trump administration, according to scientists leading surveillance efforts and state health agencies. An HHS mandate to reduce spending on contracts led to funding cuts for cancer registries in NCI’s SEER program. Scientists said CDC funds for registries haven’t been cut; however, the White House’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget aims to eliminate funding for the National Program of Cancer Registries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300113b6qgw6o8ij7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the Trump administration’s other actions targeting trans people are canceling research grants for studies on LGBTQ+ health, dismantling the National Institutes of Health’s office for sexual and gender minority health, and &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/988-suicide-crisis-lifeline-hotline-lgbtq-press-3-option-ended-states-backfill/" target="_blank"&gt;stopping specialized services&lt;/a&gt; for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 national suicide prevention hotline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300123b6qlk04434t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without data, researchers can’t make a case to fund research that may help trans patients, Gomez said. “It’s erasure.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi7wc7a300133b6qisoqyca1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late-night brightness has become a defining feature of urban life. From &lt;strong&gt;blinking storefronts&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;LED-lit streetscapes&lt;/strong&gt;, artificial light surrounds us after dark — a modern comfort we rarely question. But a decade-long study out of Boston is casting this glow in a new light, suggesting it may be quietly undermining heart health while we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;New research presented at the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exposure-to-more-artificial-light-at-night-may-raise-heart-disease-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2025&lt;/a&gt; links nighttime exposure to &lt;strong&gt;artificial light&lt;/strong&gt; with heightened stress activity in the brain, inflamed arteries, and significantly increased cardiovascular risk. This emerging connection between environmental light and heart disease isn’t just theoretical — it’s been measured, tracked, and mapped at an individual level.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit:  American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Scientists followed hundreds of adults for over ten years, combining &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/satellite-images-worlds-most-colorful-lake/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81517" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;satellite data &lt;/a&gt;on light exposure with advanced &lt;strong&gt;PET/CT scans&lt;/strong&gt; to assess brain and artery function. They found a clear pattern: the brighter the nighttime light around a person’s home, the more their brain activated stress pathways known to fuel cardiovascular damage. For people living in high-noise or economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, the risks were even higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t about sleeping under floodlights. Even &lt;strong&gt;low levels of ambient light&lt;/strong&gt; — like the soft glow from a streetlamp or neon sign — were enough to trigger biological responses typically associated with long-term heart disease risk. And most of us are exposed every night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chronic Exposure, Real Cardiovascular Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Dr. Shady Abohashem of &lt;em&gt;Massachusetts General Hospital&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed 466 adults with no prior heart disease or cancer. Using PET/CT imaging, the team measured two key indicators of cardiovascular risk: &lt;strong&gt;stress-related brain activity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;arterial inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To estimate nighttime light exposure, the team relied on data from the Suomi NPP satellite, which uses the &lt;strong&gt;Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)&lt;/strong&gt; to detect ground-level artificial light, excluding natural sources like the moon or stars.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their results were stark. Each standard deviation increase in nighttime light was associated with:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35% higher risk&lt;/strong&gt; of major heart events over five years&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22% higher risk&lt;/strong&gt; over a ten-year period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the end of the follow-up, &lt;strong&gt;17% of participants&lt;/strong&gt; had experienced a serious cardiovascular event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found a nearly linear relationship between nighttime light and heart disease,” Abohashem said during the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exposure-to-more-artificial-light-at-night-may-raise-heart-disease-risk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;official AHA press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Even modest increases in night-time light were linked with higher brain and artery stress.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These stress signals are more than theoretical. When activated repeatedly, they can spark immune responses that cause &lt;strong&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;, harden arteries, and set the stage for &lt;strong&gt;heart attacks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;strokes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Light Pollution Joins a Growing List of Urban Health Threats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings come as attention turns to how &lt;strong&gt;environmental factors&lt;/strong&gt; — beyond diet and exercise — shape long-term heart health. While air pollution and noise have long been recognized, light has remained under the radar. That may be changing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HCQ.0000000000000139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2025 scientific statement&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt; outlines a framework for &lt;strong&gt;multidimensional sleep health&lt;/strong&gt;, emphasizing not only how long we sleep, but when, how consistently — and under what conditions. Artificial light, even at &lt;strong&gt;low intensity&lt;/strong&gt;, disrupts the&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/to-sleep-better-science-recommends-doing-this-1-2-hours-before-bed-and-its-surprisingly-simple/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="87863" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; body’s circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, delays melatonin release, and impairs sleep quality — all of which have established links to cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AHA statement identifies light pollution as a factor that “can suppress melatonin, delay sleep onset and even at low levels has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Boston study’s strength lies in its &lt;strong&gt;methodological design&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike many sleep studies that rely on self-reporting, this one used hard imaging data and satellite readings — a fusion of cardiology, neurology, and geospatial science rarely seen in this field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the research has limitations. It was observational and included a largely homogenous population drawn from a single healthcare system, so findings may not generalize broadly. The study has not yet been &lt;strong&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/strong&gt;, though it has been vetted and presented at a major cardiology conference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Compounding Effect of Social Stressors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all neighborhoods face the same&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/discovery-of-a-mysterious-substance-beneath-greenlands-glaciers-predictions-of-rising-sea-levels-questioned/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71366" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; level of risk&lt;/a&gt;. Participants living in areas with &lt;strong&gt;more traffic noise&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;lower household incomes&lt;/strong&gt; experienced a stronger link between artificial light and cardiovascular stress markers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This layered exposure mirrors broader health disparities. Residents in denser, under-resourced urban areas are often subject to more ambient noise, weaker insulation, and &lt;strong&gt;limited control&lt;/strong&gt; over light pollution from nearby buildings or infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers underscore that light exposure is “modifiable” — unlike many genetic or structural health risks. But addressing it will require more than better curtains. It will take &lt;strong&gt;policy-level interventions&lt;/strong&gt; in urban design, energy regulation, and housing standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;City governments could implement &lt;strong&gt;shielded street lighting&lt;/strong&gt;, enforce curfews on commercial signage, or adopt &lt;strong&gt;motion-sensitive&lt;/strong&gt; lighting systems that reduce unnecessary illumination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Adults in their 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s show up in emergency rooms every day with sudden weakness, trouble speaking, or vision loss. In many stroke cases, a blood clot blocks an artery that feeds the brain. Without fresh, oxygen‑rich blood, brain cells die fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors call these events early‑onset ischemic strokes when they happen between ages 18 and 59. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re less common than strokes in older adults, but they hit people who may be in school, working, or raising families. Many want to know why it happened and whether genes play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists led by University of Maryland School of Medicine (&lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMSOM&lt;/a&gt;) did a meta-analysis, searching the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-human-genome-map-could-transform-medicine/"&gt;human genome&lt;/a&gt; for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of people with early strokes is rising,” said study co-principal investigator Steven J. Kittner, MD, MPH, Professor of Neurology at UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These people are more likely to die from the life-threatening event, and survivors potentially face decades with disability. Despite this, there is little research on the causes of early strokes,” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kittner and his team combined 48 studies and compared about 16,730 adults who had an early‑onset &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/work-stress-linked-to-higher-stroke-risk-in-young-women/"&gt;ischemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; with nearly 600,000 adults who had not had a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used a genome‑wide association study (&lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genome-Wide-Association-Studies-GWAS"&gt;GWAS&lt;/a&gt;), which scans millions of common DNA differences and asks whether any show up more often in people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each small DNA change offers a tiny clue. Most of these common variants don’t act alone. Many nudge risk up or down by a little bit. Add those nudges across very large groups, and patterns start to stand out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-genome-scan-found"&gt;What the genome scan found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One region stood out: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_(gene)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ABO gene&lt;/a&gt;, which helps determine blood type A, B, AB, or O. The strongest signals in the scan clustered in this region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two specific genetic markers there pushed risk in opposite directions, a pattern that fits known biology of clot formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That opposite push matters. It signals that some versions of the ABO region raise the chance a clot will form and travel toward the brain, while others lower it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-type-and-stroke"&gt;Blood type and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ABO gene does more than set letters on red blood cells. It also helps set levels of clotting‑related proteins, especially &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;von Willebrand factor&lt;/a&gt; and factor VIII. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with non‑O blood types tend to have higher levels of these proteins, and the A1 subgroup usually sits near the high end of that range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII can make clots more likely. That connection explains why ABO biology shows up in a study of early stroke, which often begins with a clot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shared-genetic-signals"&gt;Shared genetic signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tested whether the same DNA signals in ABO influence several traits at once. They compared the markers tied to early‑onset stroke with markers tied to von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, and venous thromboembolism (&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/venous-thromboembolism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VTE&lt;/a&gt;), a condition where clots form in veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found strong evidence that the same underlying genetic signals in the ABO region affect all these traits, and statistical tests supported shared causes rather than random overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VTE often appears as a deep‑vein clot in a leg or as a clot that breaks off and travels to the lungs. Doctors already link higher von Willebrand factor and factor VIII levels to a greater chance of venous clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic overlap connects these clinical observations to specific differences in ABO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our meta-analysis looked at people’s genetic profiles and found associations between blood type and risk of early-onset stroke,” explained study co-principal investigator Braxton D. Mitchell, PhD, MPH, Professor of Medicine at UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The association of blood type with later-onset stroke was much weaker than what we found with early stroke.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-blood-type-and-stroke"&gt;Real-world blood type and stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic markers tell one part of the story; actual blood types tell another. People with early‑onset ischemic stroke were more likely to have &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-this-blood-group-age-more-slowly-according-to-new-research/"&gt;blood group&lt;/a&gt; A and less likely to have blood group O than comparison groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The B subgroup did not show a strong association with early stroke in this study, unlike patterns sometimes seen with venous clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These real‑world blood group patterns line up with the DNA signals near ABO. They point to blood‑type biology as a key piece of early stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still don’t know why blood type A would confer a higher risk, but it likely has something to do with blood-clotting factors like platelets and cells that line the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tiny-blood-vessels-may-fuel-the-spread-of-cancer-cells/"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; as well as other circulating proteins, all of which play a role in the development of blood clots,” said Dr. Kittner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fine-grained-clues-inside-abo"&gt;Fine‑grained clues inside ABO&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One genetic marker tagged the O1 blood subgroup and was linked to about a 12 percent reduction in the odds of early stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another marker tagged the A1 subgroup and was tied to about a 16 percent increase. The story is not as simple as “any non‑O type is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These opposite directions help explain why some people with certain ABO subgroups face higher risk while others see some protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-what-comes-next"&gt;Limits and what comes next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with its large numbers, the project has limits. It is one of the biggest genetic studies of early‑onset ischemic stroke so far, but it was still smaller than some studies in other diseases, so very small genetic effects may have gone undetected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most participants had European ancestry, even though the study included people from other backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because genetic variants can differ in frequency and effect across populations, larger and more diverse studies will sharpen the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-type-stroke-and-future-health"&gt;Blood type, stroke, and future health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroke risk does not arise from DNA alone. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/trying-to-lower-your-blood-pressure-this-common-nutrient-can-help/"&gt;Blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, diabetes, unhealthy cholesterol levels, infections, hormones such as those in some oral contraceptives, and everyday habits involving sleep, diet, and exercise all play roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point toward clotting‑related genetics having a stronger influence on strokes that happen earlier in adult life than on strokes that occur at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work can test prevention strategies that mix lifestyle information, medical history, and genetics for people who might benefit most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This important and surprising research finding adds to our current knowledge about non-modifiable risk factors for stroke – including a person’s blood type,” said Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Vice President for Medical Affairs at &lt;a href="https://www.umaryland.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study also highlights the need for future research to sort out the connection of blood group with clotting risk in more diverse populations. This will help us to better understand the strength of this association across different races and ethnicities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000201006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Nov 2025 11:56:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOZDFEV2FRNjhuSUtzUGN4dG85dFljdC1iTVQzOHNONHZocTlESWFnclF0MklEOXVKZnd4UmJXdjlMYl9yMm4xZXN2LUZTOGRKc2czaElIcjlHamwweURWWWdPcVRTUTRlMUNrbWRyTXJycTNHVDVFYzR1eVhaM3R6RHY0UFZtd08tcmtSb0JIWHZzeVpUdWpYR1ZYb05QRjcxcmc</guid></item><item><title>新药在临床试验中将“坏”胆固醇降低58% - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-lowers-bad-cholesterol-by-58-in-clinical-trial</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A powerful new treatment has emerged in efforts to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-cholesterol-diets-speed-up-cancer-tumour-growth-100-times"&gt;high cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and the associated risk of heart health problems. In a new trial, the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlicitide_decanoate"&gt;enlicitide decanoate&lt;/a&gt; was found to lower 'bad' cholesterol by almost 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international research team tested the drug in a randomized  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="182560" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; involving people with an inherited condition that causes dangerously high blood levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) – the 'bad' type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heterozygous &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22067-familial-hypercholesterolemia"&gt;familial hypercholesterolemia&lt;/a&gt; (HeFH) is a common genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 250 individuals and is characterized by elevated levels of LDL-C from birth," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;Drugs That Lower Cholesterol May Also Reduce Dementia Risk, Says Huge New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recruited 293 participants with HeFH, who were already taking cholesterol-lowering &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; that weren't having the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A once-daily enlicitide decanoate pill was shown to reduce LDL-C by an average of 58.2 percent after 24 weeks.

The main negative consequence is the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, restricting blood flow and limiting how much blood reaches the heart and brain.

However, at least for this subgroup of people, we may now have a way of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drugs-that-lower-cholesterol-may-also-reduce-dementia-risk-says-huge-new-study"&gt;lowering LDL-C&lt;/a&gt; back to regular levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;Eating Eggs Can Actually Lower Bad Cholesterol, New Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug still needs to get regulatory approval before it can be prescribed, but a phase 3 trial like this one is a key step – and the results are very encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without timely intervention to reduce plasma LDL-C levels," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt;, "individuals with HeFH face an increased risk of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to cumulative lifetime exposure to elevated LDL-C levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.20620"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scientists in Norway and Australia have developed a “nano-boosted” vinegar solution that enhances acetic acid’s antibacterial properties using cobalt-doped carbon quantum dots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In mouse studies, a single topical dose of the solution eliminated 99.995% of MRSA bacteria within 24 hours and completely cleared infections within a week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The research could lead to new non-toxic treatments for wound infections and is a promising step in fighting antimicrobial resistance, which causes millions of deaths annually.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vinegar is undoubtedly one of the most versatile tools in both the kitchen and the rest of your home. Not only can you use it in dressings, marinades, and more, but it's also an excellent cleaning agent, helping to keep everything from your countertops to showerheads sparkling. And now, thanks to a few very smart scientists, it might be used to help heal wounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In September, researchers from the University of Bergen in Norway, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, and Flinders University in Australia published their &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03108" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; on ways to "enhance vinegar's natural antibacterial power," the team shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251006051122.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The team explained that it was able to supercharge vinegar’s antibacterial properties by combining acetic acid — the active component in vinegar, which gives it that signature sour smell and taste — with cobalt-based carbon nanoparticles to produce "cobalt-doped carbon quantum dots."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What does that actually mean for people? According to the researchers, this "nano-boosted solution" can kill harmful bacteria such as MRSA, E. coli, and Enterococcus faecalis — a bacterium found in wounds that are difficult to heal — while appearing to remain safe for human use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To reach this conclusion, the team tested the nano-boosted solution on mouse models. They found that in mice with MRSA-infected skin wounds, a single topical dose of the solution reduced bacterial levels by 99.995% within 24 hours. After a week, the wounds showed no detectable MRSA infection. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Once exposed, the nanoparticles appear to attack dangerous bacteria from both inside the bacterial cell and also on its surface, causing them to burst," molecular biologists Dr. Adam Truskewycz, and an author of the study, explained in the release. "Importantly, this approach is non-toxic to human cells and was shown to remove bacterial infections from mice wounds without affecting healing." 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is more than just a novel way to treat bacterial infections. The researchers noted in their study that this new solution could help save lives, as "the global fight against antimicrobial resistance… is linked to an estimated 4.5 million infection-related deaths each year."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption id="mntl-figure-caption_1-0" class="comp mntl-figure-caption text-utility-100 figure-article-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="figure-article-caption-text"&gt;In a surprising breakthrough, researchers found that mixing acetic acid—the active ingredient in vinegar—with tiny cobalt-doped carbon dots kills dangerous bacteria. The nano-enhanced vinegar destroyed 99.995% of MRSA in lab tests.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They emphasized that there are too few drugs in development to fight antimicrobial resistance, and that most new drugs in this vein are variations on existing antibiotics. In short, they say we need more innovative solutions to fight bacterial infections.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors, however, added an important caveat in the limitations section of the study, noting that wound healing in mice differs "fundamentally from that in humans." Although the scientists minimized those differences as much as possible throughout their research, future analyses with animals such as pigs could and should be conducted, as they can more closely replicate human skin healing. Regardless, this work is a great start.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Combination treatments such as the ones highlighted in this study may help to curb antimicrobial resistance," Professor Nils Halberg, an author on the study, detailed. "Given this issue can kill up to five million people each year, it's vital we look to find new ways of killing pathogens like viruses, bacteria, and fungi, or parasites."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Next-generation vaccines could make the flu season less of a snot-filled nightmare—if they ever reach the public, that is. Trial data out this week shows that Pfizer’s mRNA-based flu vaccine performed markedly better than a traditional shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416779"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of a Phase III trial on the vaccine, funded by Pfizer, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The experimental vaccine was significantly more effective at preventing flu than a standard vaccine, the researchers found. The vaccine appears to cause slightly more side effects than others, but there’s a bigger concern: It’s uncertain whether it will be approved in the U.S., given the government’s current skepticism and fearmongering around mRNA vaccine technology.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Better but with a catch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial involved more than 18,000 healthy adult volunteers in the U.S., South Africa, and the Philippines. It took place over the course of the 2022 to 2023 flu season. People were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the experimental vaccine, dubbed modRNA, or Fluzone, a widely used inactivated flu vaccine made by Sanofi Pasteur. Both vaccines covered the four most common types of flu predicted to be circulating that season: two influenza A viruses and two influenza B viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There were noticeably fewer confirmed cases of influenza in the modRNA group compared to the control vaccine group (57 vs 87), the study showed. Overall, the modRNA vaccine was 34.5% more effective at preventing flu-like illness. The experimental vaccine also appeared to generate a higher antibody response to the influenza A strains and a similar response to the influenza B strains (nearly every confirmed flu case in the study was caused by influenza A).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This randomized trial showed that the modRNA vaccine provided both similar and improved prevention of a first episode of laboratory-confirmed influenza in adults between the ages of 18 and 64 years,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That added protection may come with some tradeoffs, however. People given modRNA reported more local reactions (70.1% vs. 43.1%) after their shot, such as injection site pain. They were also more likely to report systematic adverse events in general, such as fever (5.6% vs 1.7%).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This finding makes sense, since a vaccine’s adverse events are often linked to the immune response it generates. So a stronger immune response tends to cause more side effects. But while adverse events were more common in those who took modRNA, these events were still usually mild or moderate in severity. In the end, the study researchers concluded that the adverse event profiles of the two vaccines were similar.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The RFK Jr. wrinkle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All that said, the most serious hurdle to modRNA’s approval isn’t its potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, and his allies have systemically &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-buddies-are-back-to-undermine-vaccines-2000687069"&gt;undermined&lt;/a&gt; vaccines during the second Trump administration. Just this week, for instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cdc-website-now-boosts-debunked-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-2000688898"&gt;changed &lt;/a&gt;its website to boost the debunked myth that they cause autism. But as much as Kennedy and his buddies may mistrust vaccines in general, they have an especially strong hatred for mRNA vaccines, the newest type of vaccine that first saw wide use during the covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/robert-f-kennedy-jr-said-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-deadliest-vaccine-ever-made-thats-not-true/"&gt;(wrongly) stated&lt;/a&gt; that the mRNA covid-19 shots developed by Pfizer and Moderna were the “deadliest” vaccines ever created, for instance. Anti-vaccination advocates have also falsely claimed that mRNA vaccines are &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/parents-pack/parents-pack-newsletter/feature-article-are-mrna-vaccines-type-gene-therapy"&gt;gene therapies&lt;/a&gt;, that they &lt;a href="https://www.sierracounty.ca.gov/FAQ.aspx?QID=95"&gt;make people magnetic&lt;/a&gt;, and that they’re causing an explosion in cases of &lt;a href="https://globalvaccinedatanetwork.org/news/turbo_cancer_and_mrna_myth_that_defies_biology_and_physics"&gt;“turbo cancer.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These unsupported fears of mRNA vaccines have had real-world consequences. In May, Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/moderna-flu-covid-vaccine-fda-delay/746857/"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; the approval application for its combination flu/covid-19 vaccine (which also seemed to show &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/modernas-super-vaccine-for-flu-and-covid-works-now-politics-could-sink-it-2000599293"&gt;greater protection against flu&lt;/a&gt;) after the FDA asked for more data. In August, RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-yanks-500-million-from-critical-mrna-vaccine-research-2000639478"&gt;also pulled&lt;/a&gt; $500 million in federal funding for mRNA vaccine research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Contrary to claims from the anti-vaccination movement that mRNA vaccines are worse or more dangerous than other vaccines, this technology could actually strengthen our defenses against seasonal flu, and not just in terms of improved effectiveness. Since these vaccines typically take less time to tweak and produce than older types of vaccines, countries could wait longer to select the strains predicted to circulate during the season. That shortened lag could then prevent unexpected strains from causing a mismatch with the vaccine (a disastrous situation that’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-surprise-flu-variant-threw-off-the-vaccine-get-ready-for-a-brutal-winter-2000686095"&gt;now happening&lt;/a&gt; this winter).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderna has said that it will seek approval for its stand-alone flu shot next year. And given these latest results, Pfizer will undoubtedly apply for approval of its modRNA vaccine, too. Typically, both vaccines would seem to have an excellent chance of approval. But nothing is typical these days.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                Many people who take GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss experience unpleasant side effects. Brain scientists are trying to find ways to avoid them. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have shed pounds with help from drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But people who take these drugs often experience unpleasant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"They lose weight, which is a positive thing," says &lt;a href="https://medschool.umich.edu/profile/warren-yacawych" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Warren Yacawych&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Michigan, "but they experience such severe nausea and vomiting that patients stop treatment."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So at this year's Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, Yacawych and other researchers held a session to describe their efforts to understand and solve the side-effect problem.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The weight-loss products are called &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5587805/glp-1-ozempic-zepbound-gallup-obesity-rate" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They work by mimicking a hormone that reduces appetite and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yacawych and his colleagues wanted to know if they could tweak these drugs to suppress appetite without making people queasy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The team focused on two areas in the brain stem where GLP-1 drugs have a big effect.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first is affectionately known as the brain stem's vomit center," Yacawych says. "It's naturally designed to detect any accidentally ingested toxin and coordinate the feeling of nausea and the vomit response."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second area monitors food intake and tells people when they're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team found a way to direct GLP-1 to the area involved in feeling full, while keeping the drug out of the vomit center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers did this, the mice no longer felt sick. But they also didn't get thin — probably because there are specific cells in the vomit center that do not induce vomiting but are critical to weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So it's very challenging," Yacawych says, "to be able to separate these side effects, like nausea, from GLP-1's intended effects, like weight loss."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A possible workaround came from a team led by &lt;a href="https://endocrinology.uw.edu/people/faculty/blevins-j" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ernie Blevins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Washington. They gave obese rats a low dose of a GLP-1 drug along with the hormone &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/28/1152313319/a-new-study-casts-doubt-on-oxytocins-role-as-a-love-hormone" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;oxytocin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself an appetite suppressant. That allowed the rats to lose weight without feeling sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Not just nausea&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another side effect of GLP-1 drugs is a decrease in thirst, which could be dangerous for people who are already losing lots of fluids from side effects like vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"If you're in that state of dehydration and you're not feeling thirsty to replace those fluids, that would be a problem," says &lt;a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/DerekDaniels.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Derek Daniels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University at Buffalo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To understand how GLP-1 drugs reduce thirst, Daniels and a team began studying the brains of rats. And they got lucky.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We had a happy accident in the lab," Daniels says. "And the happy accident involved a rat called the &lt;a href="https://www.eneuro.org/content/3/2/ENEURO.0150-15.2016" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brattleboro rat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brattleboro rats are laboratory rodents with a genetic mutation that makes them thirsty nearly all the time. But the scientists discovered that these rats are also very sensitive to GLP-1 drugs, which drastically reduced their water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team studied the rats' brains to see where GLP-1 was influencing thirst. That led them to several areas of the brain that appear to affect thirst but not appetite.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The discovery could help scientists preserve thirst by designing drugs that "target good places but not bad places," Daniels says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Appetite and addiction&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Virginia found that GLP-1 drugs are already targeting a brain area that plays a role in addiction as well as eating. It's a region involved in emotion and the reward system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the researchers delivered GLP-1 to this brain area in mice, it reduced their desire for "rewarding food, like a burger," says &lt;a href="https://bio.as.virginia.edu/people/ali-d-guler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ali D. Güler&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the animals continued to eat healthy, nonrewarding foods, he says — a bit like people choosing a salad bar over dessert.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Identifying this brain area should help scientists find GLP-1 drugs that target the reward system while avoiding areas involved in appetite, Güler says. And that could lead to new treatments for alcoholism and other substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The finding also could explain the observation that people who take GLP-1 agonists tend to reduce their consumption of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Today, we have sophisticated medications – especially benzodiazepines – that people can use to help them with this panic. Benzodiazepines act fast, and can induce a calming or even euphoric high, which increases the risk of both psychological and physical dependence. But while benzodiazepines are relatively new, panic is very old. So what did humans in other times, civilisations and settings do when they panicked?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who experienced panic attacks got burned as witches or accused of being possessed by demons or evil spirits. But it’s also true that the beginnings of a more clinical understanding of panic weren’t as far off as you might think. Greek physicians, such as Hippocrates in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;5th century BCE,&lt;/span&gt; described symptoms resembling modern panic attacks – such as heart palpitations, dizziness, and fainting – but &lt;a href="https://clinical-practice-and-epidemiology-in-mental-health.com/VOLUME/8/PAGE/110/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;classified&lt;/a&gt; them under a broader condition known as ‘hysteria’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, in &lt;em&gt;The Canon of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (1025) – yes, 1025 – Avicenna (Ibn Sina), described forms of sudden fear and anxiety as part of neuropsychological disorders. Though his explanations still blended physical and spiritual reasoning, his work laid the foundation for a more nuanced understanding of mental health. He wrote: ‘The movements of the soul begin in the heart and manifest in the body,’ suggesting a deep interconnection between mind and physiology. Ibn Sina also discussed what we would now call psychosomatic illness, noting that ‘strong emotions may alter the pulse and colour of the face.’ His holistic view – that emotional and spiritual states directly influence physical health – anticipated principles of modern psychosomatic medicine by nearly a millennium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-newsletter-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;bn Sina is just one of many figures from the past who have gained or contributed real insight into treating mental illness, long before modern medicine. Take trepanation, for example – the act of drilling, scraping or cutting a hole into the human skull, while the person is still alive. While this practice wasn’t effective in treating panic attacks or other mental disorders, it may have been successful in nearly half of the cases when applied to physical conditions such as intracranial pressure. We still use a modernised version of trepanation today, known as a craniectomy, to relieve pressure inside the skull – just with better tools and sterile environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to panic attacks, though, force has never really been the answer. Across many cultures, the most effective approach has been to help the mind – or, as Islamic psychology often refers to it, the heart – relax. And for most people, that meant simply &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;cheering up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many peoples and societies have understood that ‘cheering up’ is intimately tied to the senses – especially the ears and eyes. Listening to something soothing often brings comfort. Seeing calming or familiar patterns can promote relaxation. In some cases, an intense or activating sensory pattern might be used to snap someone out of their panicked state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The ritual provides a structured space for emotional release, and reframes suffering as meaningful rather than shameful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, for many centuries, across the Horn of Africa and in parts of the Middle East such as Egypt and Yemen, the Zār ritual has been a communal healing ceremony practised primarily by women. It &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4801492/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;addresses&lt;/a&gt; symptoms that closely resemble modern diagnoses of panic and anxiety disorders: shortness of breath, chest tightness, trembling, and dissociative episodes. But, instead of labelling these experiences as purely psychological, the Zār tradition interprets them as signs of possession by a restless spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The afflicted person, usually a woman – often someone burdened by emotional or social constraints – becomes the focus of an intense, rhythmic ceremony involving drumming, incense, dancing and chanting. She may enter a trance, during which she might shake, weep or speak in a different voice – seen as the spirit expressing itself. Yet, beneath the surface, the ritual serves a powerful psychological purpose: it provides a structured space for emotional release, community validation, and a reframing of suffering as meaningful rather than shameful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And away from Africa, among the Evenki people of Siberia, shamans have also long used drumming, chanting and trance to address what psychiatry might call panic, dissociation or trauma. A person experiencing intense fear, recurring visions or emotional paralysis wouldn’t be labelled as mentally ill, but rather as someone &lt;a href="https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ac.2001.12.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;being&lt;/a&gt; ‘called by the spirits’. In a sacred ritual, the shaman uses a large, oval drum – or the ‘spirit horse’ – to enter a trance, sometimes bringing the distressed person into it as well. Within this state, the individual can personify their fear and begin to reintegrate the experience through story, rhythm and movement. Far from isolating the person, the community embraces the event as meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ancient Egypt too, healing was never merely physical – it was ritual, musical and symbolic. Even when symptoms appeared purely physical, Egyptian physicians often spoke of ‘heart sadness’ as a possible cause of cardiovascular distress, describing conditions where ‘the vessels of the heart close up within.’ One of the earliest known medical texts, the Ebers Papyrus (&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;1550 BCE), &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13070860" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mentions&lt;/a&gt; treatments for ‘the trembling of the heart’, likely referring to anxiety-like episodes. Healing took place in sacred sites, where repetition, rhythm and fragrance worked together to restore harmony between the body and the &lt;em&gt;ka&lt;/em&gt;, the vital spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;What if we re-centred rhythm, sensory input and non-addictive methods of calming the mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you see a pattern? Exactly – it’s the pattern itself. All those older methods of treatment relied heavily on rhythm, sound, visual stimulation and community support. These elements weren’t just cultural flourishes – they were essential parts of the healing process. And yet, in many of our modern treatments, they’re largely absent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, some studies of benzodiazepines &lt;a href="https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcp.12023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; dependence in &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;15 per&lt;/span&gt; cent to &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;44 per&lt;/span&gt; cent of long-term users, depending on dosage, duration and individual history, after just three to six weeks of daily use. Withdrawal can be brutal – bringing rebound anxiety, panic attacks, tremors and, in rare cases, seizures. Some studies even suggest a troubling connection between long-term benzodiazepine use and later misuse of opioids or alcohol, particularly in vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this raises a critical question: what if we went back – not in time, but in principle? What if we re-centred rhythm, sensory input and non-addictive methods of calming the mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n 2024, I worked on a brain research &lt;a href="https://research-archive.org/index.php/rars/preprint/view/1542/version/1682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; with Mayar Ashraf that explores the use of sleep-wave simulation as a treatment for panic attacks. Sleep waves are patterns of electrical activity in the brain that occur during various stages of sleep. We can measure them using electroencephalography (EEG). These waves reflect different levels of brain activity – some deep and slow, others light and fast. We looked at whether brainwave entrainment – via external auditory and visual patterns mimicking sleep frequencies – could coax the brain into calmer states. Though still under investigation, this approach resembles a modernised form of what our African ancestors once achieved with drums, chanting and trance. But, this time, it’s not about spirits – it’s about neurons. Still, the wisdom has some similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A growing number of clinical psychologists today are using group-based rhythmic breathing sessions, sometimes combined with drumming or humming, to help patients with panic and anxiety disorders. One such method, inspired by Indigenous healing ceremonies, is holotropic breathwork, a structured, fast-paced &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-breathe-your-way-to-better-health-and-transcendence" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;breathing technique&lt;/a&gt; developed in the United States in the 1970s by the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof. Holotropic breathwork draws on shamanic and spiritual traditions found among Indigenous peoples of the Amazon Basin, Native North American tribes and Central Asian steppe cultures, where rhythmic drumming, breath control and chanting were used to reach altered states of consciousness for healing and emotional release. Participants lie on mats in a calm, darkened space, breathe rhythmically to steady drumming or music, and are encouraged to express whatever arises – crying, shaking and vocal release are all allowed. Facilitators provide guidance throughout the ritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="lg:-ml-[150px] font-body max-sm:my-12 sm:float-start sm:max-w-[370px] sm:pr-10 sm:pb-10 lg:pl-10 print:hidden

class="pointer-coarse:-inset-4 -inset-1 absolute"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holotropic breathwork remains controversial in mainstream psychiatry, but a return to sensory and communal modes of healing isn’t regression – it’s reintegration. Science can learn from human history without abandoning clinical rigour, and recognise that ancient practices often held empirical truths, as well as misinterpretations. What Hippocrates observed as hysteria, and what shamans believed was a spiritual crisis, may very well map on to what we now understand as nervous system dysregulation. Rhythm, movement and sound work not because of magic, but because they engage the vagus nerve, stimulate neuroplasticity, and restore balance to an overwhelmed brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, imagine yourself back in that ancient setting – but now with EEG caps and signal processors alongside incense and drums. The future of treating panic might lie not in the time fight between the past and the present, but in understanding how both can satisfy the same human need: to feel safe, seen and soothed. In that sense, history isn’t just a backdrop to research on panic – it’s a map.

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A year ago, the federal Indian Health Service posted dozens of flyers on Facebook promoting flu and COVID-19 vaccine clinics across the Navajo Nation, where the pandemic had inflicted a staggering toll just a few years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The notices, featuring photos of smiling families and elders in traditional clothing, tied immunization to tribal values like community responsibility and made a clear case for getting the shots. “Vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness or hospitalization,” one of them said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this year, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic, has put his stamp on federal immunization policy, IHS’ public messaging on vaccines has taken a stark turn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In internal emails obtained by ProPublica, IHS officials have flagged terms such as “immunizations” and “vaccines” for additional scrutiny, deeming them risky “buzzwords” that require approval from agency public information officers to be used in social media posts, pamphlets and presentations for patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through mid-October, IHS had published far fewer posts on Facebook promoting vaccine clinics this year than last, ProPublica found. And in those posts as well as other notices, it replaced language touting immunization’s benefits with wording that frames both routine childhood vaccinations and annual flu and COVID-19 shots as a personal choice, advising patients to consult health care providers about their “options regarding vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current and former IHS clinicians told ProPublica the changes threaten vaccine uptake in Navajo communities and have left medical practitioners who serve this population feeling censored.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It seems to me that they’re trying to put up barriers,” said Harry Brown, a physician and epidemiologist who left IHS in 2016 and now works for a tribally operated health facility in North Carolina. In a 26-year career with IHS, he said, he had never encountered an effort to stifle public health campaigns or restrict what medical providers said publicly about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aside from Brown, the health care providers who spoke with ProPublica didn’t want their names used, concerned it could endanger their jobs. One physician said the new IHS restrictions on vaccine-related speech factored into her decision to leave the agency this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I can’t keep people safe,” she said in an interview just before she quit. “I don’t have any of the words anymore to say anything I need to say.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IHS’ shift in vaccine messaging has not been previously reported but aligns with widely publicized changes within the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy’s leadership. In the past 10 months, as measles cases have hit their highest levels in decades, Kennedy has been tepid in endorsing the vaccine to prevent the disease while taking several steps critics predict will undermine public confidence in immunization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He’s launched a federal probe into scientifically debunked links between immunizations and autism and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/05/health/rfk-jr-vaccine-funding.html"&gt;canceled nearly $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in contracts and research grants for mRNA vaccines. This technology was central to the speedy development of the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, he removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy, replacing them with his own appointments, including several vaccine skeptics. Kennedy has also endorsed &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-vaccine-bill-medical-freedom-act-maha"&gt;the founders of Idaho’s medical freedom movement&lt;/a&gt;, who helped persuade the state to ban vaccine mandates this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At IHS, the only branch of HHS that operates its own network of hospitals and clinics, the altered federal landscape on vaccine policy has had a more direct effect on patient care, clinicians said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement, an HHS spokesperson said the redrafting of IHS’ public messaging materials was designed to encourage “shared decision-making” between patients and their health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The Indian Health Service continues to provide accurate, evidence-based information on vaccines and infectious-disease prevention,” the statement said. “Our focus remains ensuring Tribal communities have clear, trusted guidance and access to the care they choose.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The statement didn’t address questions about what prompted the revamped messaging or concerns raised by doctors about its potential effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement, Matthew Clark, the IHS’ deputy chief medical officer, insisted the agency’s approach to immunizations has remained consistent, even if its messaging about them has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We continue to advocate that every patient at every encounter be offered every FDA-approved and ACIP-recommended vaccine, when appropriate,” Clark’s statement said.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear yet what effect the changes are having. Data hasn’t been released showing this season’s flu and COVID-19 vaccination rates for the Navajo Nation. Through September, the uptake rate for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as MMR, for 2-year-olds has held steady at around 95%, the level of herd immunity needed to prevent outbreaks, IHS data shows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, IHS clinicians said, the agency’s lack of public messaging about vaccines was especially notable during the winter and spring, when a measles outbreak emerged in Texas and then neared the reservation’s borders in New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak had spurred alarm. Tribal health facilities, which operate independently from IHS, flooded Facebook with information about MMR shots at the end of February and urged residents to get themselves and their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet two IHS doctors said that at about the same time, the agency installed its new restrictions on vaccine-related speech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a March 13 email that Ryan Goldtooth, a public information officer at one Navajo Nation hospital, sent to colleagues, members of the group had been instructed to take down social media posts or flyers that contained the terms “vaccines (namely Measles)” and “immunizations” from the agency’s Facebook pages. “We cannot forward or post to the public,” the email said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email also said that the terms “immunizations” and “vaccines” had been reclassified “from low to medium-risk.” As a result, if clinicians used these words in public presentations and printed materials, they needed to be cleared by a public information officer first, Goldtooth wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The email listed several other topics or types of information that could no longer be freely shared or talked about publicly. Starting from the date President Donald Trump returned to office, any information shared from a state health department, for instance, had to be removed from Facebook, the email said, without providing a reason. Any posts about executive orders also had to come down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Goldtooth, who still works for IHS, did not respond to requests for comment about the email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Laura Hammitt, the director of infectious disease programs for the Center for Indigenous Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, has worked closely with IHS staffers on vaccination efforts. Limiting what they can say about vaccines could harm their ability to respond to future outbreaks, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People are really trying to be compliant with changes required by the administration but also have a responsibility to care for their patients,” Hammitt said. “Those two things can seem to be at odds.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Navajo Nation, the country’s largest tribal jurisdiction with around 170,000 residents, has long been a focal point and challenge for IHS. The reservation is served by four of the agency’s 22 hospitals, but pockets within its 27,000 square miles of mountains and high desert have no cellphone service, internet access or electricity, creating hurdles for clinicians when it comes to communicating information and delivering care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These structural issues had a devastating effect at the start of the pandemic, when the reservation’s rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths were among the highest in the country. The virus claimed the lives of at least &lt;a href="https://nec.navajo-nsn.gov/Data-Dashboard/COVID-19"&gt;2,300 Navajo citizens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In the previous decade, vaccination rates among Navajos, especially for MMR and the flu, had regularly exceeded figures for the nation overall. They also exceeded rates for tribal communities in other regions served by IHS, which typically lagged behind the national average, according to the agency’s data. When the COVID-19 vaccine arrived in 2021, Native Americans’ uptake exceeded 60%, an effort bolstered by IHS public service messages and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Navajo Nation, IHS hospitals posted messages on their Facebook pages and circulated flyers that pushed community members to get the shots. “Protect yourself, protect your family, protect your elders,” the flyers said. Tribal members responded, arriving at clinics in droves, lining up in their vehicles to get vaccinated at hospitals and clinics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who couldn’t travel to larger towns on the reservation that had health care facilities, teams working for IHS, the tribe and Johns Hopkins set up mobile clinics and made home visits to especially remote communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, IHS and tribal teams on the Navajo Nation sought to extend the COVID-19 shot success to routine vaccines. MMR immunization rates among 2-year-olds had dropped to 85%, but another coordinated effort restored communities on the reservation to prepandemic levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IHS was the engine driving the campaign, said Hammitt, the Johns Hopkins doctor. Agency flyers and Facebook posts retooled appeals used to promote COVID-19 shots to endorse the MMR vaccine, adding a call to protect “future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the first few months of this year, however, the messaging began to morph again, with mentions of “measles” and “COVID” disappearing from IHS social media pages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The weeks leading up to flu season and the new school year typically usher in a robust vaccine campaign in IHS hospitals. But this year, doctors took note of how few notices went out, they said, as New Mexico continued to contend with the measles outbreak that began in Texas and the Navajo Nation encountered a late-summer surge in COVID-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One exception came in May, when IHS officials shared a New Mexico Department of Health alert on Facebook saying measles had reached Sandoval County, which overlaps with the eastern flank of the Navajo reservation. Another came that same month, when the IHS hospital in the town of Gallup, New Mexico, announced a clinic for people who wanted to get vaccinated for measles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IHS hospital in Shiprock, New Mexico, was the only facility to post a public service announcement about a back-to-school vaccine clinic for children. It included language telling patients to talk to doctors about their options and didn’t specifically mention measles, COVID-19 or any other infectious disease as such announcements had in the past.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another measles outbreak surfaced in the Southwest in mid-August, this time just to the west of the Navajo Nation along the Arizona-Utah border. In early November, it had grown to at least 200 confirmed cases, according to Arizona and Utah health officials. IHS didn’t issue any advisories or notices on Facebook about this outbreak. The new approval processes for greenlighting public health alerts slowed down local administrators’ and hospitals’ response, the clinicians who spoke to ProPublica noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several clinicians said the restrictions on vaccine-related speech alter the relationship between IHS doctors and patients, even if they apply only to public communications and not to one-on-one consultations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is what we do for a living, and the most important thing we do is explain what’s going on to patients,” one of the doctors said. “If there is an external body interfering with that, as there is now, then that is shaping the fundamental trust between patients and the people trying to provide their care.”&lt;/p&gt;

These were some of the effects that Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, a French physiologist, reported to a Société de Biologie of Paris meeting in 1889. He had been injecting himself with a liquid made of pulverized animal testicles in an attempt to reverse “the most troublesome miseries of advanced life.” He took 10 injections over three weeks, and experienced “radical change” for about a month after.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is hardly possible to explain the effects I have observed on myself otherwise than by admitting that the liquid injected possesses the power of increasing the strength of many parts of the human organism,” he told the gathering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large number of physicians followed his lead, injecting patients with animal testicular fluids, and the so-called Brown-Séquard Elixir became a sensation. Thousands of men, including Pittsburgh baseball pitcher &lt;a href="https://deadspin.com/meet-pud-galvin-the-monkey-testicle-drinking-rebuttal-5975407/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;James “Pud” Galvin&lt;/a&gt;, an early dabbler in performance-enhancing drugs, felt their virility was restored. &lt;a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn84024546/1889-08-13/ed-1/?sp=1&amp;amp;q=Brown+Brown-Sequard+Elixir+elixir+Sequard&amp;amp;r=0.423,0.378,0.627,0.328,0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Newspapers reported&lt;/a&gt; on patients getting rid of their crutches immediately after injections, and in &lt;a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn86072173/1889-08-10/ed-1/?sp=1&amp;amp;q=jim+galvin+brown-sequard&amp;amp;r=0.09%2C0.472%2C0.546%2C0.285%2C0&amp;amp;st=text" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one case a man of 70&lt;/a&gt;, suffering from rheumatism, started “dancing and jumping about like a boy since the treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sounds a lot like testosterone therapy. Except, there was barely any testosterone — in fact, barely anything at all — in the injections. The results, studies have confirmed, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12463999/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;were placebo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there is good reason for Brown-Séquard’s injections to make one think of the mushrooming industry of male health clinics trumpeting testosterone therapy. They, &lt;a href="https://gamedaymenshealth.com/manhattan/low-testosterone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;too, promise men&lt;/a&gt; results including “increased stamina and endurance,” “improved cognitive abilities,” and “increased sense of well-being” — for many men, they appear to embody the latest iteration of the elusive fountain of male youth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike Brown-Séquard’s elixir though, testosterone is not nothing. And the millions of men who report great benefits from testosterone supplementation, powering a market projected &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/testosterone-replacement-therapy-trt-market-140000529.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAN4ZEZ0Juth2ZP1jRn6Ll_101qKbjRpB428t_1unygdkYvjuh3uUx87nvNckmlA_xEOoU8ReWYtWg5FqYtNc_padJT8sYAUHAktv-LEvsWT_jwLqevakphHzZeiGTNy7QTw1KhdV9wX3tB_JHcPe8LvUN0Fri7UqhTLwFe5LY0mx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;to reach $2.5 billion&lt;/a&gt;, can’t all be experiencing placebo effects. While the hormone is sometimes prescribed to men who don’t need it, there’s more to the proliferation of prescription-happy men’s health clinics than reckless medical practices and influencer hype, say physicians who understand its value for some men. It’s also a sign of the health care system’s lack of regard for male sexual hormones and their role in health; many primary care doctors learned little about hormone therapy in medical school and haven’t kept up with the research on testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That research shows that when the symptoms patients complain about — be it fatigue, low libido, or mood disorders — are caused by low testosterone, replacement therapy through gels, pellets, or more often, injections is typically successful in alleviating their symptoms. And with medical guidance and monitoring, side effects, which include testicular shrinkage, reduced sperm production, and breast tissue enlargement, can be controlled. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We tend to talk about the lengths that men go to as if this is worthy of ridicule, that men would undergo procedures or take elixirs or whatever it is, all seeking to preserve their youth,” said Abraham Morgentaler, a urologist who has been studying testosterone deficiency since the 1970s, and is currently a Blavatnik faculty fellow in health and longevity at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Men who are feeling fatigued, depressed, and generally unwell may find that mainstream medical practices often don’t as much as acknowledge their symptoms as worthy of investigation, let alone engage with the hypothesis low testosterone may be at play. Major physician groups also give conflicting guidance on when testosterone levels are low and therapy is warranted. And so, men look elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-mainstream-medicine-falls-short"&gt;Where mainstream medicine falls short&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peek into any of the online forums dedicated to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;testosterone replacement &lt;/a&gt;— typically, rabbit hole after rabbit hole of studies, lab results, injection routines, treatment protocols — and you will easily find patients questioning their primary care physicians’ knowledge of testosterone therapy, and ready to bypass their advice for the tempting lure of a testosterone clinic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Doctors didn’t dive into this at all — and this includes endocrinologists,” said Garrett Soames, a physician assistant and co-founder and chief medical officer of Alpha MD, an online clinic providing testosterone therapy as a monthly subscription. Soames is proud to be on testosterone himself. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morgentaler said “the online comments that the doctors don’t know anything about [testosterone] are accurate, and I can’t tell you how often in my career I’ve had patients come see me who’ve gone from doctor to doctor and [they] have been told that testosterone deficiency and testosterone therapy represent fringe medicine … Many of those patients are deficient in testosterone and respond very nicely to treatment.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several patients who eventually started testosterone therapy told STAT they felt that their doctors weren’t familiar with testosterone replacement, or were unwilling to support them and monitor their results. “My primary care doctors — I had two because I moved — both said the same thing: ‘You don’t really need to test that, you’re fine’,” said Dan B., 43, who had complained about feeling lethargic and in a low mood. (Like many of the men interviewed for this article, he asked STAT not to use his full name to protect his privacy.)&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One physician told him the absence of erectile dysfunction was proof he was not testosterone deficient, though that isn’t a diagnostic criteria. He eventually got his total testosterone tested anyway, finding levels around 300 nanograms per deciliter — barely above the cutoff for hypogonadism (testosterone deficiency, in endocrinology-speak), and at a level that, combined with symptoms of fatigue, could justify testosterone therapy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that his testosterone is higher, he says he has more energy and feels sharper: “I feel more focused when I’m doing things, and you just have an overall better sense of well-being. You feel like your emotional state is more even-keeled.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when his online research prompted J.S., a 72-year-old man living in Seattle, to ask his primary care physician about testosterone testing because of fatigue, “his follow-up questions proved to me that he had no idea whatsoever about testosterone therapy,” he said. He eventually did find he had low levels of testosterone, and has been in treatment for about a year. “To simply say that my strength and endurance have improved considerably does not communicate the extent of the difference,” he said. “I simply feel like a younger version of myself.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-it-s-t-time-why-testosterone-has-become-so-popular"&gt;It’s T time: why testosterone has become so popular&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The amount of online chatter about testosterone is echoed in doctors’ offices. Providers report seeing many more patients who are inquiring about their testosterone levels, and diagnosing more with hypogonadism. And though the overall number of prescriptions for testosterone remains small — about 2 in 100,000 prescriptions, according to &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/research/fill-rate-for-testosterone-by-age-and-sex" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data from GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; — the scripts for testosterone cypionate, the injectable form, doubled between 2019 and 2025. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rise in patients presenting with low testosterone is due to many factors, said John Mulhall, director of sexual and reproductive medicine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and chair of the American Urology Association testosterone guidelines committee, including more awareness of hypogonadism symptoms and an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7063751/#:~:text=2018).-,Results,p%20%E2%88%92%20value%20%3C%200.001)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;established decline&lt;/a&gt; in testosterone levels in men that’s yet to be attributed to a clear cause. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plus in the U.S., “there is incredible availability of testosterone products,” he said, noting there are 17 on his hospital’s list. “So the utilization of testosterone therapy in America is far greater than in other places in the world, including continental Europe.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time testosterone treatment has hit the zeitgeist. The recent trend mirrors the sudden popularity testosterone in the aughts after the launch of AndroGel, the first testosterone product to receive Food and Drug Administration approval, in 2000. In 2002, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the company behind AndroGel (which was later sold to AbbVie), struck marketing gold: It rebranded andropause (the decline of testosterone due to age) with a grabbier label — “low T” — and invested in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2612615?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;direct-to-consumer advertising&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/business/selling-that-new-man-feeling.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;awareness campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sales skyrocketed despite the FDA calling for caution and asking that all testosterone products carry a warning about increased risk &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-cautions-about-using-testosterone-products-low-testosterone-due" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;of cardiovascular events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(The warning was removed earlier this year after the large &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2215025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TRAVERSE trial&lt;/a&gt; provided evidence that there is no added risk of those conditions, even as there can be other concerning side effects, especially for younger people, such as infertility.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Things cooled down with T for a few years, until something else pushed the market beyond any previous records: Covid. Or rather, the widespread &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8604198/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;adoption of telemedicine&lt;/a&gt;. Testosterone is a controlled substance, though the limitations on who can prescribe it in person are pretty loose: Most health care professionals, including&lt;a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugreg/practioners/practioners.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; mid-level practitioners&lt;/a&gt; such as midwives or physician assistants, can do so, as long as they’re licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remote prescriptions are subject to stricter rules, and are allowed only after at least one in-person visit, but those restrictions have been relaxed since the pandemic, and exceptions have been renewed four times since the end of the emergency period. Currently, they are &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/11/covid-era-rules-for-addiction-medication-ritalin-are-extended-again/"&gt;set to expire in December 2026.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the internet isn’t just the place to get testosterone: It is also where an army of male health influencers tout its benefits. Podcaster &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEce1DRsRwQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; has been broadcasting the “big difference” it made in his life to his millions of followers for years. Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has listed testosterone shots as part of his anti-aging protocol, and celebrities including &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a43736992/robbie-williams-opens-up-about-sex-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Robbie Williams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://people.com/josh-duhamel-says-he-takes-testosterone-to-stay-virile-for-his-wife-audra-mari-11754769?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Josh Duhamel,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a46189803/alan-ritchson-jack-reacher-testosterone-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alan Ritchson&lt;/a&gt; have discussed their use of testosterone treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A toe dip into TikTok or other social media will surface a long list of influencer accounts discussing testosterone benefits and testosterone boosting techniques of various levels of scientific substance: “Low testosterone is the cause of 99% of male problems,” says one influencer &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marcel.stam/video/7295692909456723218?q=t%20maxxing&amp;amp;t=1762279242901" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a popular video&lt;/a&gt;. “Up your egg intake, however many eggs you’re eating now, times ten.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Men are looking for answers to why they have fatigue, why they have low libido, why they have erectile dysfunction, and the narrative has become that testosterone is the root cause of all of these symptoms, which it usually isn’t,” said Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who specializes in androgens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if the people going viral with their T content may be misguided and misguiding, the effects of their presence is being felt in the number of men who have become aware of testosterone treatment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diagnosing-testosterone-deficiency-it-s-complicated"&gt;Diagnosing testosterone deficiency: It’s complicated&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For men who are testosterone curious — because they experience some of the symptoms of low testosterone, or have encountered online content promoting T — learning their testosterone levels, and potentially starting treatment, is not straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis and treatment of testosterone deficiency requires two elements: the presence of symptoms, and low blood values of the hormone. This is where some of the trouble begins. The symptoms can be plentiful — fatigue, lack of libido, brain fog, low mood, erectile dysfunction — but they are hard to irrefutably attribute to lack of testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For one, the cut-off levels for blood tests vary: For the American Urological Association, total testosterone &lt;a href="https://www.auanet.org/guidelines-and-quality/guidelines/testosterone-deficiency-guideline" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;values below 300 ng/dL&lt;/a&gt; indicate testosterone deficiency; for the American Endocrine Society, hypogonadism is defined by total testosterone values below 264 ng/dL; and for the European Association of Urology, the cut-off is 350 ng/dL (although there isn’t consensus in Europe, either). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To complicate things, testosterone levels can vary dramatically during the course of a day, or from one day to the next. And even someone who does not suffer from testosterone deficiency may dip below the threshold from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if someone has symptoms that could be attributed to low testosterone, when are they a good candidate for testosterone treatment? Is someone whose testosterone hovers just above the cut-off, with levels that would not be considered sufficient had they been the result of testosterone treatment, a good candidate? Are aging men, who lose about 1% of total testosterone every year after 30, fatigued by decades of life or in need of a testosterone top up? Is a man whose relative testosterone level has gone down significantly, while staying within the normal range, going to benefit from testosterone injections?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I very much am against treating lab values,” said Larry Lipshultz, professor of urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. By way of illustration, he mentioned a patient of his who is an athlete and in treatment for low testosterone. Due to regulation, he is only allowed a limited dose, even though it is not sufficient to ease his symptoms, and while his levels are fine based on lab results alone, as a 6-foot-8, 350-pound man, Lipshultz believes he would greatly benefit from higher testosterone supplementation. “A good physician is going to evaluate not only the lab values but the patient’s symptoms,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is yet another tricky aspect to interpreting test results. Two testosterone metrics are typically measured in the blood: total testosterone, which includes all testosterone bound to proteins, which isn’t available to the body until it is released; and free testosterone, the active form. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The endocrinology community has not yet fully embraced this idea that free testosterone is more important than total testosterone, and yet the evidence, both clinically and scientifically, is clear,” said Morgentaler, pointing to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33014416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published literature&lt;/a&gt; on the subject, including studies finding hypogonadism in men with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26909800/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sufficient total testosterone&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17087806/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;symptoms of low testosterone&lt;/a&gt; correlate more with low free than low total testosterone.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t beyond debate, however. “Free testosterone can be useful in certain scenarios but most of the time if a serum total testosterone is normal, this is a good rule-out test,” said Raul Herrera Pena, an endocrinologist at the University of Minnesota. Further, said Irwig, “some of the assays for free testosterone are not that accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between different measures of testosterone, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17100942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a wide variety&lt;/a&gt; of assays, identifying who would benefit from testosterone treatment can be challenging, and primary care physicians may not feel comfortable making the diagnosis or prescribing treatment. There are, too, lingering misconceptions about the safety of testosterone therapy, including now-dispelled fears of cardiovascular events and &lt;a href="https://www.epicresearch.org/articles/no-correlation-found-between-testicular-cancer-and-testosterone-replacement-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;testicular&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4647137/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;, as well as hesitancy to prescribe controlled substances. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Urologists and endocrinologists are better positioned to identify and treat patients who could benefit, but approaches vary there, too. For instance, urologists may be more inclined than endocrinologists to try testosterone even when the test results don’t meet the exact cut-off levels, because “we treat often symptoms that may not have an associated blood test,” such as erectile dysfunction, said Morgentaler, himself a urologist. Endocrinologists, on the other hand, may be more focused on balancing hormonal levels, and less inclined to prescribe medication. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Different doctors may have different philosophies of treatment, too, which comes into play especially when low testosterone is more of a symptom. For instance, if a man who has obesity feels fatigued, or has low libido, his doctor may well find that his testosterone levels are low. But they may want to address the obesity first — which is likely the cause of low testosterone — rather than immediately prescribe testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If it’s something that is treated with weight loss, that should be done first,” said Adrian Dobs, an endocrinologist and professor of medicine and oncology at Johns Hopkins University. “There may be a reason to give with testosterone, but I think you just have to be careful not to jump on it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Others have a different approach. “I don’t want to be a purist about saying no, I won’t give you testosterone because you’re overweight and that’s the cause,” said Lipshultz. Morgenthaler said it’s moralizing to not give patients testosterone until they make lifestyle changes. “I will treat men even if they are obese and not working out,” he said. “Everyone who’s overweight knows he’s overweight and is supposed to diet and exercise. There’s no value in my being the 27th person to tell them this.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s no wonder, then, that many men are embracing a simpler alternative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-click-here-for-testosterone"&gt;‘Click here for testosterone’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Enter testosterone clinics — providers focused on male health, often with evocative names such as DudeMeds, MaleExcel, Maximus, Titan — where the pendulum has swung all the way to the other side. Their patients typically can bypass traditional physician or specialist visits. A potential customer may get their testosterone levels tested through at-home tests, or sometimes not at all, and are often offered a prescription even if their lab values don’t align with established diagnostic criteria. Testosterone is then delivered to their home — for a monthly fee ranging from under $100 to several hundred dollars a month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alphamd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Alpha MD&lt;/a&gt;, one such clinic, serves many thousands of patients around the country through about 10 providers, who Soames says all take testosterone themselves. “We all kind of have been through the runaround. We’ve all experienced being denied by our doctors,” he said. Typically, Alpha MD patients, too, have been turned away from their physicians, who either didn’t think they needed their testosterone levels tested, or found them to be sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In our practice, we turn away or deny about 10% of patients,” he said, usually ones whose testosterone levels are already at the high end of the range and are more likely to experience concerning side effects of excess testosterone, in particular erythrocytosis — increased red cell count.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their business is booming, and so is their industry overall. A 2023 study of men’s online health clinics providing testosterone therapy identified &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0090429523000730#:~:text=A%20total%20of%20297%20DTC,CONCLUSIONS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;223 online clinics&lt;/a&gt;, of which a third had multiple physical locations, too. The numbers have only gone up. A &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2025/07/08/american-men-are-hungry-for-injectable-testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported 325 new clinics&lt;/a&gt; with several locations and online presence have opened since early 2024, and although there is no unified registry of clinics offering testosterone, the total number may well be in the thousands. And now, some of the bigger players in telehealth prescribing — Ro, Hims, Hone — have entered the field, or &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-10/hims-to-launch-new-offerings-for-men-with-low-testosterone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are planning to&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be sure, online clinics aren’t the ideal solution to the challenges of getting testosterone. Lack of proper oversight, a bias toward prescribing (as it’s the basis of the business model), even to men who may not need it, and inadequate education about possible side effects worry experts and make many patients uneasy, though they are willing to take the risk to find treatment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soames says his clinic is changing lives, the way testosterone changed his, and claims its providers — who are primarily not physicians — have better knowledge and understanding of the workings of testosterone than most doctors. For instance, he said, one criteria they use to decide whether a patient would benefit from testosterone is “relative hypogonadism,” which means someone’s testosterone is in the normal range, but lower than what it used to be. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many experts in hormonal health are skeptical of such an approach because testosterone levels fluctuate greatly even in a single day, so it would be hard to establish a baseline. Unsurprisingly, these experts are more broadly critical of online testosterone clinics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of clinics that are just out to make money,” said Irwig. “They’re not taking good histories, they’re often not even doing physical exams, they’re not even counseling patients about possible side effects … they’re just eager to enroll them in programs where they’re selling them testosterone.” He added that he knows of clinics that tell men a testosterone level of 400 or 500 ng/dL is low when it’s not. Men with such levels who report feeling better after testosterone therapy are probably experiencing the placebo effect, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patients also lament the minimal oversight at some clinics. As one wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/users/69175907ef3d6c4aafc58b87" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;online review&lt;/a&gt;: “My only phone call with the physician to begin my TRT last[ed] about 20 seconds. It went like this: ‘I’ve seen your blood work and you qualify for TRT. You can go online and place your order. Any questions?’ Not the experience I was hoping for.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Herrera Pena, the Minnesota endocrinologist, said he is especially worried by the lack of thorough lab workup to carefully diagnose testosterone deficiency, as well as identify any underlying cause of such deficiency. Further, he said, when patients who have been going to online clinics come to him, they often use higher doses than recommended in standard medical practice. “I always tell people, be careful when you’re going to a cash pay clinic, just be careful on what they’re selling to you.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are significant health risks, too, beyond red cell count. They include infertility, which is especially concerning for younger men. External testosterone reduces the body’s own production of the hormone, which can lead to low sperm count. Reversing these effects can take several months to more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asima Ahmad, a reproductive endocrinologist at the Reproductive Medicine Institute in Chicago, and the chief medical officer and co-founder of fertility platform Carrot Fertility, says she is seeing an increase in infertile men as a consequence of unnecessary testosterone therapy. “It’s not like it’s a random occurrence, it happens very frequently,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another side effect, gynecomastia, or enlarged breasts, can subside with time or medications, but in some cases surgery is required. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In forums about testosterone, men also complain of anxiety and insomnia, irritability, hypertension, and acne, and even mention being scared of getting off T for fear of a rebound. Indeed, when the body gets used to unnaturally high levels of testosterone, said Irwig, “when they try to come off, they can have a lot of symptoms … and then they go back on the substances and it’s kind of a vicious cycle.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, while some patients would prefer to get care from their own physicians, they feel they have little choice. “If this kind of treatment was available through my regular doctor, I would change clinics in a second, because it would make me feel safer,” said Luca Candela, 47, who said he only receives “perfunctory” control visits from his clinic. “But I can’t, and the improvement of my quality of life has been so substantial that I don’t want to stop.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicians such as Mulhall, the Memorial Sloan Kettering urologist, have a similar view. “There is a population that could benefit from testosterone treatment and it’s still not encouraged to do it,” he said. “I would say that number is far larger than the men who are inappropriately on testosterone.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morgentaler agrees. “My concern is that there are a lot of men who are getting [testosterone] who don’t need it, but tragically, there’s more of the men who actually need it [who] aren’t getting treated at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

A week of bad sleep that feels unusual, sharper mood swings than before, a sudden dip in energy that does not match your routine. Many women in their twenties and early thirties brush these changes aside, blaming long workdays or stress. Yet these subtle shifts can sometimes be early clues of hormonal transition. Hidden menopause symptoms do not always wait for your forties and fifties. For some women, the first signs begin sooner and build slowly, reshaping daily life in ways that are easy to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peer-reviewed study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Fulltext/2020/07000/Early_ovarian_aging_and_symptoms_in_women_under.6.aspx" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;journal Menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that nearly 28 percent of women aged 25 to 35 reported symptoms linked to early ovarian function changes. Researchers noted that early hormonal fluctuations can be mild yet persistent, which is why they often escape attention until patterns become harder to ignore. This does not mean full menopause is beginning, but it highlights how sensitive the body is to early changes in ovarian activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Menopause: Beyond the cliches - Dr. Nandita Palshetkar uncovers subtle symptoms and how women must self-care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms and the early hormonal triggers behind them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones rarely move in a predictable pattern. They rise and fall depending on genetics, stress, lifestyle, sleep quality and natural variations in ovarian reserve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these changes become irregular, hidden menopause symptoms start to appear. These may include irritability, low mood, headaches, unexpected tiredness, breast tenderness or changes in body temperature. Because these experiences can look like everyday stress, many women overlook the hormonal link. Yet even small shifts in oestrogen can influence energy levels, appetite, mood and thermoregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms and subtle cognitive changes in young women&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most surprising early signals is cognitive slowing. Many women under 30 report difficulty concentrating or recalling information that once came easily. You may find yourself rereading messages, losing track of small tasks or feeling mentally cluttered by midday. Research has shown that oestrogen supports areas of the brain responsible for memory and focus. When levels fluctuate, cognitive function becomes less steady, and the brain works harder to maintain clarity. This leads to a subtle, gradual fog that disrupts daily flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms and sleep disturbances that creep in early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disruption is another early and often misunderstood symptom. You may fall asleep easily but wake repeatedly, feel warmer at night or struggle to return to sleep after early morning waking. These disturbances can build over weeks and affect your energy, mood and productivity. Oestrogen plays a major role in regulating core temperature and sleep cycles. When hormone levels dip, your body becomes more sensitive to light, temperature and stress, all of which interfere with deep rest. Over time, even mild sleep fragmentation can reshape how alert or calm you feel during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms linked to mood, anxiety and emotional balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional shifts often appear early and subtly. You may feel unusually sensitive, anxious or overwhelmed by situations that never bothered you before. This is not a sign of weakness. It is a physiological response to changing hormone activity. Studies consistently show that mood symptoms begin earlier in the hormonal transition than most women expect. Changes in oestrogen can influence serotonin, which stabilises mood, appetite and emotional reactions. When this balance is affected, emotional responses may become amplified, unpredictable or harder to regulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms affecting physical comfort and daily routines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical changes may also surface long before 30 but remain unrecognised. These include changes in skin hydration, increased bloating, irregular cravings, vaginal dryness, reduced lubrication, bladder urgency or mild joint discomfort. These shifts do not always appear together. Instead, they show up gradually, making them easier to dismiss as isolated issues. When observed collectively, they suggest the early influence of hormonal fluctuations. Even with regular menstrual cycles, the deeper hormonal patterns may be shifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to do if hidden menopause symptoms are affecting you before 30&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these symptoms feel familiar, the first step is awareness rather than panic. Track your cycle, sleep, mood and physical changes for at least two months. Patterns provide clarity and help your doctor understand what is happening. Medical guidance is essential because early symptoms can overlap with thyroid conditions, nutritional deficiencies or stress responses. Alongside professional advice, lifestyle habits can support hormonal balance. Strength training, balanced meals, omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin D and a consistent sleep routine can help. Limiting caffeine after midday and managing stress through breathwork or gentle exercise can also reduce symptom intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden menopause symptoms can begin earlier than expected, but early awareness gives you more control. Understanding how your body responds to hormonal shifts helps you make informed choices about health, lifestyle and medical care. If you are noticing subtle changes, it is worth paying attention rather than dismissing them. Knowledge is the first step to feeling better and staying ahead of what your body is trying to tell you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
