That accounted for about 95 percent of Hickman Farms' bird population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CEO Glenn Hickman held a press conference on May 30 to address the situation. To him, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14530151/government-high-alert-bird-flu-warning-death-sheep.html"&gt;the loss was entirely preventable&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If our pullets had been vaccinated when we started lobbying the federal government in January, our pullets would have been saved by now,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman and Hickman Family farms have been advocating for access to avian &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-8f4ed850-417a-11f0-bc8b-09207515360b"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccines since January.&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hickmanseggs.com/notification/"&gt; According to the company's website&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses the situation, the U.S. government makes a vaccine, but only uses it as an export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'European countries have now been vaccinating their flocks for a couple of years and are gaining the upper hand on controlling this disease. That vaccine is actually made here in the U.S., but we export to other countries while our flocks go unprotected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The site encourages customers to contact their representatives in a continued push for access to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CEO Glenn Hickman said that the tragic loss of millions of his chickens was preventable &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Hickman's Family Farms plant, one of the biggest egg producers in the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'The quicker we can start vaccinating our nation's poultry flock, the quicker we can get back to normalized operations,' said Hickman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman Farms is just the largest of several that have been affected in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On June 2, the Arizona Department of Agriculture confirmed that another farm in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area was placed under quarantine. The farm still remains unnamed, but per their press release, poultry began showing symptoms on May and tested positive on May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman farms took similar measures to prevent spread, but now is focused on repopulating their farm. According to Hickman, the process of de-populating, cleaning and re-populating will take almost two years. They process will begin in just a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the mean time, Hickman Farms has stopped operations. Hundreds of their 850 employees are out of the job - many of whom are contract workers and inmates. Fortunately, some employees will still be needed during the cleaning process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Customers of Hickman farms and other affected farms in Arizona do not need to be worried about &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14658491/Symptoms-bird-flu-pandemic-america-warning.html"&gt;contracting bird flu through consumption&lt;/a&gt;. The AZDA wrote in a press release on May 20 that eggs from chickens who tested positive have not entered food supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There have been no signs of illness in humans,' they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Consumers in Arizona and around the nation can remain confident in the safety and quality of eggs and egg products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Chickens inside Hickman's Family Farms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to CDC numbers, only 70 human cases of bird flu have been reported in the past 14 months, including one death. The AZDA and the CDC said that humans at highest risk are those who have worked directly with affected poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the outbreak, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.azfamily.com/2025/05/30/hickmans-family-farms-loses-95-arizona-chickens-bird-flu/"&gt;Arizona's Family &lt;/a&gt;reports that for the first time in 81  Hickman Farms will be unable to satisfy all of their customer demand. The company is looking for alternative ways to meet their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone is upset about the decline in operations. 12 News reports that nearby residents are happy to be rid of the stench that comes with operating a chicken farm. &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/hickmans-family-farms-sued-in-federal-court"&gt;According to Fox 10&lt;/a&gt;, locals and environmental activists sued Hickman Farms in 2018 for polluting the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily Mail reached out to Hickman Family Farms and the Arizona Department of Agriculture for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"However, if you see one in the daylight, or if it's in a place where you or your pet can pick it up, there's a good chance it is ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's positive test is the Beehive State's first report of a rabies-positive bat in 2025. Carter added that as the weather warms, the chances for coming across a rabid animal increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a virus that impacts the brain and nervous system of infected animals and can be fatal if not treated properly and promptly — which includes pre-exposure vaccination for pets and post-exposure vaccinations for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, rabies spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through bites, scratches or direct contact with mucosa (eyes, mouth, or open wounds). Feces, blood and urine do not transmit rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Utah, bats are the most common carriers of the rabies virus. Skunks, raccoons, foxes and unvaccinated cats and dogs can also carry the disease, but Utah law requires cats and dogs to be vaccinated for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weber-Morgan Health Department provided the following tips when it comes to rabies prevention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pet's vaccinations up to date. Check the pet's vaccination status with your veterinarian and put your records where you can access them quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from wild animals. Call your local animal control for assistance if it appears sick, injured or is acting strangely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act quickly if you are bitten or scratched by a bat or other wild animal. Immediately wash the wound with soap and water and see your health care provider. If possible, safely contain the bat and contact the Utah Division of Wildlife Services so it can be tested for rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any interactions with a bat found in a sleeping area. Any exposure to a bat in a sleeping area is considered an exposure due to their ability to spread the virus through extremely small bites or scratches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is important because it is how we prevent rabies in our cats and dogs. It saves time and heartache if your pet is involved in a biting incident or comes in contact with a rabid bat or other animal," Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Oct. 2024, a bat in Pioneer Park &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51147132" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;tested positive for rabies&lt;/a&gt;, and Salt Lake County health officials said it was handled "potentially for an extended period," likely by multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about bats, animals and rabies can be found &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/rabies/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study has found a startling link between chronic cannabis use and increased risk of cardiovascular disease—regardless of whether you smoke it or consume edibles. The finding challenges commonly held beliefs about the health impacts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which many see as a relatively harmless drug—especially when ingested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study, published Wednesday, May 28 in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2834540?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2025.1399"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, found that THC smokers suffer from significantly worse artery function than non-users. They observed the same effect in edible consumers, though their arteries were not as severely affected. In either case, vascular function was reduced by roughly half compared to those who do not use cannabis, according to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/05/430051/whether-its-smoking-or-edibles-marijuana-bad-your-heart"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Scientifically, this THC result is really interesting but boy does it screw up the public health messaging,’” co-author Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at UCSF, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cannabis/article/ucsf-cannabis-heart-health-risks-20349621.php"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reportedly said to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lead author and UCSF physician-scientist Leila Mohammadi when he saw the data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These results add to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cannabis-use-marijuana-surgery-anesthesia-study-1849966607"&gt;&lt;span&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that suggests long-term weed use can lead to cardiovascular damage and life-threatening events such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/synthetic-weed-may-cause-heart-attacks-but-its-tough-t-5926944"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart attacks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and strokes, though experts still lack consensus on its precise impacts. A 2024 study published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030178"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that people who consume cannabis daily had a 25% increased risk of heart attack and a 42% increased risk of stroke compared to non-users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For this new study, researchers investigated how cannabis impacts vascular function. To isolate the effects of chronic cannabis use, they recruited 55 otherwise healthy adults aged 18 to 50 who did not use any form of nicotine and were not frequently exposed to secondhand smoke. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These participants were sorted into three groups: marijuana smokers, edible users, and non-users. Those in the two cannabis user groups reported taking the drug at least three times per week, either exclusively through smoking or edibles.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To assess the participants’ vascular function, the researchers measured dilation of the brachial artery—located in the upper arm—to determine whether it could properly expand in response to increased blood flow. To that end, they used an inflatable forearm cuff to briefly block blood flow to the artery, then used ultrasound to measure its diameter before and after inflating the cuff. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at UCSF whose lab led the study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/marijuana/weed-may-be-bad-for-your-heart-whether-you-smoke-or-consume-edibles"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Live Science that his test offers a “window into the future.” When blood vessels cannot fully dilate, he said, the risk of heart attack and other poor cardiovascular outcomes increases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants who did not consume cannabis showed an average vessel dilation—represented as the percent change from the baseline measurement of artery diameter—of 10.4%. This value was significantly reduced among weed smokers and edible users, who showed an average vessel dilation of 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively. For reference, average values for brachial artery dilation in healthy individuals typically &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4324696/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from 8.0% to 15%. In a previous study, Springer’s lab &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317749"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; similarly reduced levels of vessel dilation among e-cigarette and cigarette smokers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To better understand how THC causes this change, the researchers ran lab tests to determine how endothelial cells—which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26848/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the linings of blood vessels and release nitric oxide to trigger dilation—responded to the participants’ blood samples. These tests revealed that the blood of chronic cannabis smokers inhibited nitric oxide production in the cells, which may explain why these participants showed reduced vessel dilation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This effect was not observed in edible consumers, however, suggesting that ingestible THC may impact arterial function via an entirely separate mechanism. Figuring out what that mechanism may be will require further research. What’s more, subsequent studies will need to reproduce these findings in a larger population to validate the results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within the last several years, cannabis use among U.S. adults has reached new heights, according to the NIH’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2024/08/cannabis-and-hallucinogen-use-among-adults-remained-at-historic-highs-in-2023"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As such, investigating the health effects of THC is more important than ever before—especially as mounting evidence challenges perceptions of weed as a harmless high. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Although our sex is determined at the moment the sperm fertilizes the egg, it is not until a month and a half later that the biological programming to develop testes or ovaries is activated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Textbooks have always taught that this process is 100% dictated by genetics: males have one female and &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-23/the-male-sex-chromosome-the-last-unexplored-territory-of-human-dna-has-been-conquered.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-23/the-male-sex-chromosome-the-last-unexplored-territory-of-human-dna-has-been-conquered.html"&gt;one male chromosome&lt;/a&gt;, XY, and females have &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-02-02/scientists-identify-one-reason-women-suffer-more-from-autoimmune-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-02-02/scientists-identify-one-reason-women-suffer-more-from-autoimmune-diseases.html"&gt;two female chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;, XX. But on Wednesday, the results of a bold experiment with mice were published, showing that very low iron levels in the mother can transform males into females, regardless of their genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an environmental factor can influence sex determination in a mammal,” &lt;a href="https://www.fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research_group/detail/6" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research_group/detail/6"&gt;Makoto Tachibana&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at Osaka University in Japan and leader of the research, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09063-2" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09063-2"&gt;journal &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells EL PAÍS. “The most important implication of this finding,” he adds, “is that environmental and metabolic conditions influence fundamental developmental decisions that until now were thought to be strictly determined by genetics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Almost four decades ago, the study of people born with ovaries despite being genetically male (XY), and vice versa — a rare genetic disorder — led to the discovery of the &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2022-07-08/gender-identity-is-not-something-that-you-choose-as-evidenced-by-the-failure-of-conversion-therapies.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/society/2022-07-08/gender-identity-is-not-something-that-you-choose-as-evidenced-by-the-failure-of-conversion-therapies.html"&gt;SRY gene&lt;/a&gt;. This genetic fragment within the male Y chromosome is the main factor responsible for sexual differentiation in mammals. If the gene is present, the gonads begin to form testes at six weeks of development; if not, they inevitably become ovaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This process also initiates the production of sex hormones and the activation of other genes that produce more physical traits characteristic of each sex. All this happens in the highly protected environment of the uterus, safe from environmental interference. Mammals are unusual in this respect, since many animals determine their sex based on temperature, social hierarchy, size, or parasites infecting the mother, as occurs in some&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-11-14/animals-that-change-sex-how-and-why-do-they-do-it.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-11-14/animals-that-change-sex-how-and-why-do-they-do-it.html"&gt; reptiles, fish, and insects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The researchers discovered that if iron concentration is reduced by 60% at the cellular level, the testicular gene is switched off. When they reproduced this iron deficiency in pregnant female mice carrying males, they observed that six out of 39 XY offspring were born with two ovaries, a complete sex reversal. Another mouse was born intersex, with one ovary and one testicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The same happened in another set of experiments, where they studied the morphology of embryos from mothers treated with a drug that sequesters iron from the body: five out of 72 males developed female sexual organs. Although these numbers of sex reversal might seem small, it is an undeniable effect on a fundamental developmental mechanism previously thought to be shielded from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The study details how an external factor ends up influencing the fetus’s genetics. It is through epigenetics, a collection of chemical marks sensitive to environmental factors located on the genome that modify its functioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Extremely low iron affects the enzyme KDM3A, which modifies a chemical change that turns off the testis-producing gene SRY right at the moment of sex determination. The result is genetically male mice with two ovaries that lived apparently healthy up to eight weeks, although it has not been studied whether they could reproduce — in humans, sex reversal usually leads to infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Iron deficiency in the body, which can cause anemia, is a health risk for both the mother and the baby. This deficiency is usually not severe and can be corrected on its own or by eating iron-rich foods such as cockles. However, in more severe cases, it must be treated, as it can increase the risk of miscarriage, perinatal mortality, and susceptibility to infections in the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w _pr lb_btn"&gt;&lt;img alt="Makoto Tachibana" decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" class="icon_multimedia_ampliar | _pa a_m_i a_m_i-a _dn" viewbox="0 0 40 40"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Makoto Tachibana, center back row, with the rest of his team from Osaka University in Japan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;M. T.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“At this point, we don’t know if a similar process could occur in humans,” says Tachibana. While he believes it would be difficult to find such low iron levels in nature, he argues “it’s a very important question that deserves to be investigated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ugr.es/personal/francisco-javier-barrionuevo-jimenez" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ugr.es/personal/francisco-javier-barrionuevo-jimenez"&gt;Francisco Javier Barrionuevo&lt;/a&gt;, professor of genetics at the University of Granada in Spain, who did not participate in the study, highlights its importance. “Discovering that something as mundane as iron concentration can cause a mammalian embryo to develop as a female is spectacular,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;His team is investigating several biological components that can interfere in this process, including one they discovered very recently: tiny RNA sequences with no apparent function that are nevertheless capable of causing a complete sex reversal. In this case, the biologist warns, it is even more surprising because it is an external element not linked to the genetic code. Barrionuevo returns to the question raised by his Japanese colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Something like this has never been described in humans, as the study itself explains, but I think it could have happened in cases of extreme malnutrition and simply gone undetected,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01456-7" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01456-7"&gt;op-ed published alongside the study&lt;/a&gt;, cellular biologists Shannon Dupont and Blanche Capel, from Duke University in the United States, celebrate the “impressive series of experiments.” This study “provides clear evidence that variations in metabolism in the controlled uterine environment interface with the genetic sex-determination cascade and affect testis development,” state the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Chapel and Dupont note that iron deficiency is a known factor that can affect the health of both the mother and the baby, potentially impacting their neurological development. Following this line of thought, they wonder what other more subtle effects this deficiency might have, which opens up the possibility that the mother’s diet could affect not only the formation of testes but also other traits of “masculinity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:39:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>美国近4个月没有出现新的人类禽流感确诊病例—为什么？ -雅虎 | The U.S. hasn’t seen a new confirmed human bird flu case in nearly 4 months — why? - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQNzVKY2xRZWk4V1BvdFEtbDU3RUlsc3c1d1V6QTNxOFkySTRYNGstaU1GQjV6YWhMM1ZQdVRURjNWRnlIQmk0WTRkdDNRVGpDbUY4N2d5SEhVYUFQOVM4eUp5QmhCXzR2MnAtQ0VQNEF6cWZJY05aRTBxQVJSZVRMZW1fQy1QUGR5WE5kdzRPOUhRQ21ocXVLanV3RjZHdE9ZOFJtWGhwMElkSVpyU19kbXZORUJKejZiSWM0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Soaring egg prices and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/bird-flu-faq-is-my-pet-safe-can-i-eat-runny-eggs-is-it-safe-to-go-to-the-park-220806548.html" data-ylk="slk:concerns about bird flu;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;concerns about bird flu&lt;/a&gt; spreading from wild birds and cattle to humans were top of mind for many Americans at the beginning of 2025.

No cases have been reported in the state since. The Associated Press has reported, citing state records, that testing efforts have &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-hasnt-seen-human-bird-175352305.html" data-ylk="slk:“fallen off;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;“fallen off&lt;/a&gt;.” During 2024 at least 50 people were tested per month, compared with three people tested in March, one in April and none in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In recent weeks, the overall number of new animal H5N1 virus infections reported by [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] has declined, reducing the number of people exposed to infected animals, and human cases have declined as well,” a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While there’s the possibility that the H5N1 virus is waning in the U.S. for the time being, experts are worried that the efforts to monitor bird flu infections is the factor that’s actually waning. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, is worried because while these latest cases have been &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/top-doctors-warn-bird-flu-180403844.html" data-ylk="slk:relatively mild;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;relatively mild&lt;/a&gt;, the virus has been “quite deadly,” &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22401-bird-flu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:historically speaking;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;historically speaking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Of the known human cases that have been identified, about half of them have died, Nuzzo told Yahoo News, “and that is a truly staggering percentage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yahoo News spoke to Nuzzo and Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director at the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, in an effort to gain some insight as to why those CDC case numbers haven’t budged in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-havent-we-seen-an-increase-in-human-bird-flu-infections-since-february"&gt;Why haven’t we seen an increase in human bird flu infections since February?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The short answer is, we don’t know,” Nuzzo said. But experts like her have offered some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Migratory bird patterns have changed: &lt;/strong&gt;Wild birds are primary spreaders of avian flu. The United States could be experiencing a natural and temporary decline in human cases, which tend to peak in the fall and early winter, possibly because migration patterns have seasonally changed as well, a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-hasnt-seen-human-bird-175352305.html" data-ylk="slk:CDC official;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;CDC official&lt;/a&gt; noted during a May call with U.S. doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As we expect to see bird migration patterns rev back up here in the next few months, I suspect we're going to see increased levels of H5N1 in migratory birds,” Hopkins said. “That's probably going to result in more poultry flocks and more other animals infected. I think that again raises our risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. It’s possible that less of the virus is circulating: &lt;/strong&gt;Humans can become infected with bird flu through exposure to sick wild birds, poultry, backyard flocks or cattle. Avian flu infections are still being detected in birds and cattle but not as frequently as they were several months ago. “Since February 2025, there have been fewer affected dairy herds and commercial poultry flocks in the United States, and we believe, fewer workers are being exposed to sick animals,” a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Testing at the state and local levels for H5N1 has decreased:&lt;/strong&gt; Nuzzo suggested that perhaps there has been an overall reduction in human testing for H5N1, rather than a decrease in viral spread. “One of the concerns that I have is that states have appeared to be conducting just less general testing for H5N1,” Nuzzo said. “Those things coupled with a general lack of any communication from federal agencies about H5N1 leaves us very concerned that what we might be seeing is just a contraction of surveillance and not necessarily an abatement of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News that the agency’s “guidance and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/h5-monitoring/index.html__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!E4kaX89TX2EXsGuaieeDHQOm01gjhgmJHZikqAM4Mx_eZlAl7vHaw4hmbgWj_sXdV-oD7Se9VREdxNcv$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:surveillance efforts;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; for human cases of H5N1 virus infections have not changed. State and local health departments continue to monitor for illness in persons exposed to sick animals. However, no new human cases of H5N1 virus infections have been identified and reported to CDC in recent months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Less prevalence in wastewater surveillance: &lt;/strong&gt;People who contract bird flu can shed pieces of the virus through wastewater, like from handwashing, bathing or laundering clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But as the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC website;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC website&lt;/a&gt; notes, “Wastewater data cannot determine the source of influenza A viruses.” Nuzzo agrees that wastewater surveillance alone isn’t the best method in determining whether human bird flu infections are waning but “probably the best thing we have in terms of figuring out how much virologic activity is occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hopkins says the presence of H5N1 showing up in wastewater surveillance has slowed. “So less virus means less transmission,” Hopkins said. “They are positive factors for right now, and they don't mean that we won't have greater problems going forward,” he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the week ending May 24, out of 340 sites nationwide as part of the CDC’s National Wastewater Surveillance System, there were 17 sites, in New Jersey and Oregon, that reported any detection of H5N1, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The current virus strain isn’t good at infecting humans: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/inhumans.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC has confirmed;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; instances of bird flu that have passed from birds to animals, from birds to humans and from animals to humans. What about human to human?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It appears that this H5 virus has not developed the mutations necessary to easily transmit to humans and to easily transmit from person to person because we don't have any confirmed person-to-person spread either,” Hopkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="experts-worry-federal-government-cuts-could-decrease-bird-flu-monitoring-in-humans"&gt;Experts worry federal government cuts could decrease bird flu monitoring in humans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That’s my deep fear,” Nuzzo said. “I do know there have been concerns about attention on [bird flu] from the agricultural sector, in part due to USDA cuts and letting go of the staff who worked on H5N1.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal workforce, more than 15,000 USDA employees have taken one of two financial incentives to leave the agency. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-hasnt-seen-human-bird-175352305.html" data-ylk="slk:Three of 14 experts;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Three of 14 experts&lt;/a&gt; responding to disease outbreaks at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network are among the staff that have accepted the offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nuzzo said even before the cuts, experts like herself were concerned that states weren’t being aggressive enough in responding to H5N1 either because they didn’t think it was a problem or because it was on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In 2024, federal agencies regularly held briefings on the topic with both outside experts like myself, but also state and local health officials,” Nuzzo said. “I think absent that, it's just hard to know what is going on, and it's hard to not assume that things aren't going on. It also makes it hard to say, one way or another, how much of an issue [bird flu] is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="should-the-general-public-be-concerned-about-bird-flu-right-now"&gt;Should the general public be concerned about bird flu right now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC says;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt; the current risk to the general public is low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Right at this moment, Nuzzo said, the general public shouldn’t be worried about bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The people that I'm worried about are people who are being exposed to infected animals,” Nuzzo said, “and that's largely people in the agricultural sector, the farm workers who have disincentives for coming forward if they become infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Immigration labor accounts for 51% of all dairy labor, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.nmpf.org/issues/labor-rural-policy/labor-and-immigration-reform-efforts/#:~:text=Immigrant%20labor%20accounts%20for%2051,economy%20more%20than%20$32%20billion." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Milk Producers Federation;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Milk Producers Federation&lt;/a&gt;.

I’d accidentally fallen asleep with it inside me, and the ball had hit the porcelain bowl.&lt;em&gt; Uh-oh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;contentType&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Article&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sectionId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;wellness&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;tags&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;wellness/wellness&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Well actually&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Life and style&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;campaign/email/well-actually&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Campaign&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Health &amp;amp; wellbeing&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;lifeandstyle/women&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Women&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;society/womens-health&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Keyword&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Women's health&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;type/article&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Type&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Article&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;tone/features&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Tone&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Features&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Tracking&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;US lifestyle and wellness&amp;quot;}],&amp;quot;isPaidContent&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;isPreview&amp;quot;:false,&amp;quot;host&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;pageId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;wellness/2025/jun/04/fixed-incontinence-bladder-kegels-perimenopause&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://profile.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;contributionsServiceUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://contributions.guardianapis.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;editionId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;US&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I dismounted and stuck my ungloved hand deep into the toilet. Luckily, I was able to retrieve it before it entered the drain pipe, preventing the need for a mortifying 3am call to my super. This was both my first and last time using the Kegel ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eighteen years prior, I had experienced bladder leakage after giving birth, but it resolved within a year. Once perimenopause hit at age 47, however, the condition returned and managing it had become my part-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the advice of my gynecologist, I’d tried daily self-directed Kegel exercises, tampon-like devices designed to prevent leaks by lifting the urethra and bladder training – or gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits, which I lost interest in pretty quickly. None of these options really worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So my bladder kept leaking, usually after laughing, coughing or sneezing. Panty liners were now an essential part of my wardrobe. The worst leaks occurred when I went on a run, and required more substantial protection. I wondered how many other middle-aged women on my Central Park loop had diaper-like devices hidden under their Lululemon leggings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="02fee265-62a4-48ac-ab78-b0d5703d6ea2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Perimenopause has brought chaos to my life – but also peace","elementId":"02fee265-62a4-48ac-ab78-b0d5703d6ea2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/mar/27/perimenopause-life-changes"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Probably a lot. More than 60% of US women surveyed from 2015 to 2018 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35030139/#full-view-affiliation-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported bladder control challenges&lt;/a&gt;. Incontinence often begins after childbirth, due to a combination of estrogen loss and physical trauma, says Dr Meghan Markowski, board certified clinical specialist in women’s health physical therapy at Brigham and Women’s hospital. “Because we have a certain reserve of estrogen, things get better. Then, when we start to lose estrogen in peri- and post-menopause, these symptoms come back with full-fledged vengeance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I was an empty nester, recent divorcee and dating again for the first time in decades when incontinence rereared its ugly head. On dates, I’d often scurry away in order to beat the leak. I wondered what these men thought of all those visits to the bathroom – perhaps they suspected I was sneaking drugs or plotting my escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although males are also likely to lose some bladder control with age, middle-aged men &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1016/j.juro.2010.05.025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;do not experience&lt;/a&gt; the same surge in incontinence that women do. The men I met were mostly my age and their kids had probably been potty trained a decade ago, or more. Did they really want a partner who was going through the reverse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you can’t beat it, talk about it, I decided. And as I started to share, I noticed two things. First, men are usually OK with discussing your vaginal region, no matter the reason. And second, when I revealed my problem to female friends, I learned that I was in good company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s no reason why this should be taboo,” said &lt;a href="https://doctors.nyp.org/larissa-rodriguez-md/525-east-68th-street" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Larissa Rodríguez&lt;/a&gt;, urologist-in-chief and director of the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/weillcornell.org/center-for-female-pelvic-health__;!!Aut6IJkzM0Y!pi8yYMfSggU_yQ29kriQoMu96GG0JbZ1OQgqOAzttFQmdGSj8n3VNaIzvEKEmPyrGDXPX0I3aROFiqoGygRlmdoVgrY$" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Center for Female Pelvic Health&lt;/a&gt; at NewYork-Presbyterian hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine. “For anything that affects women’s quality of life, they should seek care because there are ways to treat it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-causes-incontinence-in-women" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes incontinence in women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are two main types of incontinence: stress and urge. Both occur because of a decline in estrogen, which weakens the pelvic floor and thins the lining of the urethra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress incontinence is caused by physical pressure – such as coughing or running – putting stress on the bladder, leading to urine leakage. This is common when the pelvic muscles, which support the urethra, are weak. This is the type I had: unpleasant and inconvenient, but manageable with pads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Urge incontinence occurs when the bladder contracts more than it should, and can be much harder to live with. “It’s characterized by the sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is either difficult or impossible to defer,” said Markowski. “You could be out shopping, everything’s great, and you go to check out and all of a sudden … &lt;em&gt;Clear the path! I have to get there immediately!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-treat-incontinence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to treat incontinence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For stress incontinence, the gold standard is sling surgery,” said Rodríguez. The sling is “material put under the urethra, like a hammock, so the urethra has something to close against when there’s an increase in abdominal pressure”. Traditionally, mesh is used but it’s also possible for doctors to harvest tissue from the patient, like the lining of the abdomen or the fascia of the thigh muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alternatively, stress incontinence can be relieved by injecting bulking agents to increase resistance and thickness in the urethral wall. “These are similar to the fillers people use for wrinkles,” said Rodríguez. “They are mostly water-based and close the urethra up a bit.” This is a good option for those who want to avoid surgery. It’s a shorter-term fix, but can last several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Urge incontinence can be improved with two types of medication, both of which reduce bladder contractions. The first type, anticholinergics, accomplish this by blocking the chemical messenger acetylcholine, while the second type, beta-3 agonists, relax the bladder’s detrusor muscle, thereby increasing bladder capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If medication fails, Rodríguez said nerve modulation – changing nerve activity via stimulation – is the next step. Inserting a pacemaker near the sacral nerves, which manage the bladder, can result in improved brain-to-bladder communication and control. Acupuncture can stimulate nerves at the ankle, blocking abnormal signals from the bladder and preventing spasms. Another option is injecting botulinum toxin, the same one people &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/14/qa-why-are-more-people-using-botox-and-what-are-the-risks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;use for cosmetic purposes&lt;/a&gt;. It relaxes the bladder muscles so you don’t have spasms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress and urge incontinence are both caused by midlife estrogen decline, so ongoing vaginal estrogen supplementation may help, like what’s prescribed for vaginal dryness at menopause, according to Dr Rajita Patil, assistant clinical professor of OB-GYN at UCLA and director of UCLA Health’s comprehensive menopause care program. “It takes a few months to see a difference, and the risks are really low,” said Patil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-22" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are the muscles so weak you can’t activate them? Or are they so tense you can’t activate them? The starting function of the pelvic floor muscles will determine the plan of care,” Markowski said. But a training program takes time; Markowski recommends at least three months. If this seems daunting, she suggests at least one pelvic physical therapy session to be properly evaluated and advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No matter which treatment you choose, behavior modification is also essential. “Alcohol, caffeine, carbonated beverages and artificial sweeteners irritate the bladder,” said Patil, who also encourages adequate hydration and maintaining a “healthy” body weight. “The more fat there is on the bladder and the urethral sphincter, the greater the pressure exerted on these structures, weakening their ability to maintain closure and increasing the likelihood of urinary leakage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another behavioral strategy is bladder retraining – gradually increasing the time intervals between bathroom visits, improving your ability to hold urine – which my gynecologist had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-sling-surgery-fixed-my-incontinence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How sling surgery fixed my incontinence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A friend mentioned someone who had undergone a sling surgery, which I’d never heard of. It seemed like a great option, and I could hardly contain my excitement. A week after turning 50, I made an appointment with a urogynecologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="77a5daef-d2db-474c-8ce8-14a582ca7eac" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":29,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Prolapse, tearing, pain: a urogynecologist on what you should know before giving birth","elementId":"77a5daef-d2db-474c-8ce8-14a582ca7eac","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/10/urogynecologist-childbirth-interview"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I’m tired of peeing in my pants,” were my exact words. “Please fix me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A bladder test determined that I had stress incontinence. I scheduled the surgery, an outpatient procedure covered by insurance. Recovery was virtually painless; I didn’t even take any Tylenol. I stayed home for a few days, and was told not to exercise or “stick anything in the vagina” for four weeks. The hardest part was not being able to work out, but the anticipation of pad-less runs made it worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, two months post-surgery, my runs are pee-free. Last week, I visited my surgeon to reperform the bladder test. She made my bladder uncomfortably full via a catheter, then asked me to make a small cough. Then a medium cough. Then a loud one. My underpants remained as dry as a bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to my surgeon, I should be “fixed” for at least the next 10 years. And physical therapy, though not mandatory, could make the results last longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, there is no such thing as a perfect solution, and treatments may work best when combined with others. Markowski, who’s dedicated over 20 years to helping patients non-surgically, acknowledges that physical therapy might not be enough to resolve symptoms in all cases: “We always want to start with the most conservative measures and up the ante as time goes on, with meds or surgery. But surgery doesn’t change the muscle function, so in many cases, even the surgeon will want their patient to undergo physical therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rodríguez, a surgeon, concurs: “I am a strong believer in physical therapy, and pilates is also quite good in getting people to engage the pelvic floor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The best thing I ever did about my incontinence was start talking about it. Chances are, if you share, you’ll learn that you’re not alone. If you’re really lucky, you’ll even find someone to laugh with you about it. And if you pee a little when you do, you won’t be the only one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQcUx6UlZ2cXRPeEFVYzV5WmVNRVo4UEdPRHZXX0NhOUp6ZjMyZ3hUR1VzTm1tY29JR19xdl9zMDZqSDRGZkVsZ1VzdHFFVlV4NkZTSlItSVRHZjRacVVhbXNsRjNOanp0QUxBeXNUbnZhNDc5M2pYYXpwLTB1QmdodE9pc2ttNE1EYi10b1h0eFhiNi1jZHQ2X0Y2UzM</guid></item><item><title>纽约新型冠状病毒：有关症状、病例、疫苗的信息- Syracuse.com | New Covid variant in NY: What to know about symptoms, cases, vaccines - Syracuse.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7PQYTRSPUBF7VKSATO7ZJTJ6ZM"&gt;A new Covid variant has spread to the U.S., including in New York state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AAJ33JG6JFGFFLCXCF2467XJWA"&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that NB.1.8.1, a new mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that sparked the coronavirus pandemic beginning in late 2019, has been detected in people arriving at airports in the United States.

She is now a strong advocate for treatments for the disease and for spreading awareness of the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This means more than to 44million more adults under 45 years old could be eligible for screening if this was adopted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), which sets colon cancer screening guidelines, has already lowered the recommended age for screening from 50 to 45 years in May 2021, saying this would have a 'moderate' benefit for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data shows about 34.5 percent of 45- to 49-year-olds got screened for colon cancer in 2022, a study found, up from 19.7 percent in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US already has a lower colon cancer screening age than some other Western nations, including Canada — where it is set at 50 years — and England — which lowered the age from 60 to 50 years in 2021.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say people with symptoms of colon cancer or those who are concerned about the disease and are under 45 years old may still be able to get screened on their health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insurance would consider screening tests for this group as diagnostic screenings&lt;span&gt; - a test to investigate specific symptoms - rather than a preventative screening - a test done on someone without symptoms to catch a disease early.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Out-of-pocket, a colonoscopy costs between $1,250 and $4,800 — although this varies significantly by state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Raphael revealed he and his wife both first got screened for colon cancer at 35, despite having no family history of the disease. He recommended anyone who is concerned do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Ontario-based physician, from the Sunnybrook Research Institute, added: 'Although I am from Canada, and the US has lower guidelines, I still think they should go further.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference in Chicago, Illinois, he gave a talk on how colon cancer rates were surging in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paulus said: 'We have seen an "algorithm" be used already for non-small cell lung cancer screening to determine who should be screened when, based on risk factors. The same could be useful for colon cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Obesity could be one of the factors used to determine risk, but it would be better to take a multifactorial approach including other factors such as family history or ethnicity/race, although that can be controversial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer at just 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common type of lung cancer, behind 85 out of every 100 cases diagnosed on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The USPSTF screening guidelines for lung cancer say adults aged 50 to 80 years get screened if they currently or within the last 15 years smoked 20 packs of cigarettes or more per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other doctors have also called for the screening age to be lowered, including Dr Aparna Parikh, a gastrointestinal cancer expert at Mass General Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She previously told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/07/should-colon-cancer-screening-start-at-40/"&gt;Harvard Gazette&lt;/a&gt;: 'As an oncologist who sees largely young patients, my bias is to screen earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many of my patients are in their 20s and 30s. Expanding the screening eligible age may be a good space for stool- and blood-based screening and risk stratification to get the right people to colonoscopies efficiently.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer is generally screened for using a colonoscopy, where a flexible tube is inserted through the anus and into the colon. Patients are told not to eat any solid food for at least 24 hours beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alternatives include stool-based testing, where the fecal matter is examined for specs of blood or changes in shape, or blood-based screenings, where the blood is tested for specific changes in DNA that may indicate the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the conference, Paulus presented her team's study that found half of colon cancer patients diagnosed before age 50 years are under 45 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her team analyzed data on 104,281 colon cancer patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2024, including 14,611 people who were diagnosed with the cancer before the age of 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also found that patients diagnosed with colon cancer before age 50 were more likely to be obese (36 percent of the group compared to 31 percent among older adults).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And more likely to live in urban areas, and be from a Black, American Indian or Hispanic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli (left) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last spring at 36 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Michael Raphael called for the colon cancer screening age to be lowered, while Jessica Paulus suggested that people with risk factors for the disease may need to be screened earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists concluded, 'In one of the largest cohorts of patients with EO-CRC [early-onset colorectal cancer] to date, this study confirmed that EO-CRC is an emerging concern within the US community oncology setting, particularly regarding heightened disparities in race, ethnicity, and lifestyle factors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pamela Kunz, the director of the Center for Gastrointestinal Cancers at Yale, Connecticut, told DailyMail.com in an interview that she did not believe the screening age for colon cancer should be lowered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At present, the best data we have suggests that starting screening from age 45 years has the greatest benefit,' she said, 'while those with a family history of the disease should start ten years younger than the age of diagnosis'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There has not been great uptake of colon cancer screenings among people aged 55 to 45 years after the age was lowered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's so much we don't know too about why individuals develop the cancer - and whether it's genetic, environmental, diet or another factor.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer cases &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14695689/colon-cancers-doctors-alarmed-rise-sharply-young-people.html"&gt;are surging &lt;/a&gt;among under-50s in the US in an uptick that has stunned researchers, with adults born in the 1980s having double the risk of suffering from the cancer compared to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among adults aged 25 to 29 years, colon cancer cancer rates have spiked 85 percent in two decades according to CDC data. AT the same time, over the last 30 years cases have dropped among over-50s by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Nutrient-packed foods can make a difference, and one fruit has been getting a lot of attention in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the researchers investigating this fruit’s benefits is &lt;a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/contact/mary-jane-de-souza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Mary Jane De Souza&lt;/a&gt; from Penn State. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work focuses on how it contributes to muscle mass and bone structure, especially in people over 45 who are facing the natural changes that come with menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscles-and-bones-need-extra-help"&gt;Muscles and bones need extra help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gradual loss of lean tissue can affect physical performance. Reduced bone density can also leave a person more prone to fractures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who want a balanced and enjoyable life after 45 often look for reliable dietary strategies that fit into a simple routine. Some studies have begun to explore how particular &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/black-gold-the-vitamin-packed-fruit-that-regulates-blood-sugar-and-blood-pressure/"&gt;fruits&lt;/a&gt; might fill that need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prunes contain a significant amount of nutrients, including vitamins and polyphenols. &lt;a href="https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/krnc/monthly-blog/what-are-polyphenols-another-great-reason-to-eat-fruits-and-veggies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; are chemical compounds linked with antioxidant properties that may support healthy cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have suggested that prunes might not only aid digestion but also help keep muscles and bones in decent shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-help-bones-and-muscles"&gt;Prunes help bones and muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion around prunes often highlights fiber, but that’s not the only draw. Experts have pointed out that prunes carry components that are important for muscle support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some references have also shown they can increase levels of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9526830/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IGF-1&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a role in normal bone development and muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a natural compound known as sorbitol, and certain acids that can influence blood sugar management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prunes appear to slow sugar absorption while helping the body handle glucose. Some studies connect these qualities to better energy balance throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-latest-research-found"&gt;What the latest research found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first randomized controlled trial to look at three-dimensional bone outcomes with respect to bone structure, geometry, and estimated strength,” said Dr. De Souza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Penn State&lt;/a&gt; tested how prunes affect bone structure in postmenopausal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-diet-improves-health-in-women-with-breast-cancer/"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt;. Their data suggests that a daily serving of prunes seems to slow typical bone changes seen in women after they stop having menstrual cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that investigation, people who ate at least four to six prunes per day saw noticeable stability in bone density measurements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that many participants who consumed prunes preserved bone quality over the course of a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-help-women-after-menopause"&gt;Prunes help women after menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women past 45, menopause means shifting hormone levels and a greater chance of bone mineral density loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38349471/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; revealed that routine prune intake kept certain bone markers stable in this group. One portion of research also highlighted how prunes help support cholesterol and antioxidant capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further data has shown that prunes are tied to a better gut environment. Some participants appeared to experience fewer changes associated with inflammation when adding prunes into their diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists theorize that healthy gut microbes and reduced inflammatory markers might have an important link to bone strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that not everyone responds to prunes the same way. In one study, women with more diverse &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4290017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt; were more likely to benefit from the fruit’s bone-supporting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-many-prunes-should-you-eat"&gt;How many prunes should you eat?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts encourage daily consumption of around 50 grams of prunes, which equals five or six pieces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This moderate serving size seems enough to deliver benefits without too many extra calories or sugars. People can easily add prunes to salads, cereals, or just enjoy them on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many individuals in research studies were also advised to take in enough calcium and vitamin D. That suggests a broader approach to diet and daily habits is still essential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, prunes have a particular identity as an easy snack that adds fiber, minerals, and certain vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants in the control group, who didn’t eat prunes, still improved their bone density. These women tended to have a higher &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/calculate-your-bmi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt; and more body fat overall, which may have played a role in protecting their bones through increased weight-bearing pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, higher BMI can also lead to health issues like &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, which were seen in these participants. The prune group, on the other hand, gained bone support without relying on excess weight or related metabolic risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prunes-bones-and-muscle-health"&gt;Prunes, bones, and muscle health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prunes are no substitute for medication or a doctor’s advice, some researchers see real potential in this fruit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also emphasize getting a healthy mix of exercise, which might help maintain lean mass and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organic-molecules-collagen-discovered-in-66-million-year-old-dinosaur-bones/"&gt;bone&lt;/a&gt; density as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued research points to a strong connection between natural compounds in prunes and measurable differences in skeletal support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More studies may clarify how prunes influence healthy gut bacteria or whether certain individuals benefit more than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1389638/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 15:13:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOZkh6c2FOVVMtbGJWWHNtaEVNVUxsZEZ5eWwwNXctVmtvU0huelJya0xjWGl6Tk4wTllyRmVUeENFRzRDb0VZSnJ3WEt0c1lTOVhFRGU5ZDZqdmVRcUlXUXl2bC1zN2tvVUZra0FVcWtrX0ROclg4elJ0emd0d0pHZEgxa2hZQVNsS1h1SHZGcEJmMkxpQy0yME0taDJhZkVPdDZxckFkVktvUQ</guid></item><item><title>6种已知可以立即降低血糖并最大限度降低糖尿病风险的最佳食物-印度时报 | 6 best foods that are known to instantly reduce blood sugar and minimise the risk of diabetes - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blood sugar levels go unnoticed, until they don’t.

          &lt;p&gt;A top expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was overseeing the process to update COVID-19 vaccine recommendations resigned on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resignation, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cdc-expert-resigns-covid-vaccines-advisory-role-sources-say-2025-06-03/"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed by &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-official-overseeing-covid-19-vaccine-recommendations-resigns/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, comes just a week after health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unilaterally &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-axes-covid-shot-guidance-for-pregnant-people-kids/"&gt;revoked and altered some of the CDC's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, restricting access to children and pregnant people. The resignation also comes three weeks before CDC's experts and advisors are scheduled to meet to publicly evaluate data and discuss the recommendations for this season—a long-established process that was disrupted by Kennedy's announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departing CDC official, Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a pediatric infectious disease expert, was a co-leader of a working group on COVID-19 vaccines who advised experts on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). She informed her ACIP colleagues of her resignation in an email on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role," Panagiotakopoulos wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unilateral changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the CDC and ACIP recommended COVID-19 vaccines for everyone ages 6 months and up. Experts have emphasized that pregnant people in particular should get vaccinated, as pregnancy suppresses the immune system and puts pregnant people at high risk of severe COVID-19 and death. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that "COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic." Further, &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/4/e014247"&gt;dozens of studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccines are safe and effective at protecting the pregnant person, the pregnancy, and newborns.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the link between dietary and blood cholesterol levels isn’t as clear as once believed. In fact, some dairy products are incredibly beneficial for heart health—including unflavored, low-fat milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Research shows that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7918189/healthiest-milks-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dairy products, like milk&lt;/a&gt;, can fit into a heart-healthy diet,” says &lt;a href="https://www.laurentwiggenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lauren Twigge MCN, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;, adding, “While milk does contain some saturated fat, it also contains B-vitamins, potassium, calcium and magnesium which are known to support heart health.” 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here, we explain how consuming foods (and beverages) containing cholesterol might affect heart health and why low-fat milk is the #1 dairy product to enjoy if you’re trying to improve your cholesterol levels.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In recent years, researchers have found that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/do-you-need-to-limit-dietary-cholesterol-11734823" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol in food&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t always have a negative impact on your blood cholesterol, as was previously thought.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “In fact, registered dietitians like myself now better understand that total saturated fat intake, not cholesterol, is actually the dietary component that has the largest impact on your cholesterol levels,” explains Twigge. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High saturated fat intake has been shown to increase &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/hdl-vs-ldl-cholesterol-whats-the-difference-11678853" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;LDL&lt;/a&gt; (“bad”) cholesterol levels, which can increase your risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pay attention to dietary cholesterol, as foods high in cholesterol tend to also be high in saturated fat (though this isn’t always the case). “While research has debunked the connection between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol levels, that doesn’t mean diet can’t play a role in managing your cholesterol levels,” adds Twigge.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Good news for milk drinkers! Data suggests that regularly consuming low-fat dairy products, like milk, may protect against dying from heart disease, though more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s take a closer look at some of the benefits this go-to beverage has to offer.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apart from saturated fat, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt; is another key contributor to heart disease risk, as excess intake may increase LDL levels and reduce HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels. One study found that enjoying more than one, 12-ounce sugary drink (think: soft drinks and concentrated fruit juices) per day was associated with significant reductions in HDL and an increase in triglyceride levels—another risk factor for heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to research, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7869775/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-cut-out-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cutting back on added sugars&lt;/a&gt; can have a significant impact on your heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While it contains natural sugar (aka lactose), unflavored milk is free of added sugars, making it a solid alternative if you’re needing something a bit more exciting than water.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many ways you include low-fat milk into your weekly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/23085/cooking-methods-styles/meal-prep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal prep&lt;/a&gt;. Here are a few tips:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use It As the Base of Your Smoothie:&lt;/strong&gt; “Skip the water and use dairy milk as a nutritious base,” Twigge says. “Blend milk with riced cauliflower, frozen kale, and frozen berries for a delicious way to add protein, calcium, vitamin D, and B vitamins to a colorful smoothie recipe.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir It Into Your Breakfast:&lt;/strong&gt; Incorporate milk into your breakfast, whether you’re making a bowl of oatmeal on the stove or prepping chia seed pudding the night before.“Mix milk with chia seeds, peanut butter and freshly sliced banana for a peanut butter banana chia seed pudding that’s high in fiber and protein,” Twigge says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend It Into Homemade Pasta Sauce: &lt;/strong&gt;Incorporating milk into your favorite pasta sauce recipes is a simple way to boost the nutritional stats of your sauce. “Milk adds protein, vitamins and minerals to any creamy pasta sauce that you want to make. Pour your pasta sauce over whole grain pasta and serve it with a side salad to boost your fiber intake,” recommends Twigge.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Achieving and maintaining healthy cholesterol levels requires more than just pouring yourself a glass of low-fat milk each day. Here are three other key dietary changes to help lower cholesterol levels: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Fiber Intake:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the best ways to lower your cholesterol levels is to follow a high-fiber diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; in particular is helpful as it absorbs cholesterol from your bloodstream and helps remove it from the body. Twigge recommends looking for foods with 1 gram of fiber for every 10 grams of total carbohydrates. If you prefer not to track your nutrition stats, prioritizing plant-based foods, like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds, is a simple (yet effective) way to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;boost your fiber intake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Back on Added Sugars:&lt;/strong&gt; While you can still enjoy sweet treats, try to cut back on added sugars in your diet. In addition to raising LDL cholesterol levels, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;excess added sugar intake&lt;/a&gt; can also increase your risk of other diseases, including obesity and diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Mindful of Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt; Sodium is essential for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-electrolyte-supplement-11736890" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;electrolyte balance&lt;/a&gt; and blood pressure regulation. However, Twigge cautions that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866099/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-too-much-salt/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;high sodium intake&lt;/a&gt; can increase your risk for high blood pressure. Rather than immediately reaching for the salt shaker, try seasoning your foods with sodium-free alternatives, like lemon juice or herbs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve been diagnosed with high cholesterol, the good news is you can improve your levels by making changes to your diet. While you might worry that dairy products are off the table, research suggests that unflavored low-fat milk may actually be beneficial for supporting healthier cholesterol levels. Free of added sugar, it’s a nutritious alternative to sweetened beverages. Plus, it pairs well with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-buy-weekly-to-lower-high-cholesterol-11703900" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other cholesterol-lowering foods&lt;/a&gt;, like oats, nuts and seeds. When in doubt, consider working with a registered dietitian to help you craft a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heart-healthy meal plan&lt;/a&gt; that works for your lifestyle and dietary needs.

      &lt;p&gt;BISMARCK — After six new measles cases were reported in North Dakota over the weekend, three in Williams County in the state’s northwest corner and three in Grand Forks County, the state’s rate of confirmed cases now leads the nation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While national measles case data has been changing rapidly on a weekly and even daily basis since an outbreak began in Texas in late January, the rising outbreak in North Dakota has steadily caught up with that of New Mexico, the state which previously had the highest rate in the U.S. New Mexico and North Dakota were tied for the country’s highest rate of about 3.7 cases per 100,000 residents at the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;According to data from the North Dakota Public Health Association, on June 3, North Dakota’s rate stood alone at the top with 4.3 cases per 100,000 residents, while New Mexico’s rate stood at 3.7, with two new cases added over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the state’s rate is high, only 34 of the country’s 1,088 cases are in North Dakota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time North Dakota had the distinction of leading the country in an infectious disease outbreak rate was in the fall of 2020, when the state had the worst COVID-19 death rate in the country for 57 days straight, at one point even having the highest rate in the world for that metric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, the state had its worst whooping cough outbreak since 2012, leading to the issuance of a health advisory. Also known as pertussis, the respiratory disease is considered “very contagious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stephen McDonough, a former longtime public health officer for North Dakota, said 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/with-lower-measles-vaccine-rates-some-north-dakota-counties-may-struggle-with-virus-experts-say" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;the state’s relatively low vaccination rates,&lt;/a&gt;
    
       thanks in part to misinformation, are to blame for the recent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 1990, North Dakota was deemed the healthiest state in the nation,” he said. “But now, in the last five years, the state has had three substantial infectious disease outbreaks. This is not an aberration. This is a pattern, and a horrible one. It is indicative of very serious public health problems in the state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.hhs.nd.gov/immunizations/measles" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;according to the state’s measles tracking website,&lt;/a&gt;
    
       four North Dakota counties have reported measles cases, including seven cases in Cass County, 10 cases in Grand Forks County, one case in Burke County and 16 in Williams County.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Twenty-six of the state’s 34 reported cases are in children ages 5-19 years old. Four are in children age 4 or younger, and four are in people over the age of 20. Two people are hospitalized, and none of those infected were previously vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
      &lt;p&gt;Public health officials recommend that 95% of the population be vaccinated to prevent widespread infection. North Dakota’s rate is less than 90%, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services website says the measles vaccine is “very effective at protecting people against measles, mumps, and rubella. One dose of MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective against measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman said the department “continues to take the measles response seriously. We are actively conducting case investigations and contact tracing for every reported case.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HHS has facilitated laboratory testing, has supported access to the measles vaccine, provided a mobile medical unit, and continues to collaborate with and support local public health units,” she said, adding that the department encourages North Dakotans to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination is recommended for anyone born in 1957 or later who is 12 months of age or older. Please speak with a trusted health care provider about getting vaccinated,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. John Hoeven expressed concerns about North Dakota’s measles outbreak and encouraged residents to follow the guidance of the state’s health department to help prevent the spread. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Asked for a statement about North Dakota’s nation-leading measles rate, a spokesman for Gov. Kelly Armstrong said the governor has been “consistent in strongly encouraging anyone concerned about measles to visit with their trusted health care provider.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Julie Fedorchak called the rise in cases “concerning” and said her office is monitoring measles cases in North Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a serious illness, and I encourage North Dakotans to consult with their doctors and follow medical guidance to keep themselves and their families healthy,” she said. “State and local health officials are best positioned to respond quickly and are doing a fantastic job — including setting up vaccination clinics that are being broadly used. Vaccines are a proven protection against this disease, but with all vaccinations I trust parents and individuals to make the decisions that are best for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Health and Human Services

Kennedy Jr. said the measles vaccine hadn’t been “safety tested” and that the protection it provides wanes quickly, prompting alarm within the public health community,&lt;/a&gt;
    
       which has long attested to the safety of the vaccine and its lifelong protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

       after President Donald Trump signaled he would nominate Kennedy for the cabinet post last November, calling Kennedy’s ideas “outlandish and outrageous” and warning that the consequences for public health in North Dakota would be dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether Kennedy’s

       and 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-health-secretary-kennedy-revives-misleading-claims-fetal-debris-measles-shots-2025-05-01/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;ongoing public doubts&lt;/a&gt;
    
       might be having any impact on the spread of measles in North Dakota, Sen. Kevin Cramer called any assertion correlating the two “absurd” and “unserious.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Secretary Kennedy advocates for what pretty much every normal adult in America and North Dakota believes: consult with your health care provider and understand your vaccine options to make informed choices based on your personal circumstances,” Cramer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, McDonough said Kennedy’s actions as secretary were playing out as he predicted, pointing to 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-children-weakening-system-hhs-budget-cuts-rcna199188" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;funding cuts for critical research&lt;/a&gt;
    
       at Kennedy’s direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kennedy’s decision to terminate or curtail over 40 research projects to counter vaccine hesitancy will assure that low vaccination rates continue into the future, and vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks will continue,” McDonough said. “I doubt very much that North Dakotans want the federal government to hinder efforts to improve immunizations.”&lt;/p&gt;

"They also contain vitamin D, which helps with calcium absorption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muhlstein added that sardines are "similarly rich in omega 3s and low in mercury and can be great overall for bone health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;One cup of raw kale is considered an "excellent source" of vitamin K.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens are among the best foods for overall health, as they're packed with various &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vitamins-supplements" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrients and vitamins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nutrients and vitamins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kale is a better option in the category, Klunk said, as it's naturally lower in oxalates, chemicals that can interfere with calcium absorption. Spinach, while high in calcium, also contains oxalates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of raw kale is considered an "excellent source" of vitamin K, according to EatingWell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drizzling or massaging kale with a healthy source of fat, like olive oil or avocado oil, will help ensure proper absorption of vitamin K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright also recommends other leafy greens like Bok choy and collard greens, noting their high calcium and vitamin K content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Beans and lentils offer magnesium, phosphorus and protein, which Wright said are important for "bone remodeling and strength."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts and seeds — like almonds, chia seeds or pumpkin seeds — provide bone-supporting elements like magnesium, phosphorus and small amounts of calcium, according to Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans and lentils also offer magnesium, phosphorus and protein, which the expert noted are important for "bone remodeling and strength."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tahini, which is made from ground sesame seeds, contains high amounts of calcium, magnesium and phosphorous, which are all essential for bone structure and density, Derocha shared &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:with EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;with EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium-rich foods like nuts help regulate the parathyroid hormone, according to Muhlstein, which helps control calcium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright stressed that calcium alone isn't enough to support bone health, as its proper absorption also requires vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Don't forget supporting nutrients like magnesium, vitamin K and protein," she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Spread calcium intake throughout the day," Wright suggested. "The body absorbs calcium best in smaller doses (about 500 milligrams at a time), so space out sources, especially supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert also warns against "bone-harming" habits, such as consuming too much sodium, caffeine &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/beer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:or alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;or alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, or not getting enough fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/foods-should-eating-stronger-bones-according-nutritionists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6 foods you should be eating for stronger bones, according to nutritionists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;6 foods you should be eating for stronger bones, according to nutritionists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:32:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5hVkY4V3ljaVBGZ21GV3VPRjBvTE16alhPMUw4QkFUQmNjWHJBNkpjZmhhRHZTa0VWQmdCYWZ2dllQaHRGU2FabWNBb0hwekd6ZTRwNi1jUnp1NkprZzM0ZktoRDNBRlJLVDFxNk1XbnFEQQ</guid></item><item><title>废水现在正在帮助跟踪麻疹在美国各地的传播- CNN | Wastewater is now helping track measles spread around the US - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE4wMUowcVZxZjVLc2d3bjFDdVNZbGtBZG5BSmVYdnpNblNtVlo3VlFFV3NwQ2I4cGlUN1NkaXJDekRiYV9ZVEd2YjlySnZtMWh6ZkU4alVKR2Z6YXFjNjFMb1REdERJczlNbDRBRWJLVVdNdGZL0gF6QVVfeXFMT1BvSVgxNDFkRGlUSjB1T0FKZ0p5ak9Zcl9GM2xwNzNiYjROOTZ0NEFMb1NFd0lsZ1Zka2E3WGlqcW5CNkFWXzZCdW4ySUZfR2lJSlZmS2RZcmp3X3NQbFlPeE5XdkdyTUhMTnFTVjlxcVVhM3ljbVdZYWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            As measles cases rise to precipitously high levels in the US this year, there’s a new tool to help track the spread: wastewater.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhweerj000l3b6m6xjhcii4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wastewater surveillance rose to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic, as testing sewage for virus particles helped provide early warning signs of increased transmission and fill the gaps as case reporting scaled back.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwj8bv000o3b6moqjaayey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

It has the potential to identify possible cases days before an individual shows symptoms or seeks care. The new tool is available for use in nearly 150 wastewater treatment facilities across 40 states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwawoi004d28p811qgc727@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 1,157 measles cases have been reported in the US this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p200023b6mqvyey1li@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A large multistate outbreak centered in West Texas accounts for the vast majority. Texas has reported 742 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico reported 81 cases, and Oklahoma reported 18 cases – 15 confirmed and three probable – as of Tuesday. Cases in Kansas, which the state health department says may also be linked to the outbreak, have reached 71 as of Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p200033b6mgukaxrbm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say these numbers are all a severe undercount because many cases are going unreported. However, the nation is now fewer than 120 cases away from the total reported for all of 2019, the year with the highest number of measles cases – 1,274 - since the disease was declared eliminated in the US in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p200043b6mpfc9zw0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            South Dakota reported its first measles case of the year Monday, bringing the total number of states that have reported at least one case in 2025 up to 33.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300053b6mi2dgqupu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new case in South Dakota is in an adult who travelled internationally, according to a news release from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300063b6mifju2ldh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently updated its measles guidance for travelers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300073b6mdyefy3ib@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” a CDC &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; says. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune. CDC recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to any international destination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300083b6m63saybhz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other recent examples include a case in Minnesota that was reported in an adult who was exposed during domestic air travel, and the New Jersey health department has warned of potential measles exposure in the Newark airport.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p300093b6mwwj4n49w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been at least 14 outbreaks in the US this year, according to the CDC, accounting for 90% of cases. The CDC’s data is limited to confirmed cases and lags behind CNN’s tally for this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000a3b6mzdmmtvan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of cases in the US this year have been in people who are unvaccinated; only about 5% of confirmed cases have been in people who had received one or two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000b3b6m82era98s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses as the best protection against the disease, with the first dose given at 12 to 15 months of age and the second between ages 4 and 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000c3b6mli7093zg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Childhood vaccination rates have been declining across the US for years, with MMR vaccination coverage among &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/health/measles-vaccine-coverage-kindergarten-school-requirement"&gt;kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; falling below the recommended 95% threshold for at least four years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000d3b6mo9z9uidb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2834892" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from Johns Hopkins University, published Monday in the journal JAMA, emphasizes how widespread the decline has been. MMR vaccination rates among children have dropped in more than three-quarters of US counties, with an average drop of 2.7% between 2017 and 2024, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000e3b6m3cnuiu74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination rates have surged in some places that are experiencing measles outbreaks, however. In New Mexico, nearly twice as many MMR vaccines have been administered this year than there were at this point last year, according to data from the state health department. And a recent &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/2025-early-measles-vaccinations-in-texas/" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of health records by Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, shows that early vaccination rates jumped among infants in Texas. MMR vaccination rates among 6-month-olds in Texas this year are more than eight times higher than they were in 2019, and in March and April, about 1 in 5 children who received their first measles shot in Texas had gotten it early, before their first birthday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbhwb1p3000f3b6mzkuxrlol@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 133 people with measles have been hospitalized this year, according to the CDC, and there have been three deaths: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength and balance naturally decline as we age, but that doesn’t mean we’re powerless to prevent it. While aging is inevitable, staying strong doesn’t require a pricey gym membership. With the right habits, even simple daily movements can help preserve mobility and independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is well known for its health benefits at any age, from boosting cardiovascular fitness to strengthening bones. At Tom’s Guide, we’ve tested everything from Japanese walking techniques to rucking and the 5-4-5 method to get more out of our steps, using the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to monitor progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s one everyday activity that deserves more attention for its strength-building potential, and that's stair climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research, stair climbing can build muscle power, improve balance, and offer similar benefits to traditional gym workouts for older adults. It is a low-cost and accessible way to stay strong, steady, and independent, with benefits that go far beyond just getting from one floor to the next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-does-the-research-say"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What does the research say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39590559/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39590559/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/a&gt;, researchers compared stair climbing with traditional resistance training in adults over 70. Both groups improved in lower-body strength and everyday tasks like walking and standing up from a chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who climbed stairs performed better in stair-climbing tests, which may not come as a surprise, but reinforces the idea that simple, familiar movements can be just as effective as a gym session. For anyone looking to stay strong without lifting weights, this is good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-stair-climbing-works"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why stair climbing works&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climbing stairs works your glutes, quads, and calves, and also challenges your balance with every step. It’s a simple way to build strength and stability at the same time. It also gets your heart pumping, so even a few minutes can count as a quick cardio session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DYq4ipryXA4nKXJUnDrSLM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DYq4ipryXA4nKXJUnDrSLM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/316" target="_blank" data-url="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/316" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, short bursts of vigorous activity like stair climbing can significantly improve heart health. In women, researchers found that climbing stairs for just four to five minutes a day was linked to a reduced risk of heart disease and a healthier, longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-incorporate-stair-climbing-into-your-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to incorporate stair climbing into your routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not ready to take on multiple flights? Start with a short stair circuit. Climb up and down a few steps for a few minutes at a steady pace to get your heart rate up and engage your lower body muscles. Use a handrail for support if needed, wear stable, supportive shoes, and focus on strong, controlled movements. Even a five-minute stair session can feel surprisingly effective and help build strength and stamina over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re already active and want more of a challenge, try increasing your pace, adding more flights, or using a stair climber machine at the gym to build endurance and intensity. Whatever your starting point, stair climbing is easy to scale up or down. Just remember to check in with your doctor if you have any health concerns before beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’re looking for more simple ways to move, try boosting your metabolism with this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#"&gt;5,000-step walking workout&lt;/a&gt;, adding extra steps with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#"&gt;the habit stacking trick&lt;/a&gt;, or mixing things up with the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="#"&gt;6-6-6 walking challenge&lt;/a&gt; for a more structured routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="Fitbit Charge 6,fitbit inspire 3,Amazfit Band 7,forerunner 265,Amazfit Active,Garmin Venu 3,Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,Whoop 4.0,Apple Watch Series 10,Oura Ring 4" data-name="Buying Guide Multimodel widget" data-widget-title="multimodelWidgetTitle" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-base"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Round up of today's best deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-items-container" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Mon, Jun 16, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Mon, Jun 16, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Tue, Jun 17, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Tue, Jun 17, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-container" data-expandable="0" data-stacked="0" data-load-more="true" role="button" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-main-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-main" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0" data-expanded="0"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-grid-item-block-container hawk-multimodel-review-items-grid-item-block" data-name="countdown" data-product-type="1000" data-button-type="" data-stacked="0"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-deal-countdown-in-progress"&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-label"&gt;Deal ends &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="hawk-deal-countdown-time-string"&gt;Mon, Jun 16, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

Using mice aged 2 to 23 months, scientists found that older mice experienced 4–6 times more BBB breakdown than younger mice under similar hypoxic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed increased brain inflammation in older mice, regardless of oxygen level. These findings may explain why elderly individuals with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular issues are at greater risk for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heightened Vulnerability:&lt;/strong&gt; Aged mice showed significantly more BBB disruption at higher oxygen levels than younger mice, indicating increased sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglial activation, a marker of brain inflammation, was elevated in older mice even under normal oxygen conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repair Deficit:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite steady blood vessel growth across ages, older brains exhibited impaired BBB repair, suggesting weakened vascular resilience with age.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Impact Journals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a new study, researchers Arjun Sapkota, Sebok K. Halder, and Richard Milner from San Diego Biomedical Research Institute investigated how aging affects the brain’s vulnerability to low oxygen, or hypoxia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using C57BL/6J mice ranging from 2 to 23 months of age, they identified specific oxygen levels that disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB)—a critical structure that protects brain tissue from harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110645"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a person and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/oxygen-brain-aging-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The BBB is essential for maintaining brain health. In this study, mild and prolonged hypoxia—called chronic mild hypoxia—was found to compromise the BBB in mice. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are important for understanding age-related cognitive decline and the potential risks faced by individuals with chronic oxygen-limiting conditions such as asthma, sleep apnea, emphysema, and heart disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BBB is essential for maintaining brain health. In this study, mild and prolonged hypoxia—called chronic mild hypoxia—was found to compromise the BBB in mice. Older mice showed significantly more BBB disruption than younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, barrier weakening and blood vessel changes occurred at oxygen levels of just 15% in aged mice, compared to 13% in young mice. These data suggest that the aging brain is more sensitive to oxygen deprivation, even at levels that may be considered only mildly hypoxic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also determined when this vulnerability emerged. The BBB showed increased sensitivity to low oxygen not only in aged mice but also in mice as young as 2 to 6 months, with a second spike occurring between 12 and 15 months—equivalent to middle age in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings may reflect age-dependent changes in brain vascular function and remodeling capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hypoxia-induced endothelial proliferation was relatively constant across the age range, but advanced age strongly enhanced the degree of BBB disruption (4-6-fold greater in 23 months vs. 2 months old).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key focus was microglial activation, a sign of brain inflammation. Aged mice exhibited higher microglial activation across all oxygen levels, including normal conditions. Chronic microglial activation is closely linked to neuroinflammation and has been implicated in diseases such as Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the rate of blood vessel formation was constant across ages, the degree of BBB disruption increased sharply with age, suggesting that repair mechanisms may weaken over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These results may help explain why older adults with chronic hypoxia-related diseases are at higher risk for neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The study also draws attention to the risks of high-altitude exposure for aging populations, where oxygen levels naturally drop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Altogether, these findings underscore the importance of protecting brain health in older individuals by managing oxygen exposure and reducing hypoxia-related risks. The researchers emphasize the need to develop new therapies that support blood-brain barrier integrity, particularly in aging populations exposed to chronic or intermittent low-oxygen conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and hypoxia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5f323a3b363e1f36322f3e3c2b35302a2d313e332c713c3032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ryan Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://impactjournals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan Braithwaite – Impact Journals &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.18632/aging.206241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Defining the hypoxic thresholds that trigger blood-brain barrier disruption: the effect of age&lt;/a&gt;” by Arjun Sapkota et al. &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the hypoxic thresholds that trigger blood-brain barrier disruption: the effect of age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic mild hypoxia (CMH; 8% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) triggers transient blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, an effect greatly increased with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As BBB disruption predisposes to neuronal death and cognitive decline, here we defined the hypoxic thresholds that trigger BBB breakdown in young and aged mice, and then defined the age at which hypoxia-induced BBB disruption significantly increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual-immunofluorescence of brain sections demonstrated that the thresholds required to trigger hypoxia-induced BBB disruption (CD31/fibrinogen) and endothelial proliferation (CD31/Ki67) were much lower in aged mice (15% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) compared to young (13% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia-induced endothelial proliferation was relatively constant across the age range, but advanced age strongly enhanced the degree of BBB disruption (4-6-fold greater in 23 months vs. 2 months old).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the BBB became more vulnerable to hypoxic disruption at 12–15 months, a large step-up also occurred at the surprisingly young age 2–6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data demonstrates that the aged BBB is far more sensitive to hypoxia-induced BBB disruption than the young and define the hypoxic thresholds that trigger hypoxia-induced BBB disruption in young and aged mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This information has translational implications for people exposed to hypoxia and for those living with hypoxia-associated conditions such as asthma, emphysema, ischemic heart disease, and apnea.&lt;/p&gt;

and is encouraging international travelers to get vaccinated (or confirm their vaccination status) against the measles virus before heading abroad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Measles is an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected,” the CDC advisory reads. “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to the ongoing risk, the CDC advises all travelers going to or from an international destination to be fully vaccinated against measles. For travelers who are not yet vaccinated or unable to get vaccinated, the government agency encourages people to consult a medical professional and consider postponing their trip until the risk is assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory was last reviewed on May 28 by the CDC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denver International Airport is one site that health authorities have closely monitored as a source of several recent measles cases. At least four passengers on a recent Turkish Airlines flight reportedly caught measles, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-public-health-officials-release-additional-locations-for-potential-measles" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Public health officials are notifying members of the public of additional areas for potential measles exposures, as a result of these confirmed cases,” the Colorado advisory states. “The adults are unrelated, but were at Denver International Airport around the same time on Wednesday, May 14.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been 1,088 confirmed cases of measles in the United States in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Ninety-six percent of the cases have been unvaccinated or whose status was unknown, and only 12 percent of cases have required hospitalization. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-measles-travel-warning-spread-in-airplane/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CBS News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, a CDC spokesperson said there have been 62 cases of measles that tie back to international travel thus far in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The virus spreads through coughing and sneezing, and can remain in the air for up to two hours, the CDC advisory states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/cdc-international-travel-advisory-measles-vaccination-11747257" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Travel &amp;amp; Leisure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Travel &amp;amp; Leisure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBySXlESDkwWU9SUkRWRFZQY0xxZ29fSF84TGJDTFhoRURnSUh1ZURXdW9aMHpucWFMQkFmUmd2Njc4aXBrZkpyZUF4S2hwY0VScVFwVzA3ZWtwcC1OMi1CSmFsbHN4QXhGdGlKXzBzdjlSWk5HSFE</guid></item><item><title>失乐园：患者被告知离开医院避风港-旧金山标准 | Paradise lost: Patients told to leave hospital haven - The San Francisco Standard</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOS2dxNzlFQlJXSWw1U0ZBZ2h0OHJjMHVLRzlhM1N1QjR6NXNHZ1BINHVrNHFmQlo0MG5MT2JPeDNTcUo4RUxKME5QV1I3Z3VRdTBkcmtnM0FkVGFYbThSSHgyTDBqUlJ6cEFDZVBhN2pGdm9qcEFxQzRmT1Z2RFZJdFMwY0JvQTZBT1MwSUxUMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="paragraph-block article-body undefined text-left" id=""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela, who has schizophrenia and a history of violence, also spent time on the streets and in jail.

The study’s authors found that plunging your limbs into icy water after lifting weights slows blood flow to muscles, hampering their ability to recover and grow, potentially reducing the benefits of the workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAJUHVAIN5GXLN37ROMWYQJKGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It looks like it’s not a great idea” to soak in freezing water after lifting weights, said Milan Betz, a doctoral student at Maastricht University in the Netherlands, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VEUD4SUYT5C3NMDLMOU2EG5VCU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings add to mounting evidence that ice baths may undermine the effects of lifting and also raise the provocative issue of when, if ever, ice baths are a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JHRPQAZOAJBRNESUQ4HEYEMY74" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JHRPQAZOAJBRNESUQ4HEYEMY74" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Muscles that are 20 percent smaller&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6675K6JXONF4XNFBVTFASXJC3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Fans of cold plunging typically say the practice is beneficial for both body and mind, lifting moods, building grit, soothing aches and stiffness, and, perhaps above all, speeding up and intensifying recovery from exercise, so you get more from each workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQSPKRIEONAD3JV7ZDNHXDXXUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But little science has supported the purported benefits of ice baths, and in recent years, studies have frequently undercut them. In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26174323/" target="_blank"&gt;2015 experiment&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, scientists in Australia asked 21 men to lift weights twice a week. Half of the men cold plunged after every session; the others didn’t. After three months, the cold plungers’ muscles were nearly 20 percent smaller and weaker than the other men’s, although everyone followed the same exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MZHU57IHZ5GEDP56W36V5OWBHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Similarly, a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsc.12074" target="_blank"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt; of prior research, cheekily titled “Throwing Cold Water on Muscle Growth,” concluded that the best available research indicated cold plunges after resistance training can “attenuate hypertrophic changes.” In other words, your muscles won’t grow as much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JVBZ6KA5NNFI3EL4HDE6APG4U4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JVBZ6KA5NNFI3EL4HDE6APG4U4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What happens to blood flow after a cold plunge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4M2QYTIMC5FABHWS2PVWLHUQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How would cold water undo resistance exercise? The review’s authors speculated that frigid temperatures shrink blood vessels, impeding blood flow to muscles. Blood carries nutrients, including protein, that muscles rely on to rebuild and bulk up after draining exercise. Less blood flow means less protein and a feebler recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XBE5CRTA5AHFOTIEQFQBSUGDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But no study had yet shown that process in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FH25FO64CBH5PM3VB2LIX6HMZY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Enter Betz and his colleagues. They wanted to see what happens to blood flow after ice baths, so they recruited 12 healthy young men and used portable ultrasound machines to track baseline blood flow in their legs as they rested at the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LC4YHNYITBGXVH4TIRUPFDJBHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The volunteers then sweated though a tough session of leg press and leg extension exercises, before immediately clambering onto a bicycle-like contraption with large buckets where the pedals should be. One contained tepid 80-degree water, the other icy 30-degree water. The men slid a leg into each bucket, so one limb cold plunged, the other didn’t, and stayed there for 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WM5I5ZUCQRAU7MHSCN5MSPESKY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Afterward, the volunteers drank a recovery shake containing protein molecules marked with a biochemical tracer. Researchers could track the tracer to see whether the proteins wound up in muscles or not. The scientists also checked blood flow with an ultrasound several more times over the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FPQK7UCVO5AJJKXVSIBQG6WYNQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FPQK7UCVO5AJJKXVSIBQG6WYNQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Cold plunges may undo benefits of weight training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W54OQLHMSVDPRBAT5ZROEE5PQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What they found was that blood flow dropped substantially in the volunteers’ cold-plunged leg, compared to their other limb, and stayed low for hours. The muscles in that chilled leg consequently received and absorbed far less protein from the shake. Over time, this reduced protein intake would likely mean blunted gains in strength and muscle mass from the lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MDGYNPPXQVACVMNU6OFTHF72O4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The results “provide confirmatory evidence” that cold plunges can alter the desired effects of weight training by reducing blood flow and protein uptake, said Brad Schoenfeld, an exercise scientist at Lehman College in New York, who studies resistance training and co-wrote the 2024 review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWTLBP6TGVDJXMONGHDIKQX23I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But this was a single, small study, and many questions remain unanswered. Would ice bathing likewise affect recovery from other exercise? “I would think you’d see similar effects with other sports” such as running, cycling and team sports, Betz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HWIVTTIIGVGJ3CNKBDH5EC2XCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What about the effects on women and older people, who weren’t studied here? Betz said he believes, again, the impacts would be much the same in almost everyone, but those studies need to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUTSNPKQZJHW3EMRKCQE527ZOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s also unclear whether and to what extent timing and other details matter, said Denis Blondin, a professor of health sciences who studies metabolism and cold exposure at the University of Sherbrooke in Canada. He wasn’t involved with the new study. Maybe ice baths several hours after a workout would have different effects on muscles, he said, as might tweaking how long you soak, how much of your body is submerged and the water’s exact temperature. More large-scale research is needed to understand the nuances of cold soaks and exercise response, Blondin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IOOP36Y4YVDXROSJN3CX4XZOMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some people also ice bathe for reasons unrelated to exercise recovery, including to make themselves feel mentally stronger and more resilient. The new study did not consider psychological outcomes from chilling out, Betz said, and, if you find comfort in cold plunges, “there’s no reason to change your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YXJIJFRIPNGSDPL5WZODKVX53M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But, to get the most gains from weight training, he said, the bulk of the available evidence, including the new study, suggest you should probably skip an ice bath soon afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJCSBX3EJZEXHDPDBGOTAQKI3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a fitness question?

    &lt;p&gt;Some of the most complex cognitive functions are possible because &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/pen.2020.6"&gt;different sides of your brain&lt;/a&gt; control them. Chief among them is &lt;a href="https://nmoer.pressbooks.pub/cognitivepsychology/chapter/lack-of-invariance/"&gt;speech perception&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to interpret language. In people, the speech perception process is typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/331585a0"&gt;dominated by the left hemisphere&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your brain breaks apart fleeting streams of acoustic information into &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0093-934X(03)00351-1"&gt;parallel channels&lt;/a&gt; – linguistic, emotional and musical – and acts as a biological multicore processor. Although scientists have recognized this division of cognitive labor &lt;a href="https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2301213/component/file_2452907/content"&gt;for over 160 years&lt;/a&gt;, the mechanisms underpinning it remain poorly understood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers know that distinct subgroups of neurons &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaz3468"&gt;must be tuned&lt;/a&gt; to different frequencies and timing of sound. In recent decades, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/325249a0"&gt;studies on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14402"&gt;animal models&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10690-3"&gt;especially in rodents&lt;/a&gt;, have confirmed that splitting sound processing across the brain is not uniquely human, opening the door to more closely dissecting how this occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet a central puzzle persists: What makes near-identical regions in opposite hemispheres of the brain process different types of information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering that question promises broader insight into how experience sculpts neural circuits during critical periods of early development, and why that process is disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Timing is everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensory processing of sounds begins in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK531483/"&gt;the cochlea&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the inner ear where sound frequencies are converted into electricity and forwarded to the auditory cortex of the brain. Researchers believe that the division of labor across brain hemispheres required to recognize sound patterns begins in this region. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, &lt;a href="https://neuroscience.wustl.edu/people/hysell-oviedo-phd/"&gt;my work as a neuroscientist&lt;/a&gt; has focused on the auditory cortex. &lt;a href="https://oviedolab.org/"&gt;My lab&lt;/a&gt; has shown that mice process sound differently in the left and right hemispheres of their brains, and we have worked to tease apart the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10690-3"&gt;underlying circuitry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we’ve found the left side of the brain has more focused, specialized connections that may help detect key features of speech, such as distinguishing one word from another. Meanwhile, the right side is more broadly connected, suited for processing melodies and the intonation of speech.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Auditory_Pathway.png"&gt;Jonathan E. Peelle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tackled the question of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58891-3"&gt;how these left-right differences in hearing develop&lt;/a&gt; in our latest work, and our results underscore the adage that timing is everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We tracked how neural circuits in the left and right auditory cortex develop from early life to adulthood. To do this, we recorded electrical signals in mouse brains to observe how the auditory cortex matures and to see how sound experiences shape its structure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, we found that the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58891-3"&gt;right hemisphere consistently outpaced the left&lt;/a&gt; in development, showing more rapid growth and refinement. This suggests there are critical windows of development – brief periods when the brain is especially adaptive and sensitive to environmental sound – specific to each hemisphere that occur at different times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test the consequences of this asynchrony, we exposed young mice to specific tones during these sensitive periods. In adulthood, we found that where sound is processed in their brains was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58891-3"&gt;permanently skewed&lt;/a&gt;. Animals that heard tones during the right hemisphere’s earlier critical window had an overrepresentation of those frequencies mapped in the right auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding yet another layer of complexity, we found that these critical windows &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58891-3"&gt;vary by sex&lt;/a&gt;. The right hemisphere critical window opens earlier in female mice, and the left hemisphere window opens just days later. In contrast, male mice had a very sensitive right hemisphere critical window, but no detectable window on the left. This points to the elusive role sex may play in brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide a new way to understand how different hemispheres of the brain process sound and why this might vary for different people. They also provide evidence that parallel areas of the brain are not interchangeable: the brain can encode the same sound in radically different ways, depending on when it occurs and which hemisphere is primed to receive it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Speech and neurodevelopment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The division of labor between brain hemispheres is a hallmark of many human cognitive functions, especially language. This is often disrupted in neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism and schizophrenia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reduced language information encoding in the left hemisphere is a strong indication of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4575-09.2010"&gt;auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. And a shift from left- to right-hemisphere language processing is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.382"&gt;characteristic of autism&lt;/a&gt;, where language development is often impaired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/671673/original/file-20250602-56-2kqkyn.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Children with certain neurodevelopmental conditions may have trouble processing speech.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/child-girl-having-ear-pain-touching-his-painful-ear-royalty-free-image/1398019642"&gt;Towfiqu Ahamed/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, the right hemisphere of people with autism seems to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-022-05696-8"&gt;respond earlier to sound&lt;/a&gt; than the left hemisphere, echoing the accelerated right-side maturation we saw in our study on mice. Our findings suggest that this early dominance of the right hemisphere in encoding sound information might amplify its control of auditory processing, deepening the imbalance between hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These insights deepen our understanding of how language-related areas in the brain typically develop and can help scientists design earlier and more targeted treatments to support early speech, especially for children with neurodevelopmental language disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

That’s how it’s supposed to work in theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But slaughterhouses operate at a rapid, hectic pace, with animals sometimes stunned improperly and butchered while still alive and conscious. If a cow remained conscious once they got to Tom — as was the case with this cow in particular, whose calf was partially hanging out of her birth canal — he was unable to stop the line to ensure they were properly killed. So, as the cow kicked at him, mid-birth, he had no choice but to skin her alive. The calf didn’t survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It takes 25 seconds&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;“ to skin them, he said in&lt;em&gt; The Dying Trade&lt;/em&gt;, “but it stays with you for the rest of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Tom, who calls himself a “devout animal lover,” said that it’s “very difficult watching animals being killed.” But the job desensitizes you: “You become a robot.” Other slaughterhouse workers have made &lt;a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32165-24-2-hemenwaypdf"&gt;similar remarks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Ducks hang upside down from a processing line as workers hang more animals on the line at a duck farm’s on-site slaughterhouse in Portugal that also slaughters animals from nearby farms.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Human Cruelties/We Animals&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To cope, Tom spent most of his slaughterhouse career as a functioning alcoholic, drinking as soon as he got off work until he went to bed. He took magic mushrooms on weekends to escape. He also dissociated at work, spending much of his time on the production line “thinking I was on holiday…I would dream I was in Spain somewhere — just anywhere but what I was doing.” Now, he said, he lives like a hermit and still dreams about slaughterhouses six to seven nights a week. He also has violent thoughts of hurting people, which he had never had prior to working in meat processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I suffer with PITS as a result,” Tom said, referring to &lt;a href="https://perpetrationtrauma.org/"&gt;perpetration-induced traumatic stress&lt;/a&gt;, a subcategory of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, in which the cause of the trauma is being a perpetrator of violence — in this case, slaughtering animals for food — rather than being a victim of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="/future-perfect/405972/trump-slaughter-line-speed-poultry-pork"&gt;Physical injury rates are high in slaughterhouses&lt;/a&gt;, making it one of the more dangerous occupations. But much less is known about the mental and emotional toll of slaughterhouse work. Psychology researchers have difficulty accessing slaughterhouse worker populations, and so we’re left with a handful of &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248380211030243"&gt;small studies&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, it’s unknown exactly what share of the world’s millions of slaughterhouse workers suffer from PTSD or other mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But what’s certain is that many do — surveys of slaughterhouse workers show high rates of anxiety and depression, and &lt;a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/31/how-killing-animals-everyday-leaves-slaughterhouse-workers-traumatised-7175087/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/32165-24-2-hemenwaypdf"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; stories of &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/10/06/denver-slaughterhouse-ban-ordinance-309/"&gt;mental health struggles&lt;/a&gt; with researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-50986683"&gt;journalists&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is likely to worsen in the years ahead, as more and more slaughterhouses are built around the world to &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2023/07/oecd-fao-agricultural-outlook-2023-2032_859ba0c2.html"&gt;satisfy increasing meat consumption&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Two years ago, the American Medical Association’s Journal of Ethics even devoted an &lt;a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/issue/meat-and-health"&gt;entire issue&lt;/a&gt; to the meat industry’s effects on societal health, including its impact on workers. &lt;a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/how-should-clinicians-respond-patients-experiencing-ongoing-present-traumatic-stress-industrial-meat/2023-04"&gt;One article&lt;/a&gt; by social psychologist &lt;a href="https://rachelmacnair.com/"&gt;Rachel MacNair&lt;/a&gt;, who coined the term PITS, put the psychological toll of slaughterhouse work — and society’s complicity in the problem — in blunt terms: “Public demand for meat creates ongoing, present, and future exposure to trauma and continual retraumatization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-we-know-about-the-psychological-toll-of-slaughterhouse-work" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we know about the psychological toll of slaughterhouse work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The concept of PTSD stems from studies of combat veterans, research that accelerated in the post-Vietnam War era in the US. It was officially recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental health condition in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it took time for psychologists to recognize that being the one who perpetrates violence — as opposed to experiencing or witnessing it — can also be highly traumatic, or even more so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a 1998 study, MacNair told me, she observed that Vietnam War veterans who directly killed people had higher trauma scores than those who only witnessed killing. In 2002, she published the first book on the issue — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/perpetrationinduced-traumatic-stress-9780313012501/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress: The Psychological Consequences of Killing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which went beyond war and into other arenas of violence, including policing, death penalty executions, torture, homicide, and slaughterhouse work. The idea has since expanded how psychologists think about traumatization from violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Slaughterhouse work can also deeply impact those who don’t directly kill animals but still play a critical role in meat production, like David Magna, a former slaughterhouse inspector for the Canadian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For six years, Magna worked at a major chicken plant, where one of his jobs entailed standing behind employees on the slaughter line — which operated at the breakneck speed of 180 birds per minute — to check for signs of disease and other issues. He also inspected crates of chickens as they were unloaded to be slaughtered; sometimes, hundreds would arrive dead from &lt;a href="/future-perfect/414338/chick-usps-animal-transport-meat"&gt;exposure to extreme heat or cold&lt;/a&gt; during transportation from the factory farm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After six years at the chicken slaughterhouse, Magna developed severe respiratory problems, requiring him to take time off (it’s not uncommon for poultry workers to complain about the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-chicken-plants-chemicals-blamed-for-health-ailments-are-poised-to-proliferate/2013/04/25/d2a65ec8-97b1-11e2-97cd-3d8c1afe4f0f_story.html"&gt;toxic, bacteria-killing chemicals used in slaughterhouses&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the next decade, Magna went on to work as an inspector at other plants along with a desk job in which he reviewed animal welfare violation reports, including a number of disturbing cases. In one, a farmer branded some of his pigs a dozen or so times each with a hot iron all over their bodies, but was only penalized with a fine and was allowed to continue to raise animals for meat. In another case, a truckload of pigs froze to death after a driver fell asleep. One report involved a pregnant dairy cow who gave birth on a slaughterhouse-bound truck. Because the trailer was so crowded, the calf’s head was smashed in by other cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Pigs lie dying on a bloody slaughterhouse floor in Canada as a worker stands over them before pushing them into a scalding tank.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I’m a shell of what I was when I walked in that [first] day,” Magna told me. Throughout his career, he’d try to improve conditions, but the deck was stacked against him: regulations are weak, violators face little to no penalties, and higher-ups often didn’t take his concerns seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Like Tom, the slaughterhouse worker in Europe, Magna drank excessively to cope. He also had dreams in which he was a chicken packed in a crate and then slaughtered. His mother, who had briefly worked on the slaughter line, had similar dreams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Objects like a plate of meat or a truck can trigger flashbacks for Magna. He’s dealt with suicidal ideation, and a few years ago, he was diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Gathering broader data on the experiences of people who work in slaughterhouses has proven difficult, but there is some. A few years ago, a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15248380211030243"&gt;literature review&lt;/a&gt; by psychologists Jessica Slade and Emma Alleyne at the University of Kent found slaughterhouse workers have higher rates of anxiety and depression, and a higher propensity for physical aggression. A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/qhw.v11.30266#d1e614"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; of slaughterhouse workers in South Africa found that each had recurring nightmares, like Tom and David, and &lt;a href="https://awakenwfu.com/2023/04/21/the-human-cost-of-animal-slaughter/"&gt;some workers&lt;/a&gt; have reported &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228141419_A_Slaughterhouse_Nightmare_Psychological_Harm_Suffered_by_Slaughterhouse_Employees_and_the_Possibility_of_Redress_through_Legal_Reform"&gt;high rates of alcoholism&lt;/a&gt; in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s been no large-scale study investigating PTSD rates among slaughterhouse workers, and there’s a good reason why: It would be hard to conduct such a study without cooperation from meat companies. And many slaughterhouse workers are undocumented immigrants who might be reluctant to share their stories, even if they were anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="this-system-oppresses-everyone" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This system oppresses everyone” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some people who live near factory farms, which produce &lt;a href="/future-perfect/395967/iowa-factory-farm-pollution-sacrifice-state"&gt;vast amounts of animal manure that pollutes the air and water&lt;/a&gt;, call their communities &lt;a href="https://www.greatplainsaction.org/single-post/end-stage-iowa"&gt;“sacrifice zones”&lt;/a&gt; for the meat and agricultural industries.

For whatever reason, I’m here today doing this, and I think of the people that aren’t so lucky.” He mentioned a former coworker, Maria, who had to get carpal tunnel surgery like many other slaughterhouse workers, due to intense wrist pain from making repetitive cuts to animal carcasses. When Magna asked her why she’s still working at the plant, she told him that because she doesn’t speak English, she doesn’t have many options. She said she has to continue on to provide for her kids — that her own life doesn’t matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“This system,” Magna said, “oppresses everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/future-perfect"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Perfect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; newsletter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPYVBwYUtGZkJlbXVpY0txTGdDdjdPelZma3Jtd3FZY3B3SnYwTlhsbTN2UHliWTQ5cTc0bmJuVTBVTUdDTEhhMXhGYi0waFZpMjdsU3ozWlNHcE9BSk9hY2U2ZnNhVldGZnBOeEY2RlFHZ0VqVWowNFpfYTYyUWFOTzE5RURzc08wejZvM2R0VGtjZw</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心健康咨询称，这种“持续风险”使旅行者在飞机、火车、公共交通等方面处于弱势-旅行+休闲 | CDC Health Advisory Says This 'Ongoing Risk' Leaves Travelers Vulnerable on Planes, Trains, Public Transport, and More - Travel + Leisure</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNNlJFd3NnelVWSThUZS02MzBCTEtYSGF3LXJvN0pWQmQ5X0xEX1Z2azVyNnd2UHZITURzcEFEcWE0SUUxYWUwVDVtNHJVS0VqTWMtR2VUMUJQUk5KbnNiQ1U0NmxmQnNnYnhwaXlwdEhZRkVxUFg5SmhfMW00Ml85dktDbjk0MHV6czlESzNTajhJYWV4dHFROUVhMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="travelandleisure-sc-page_1-0" class="comp travelandleisure-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block travelandleisure-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A surge of measles cases has caused the CDC to update its advisory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CDC recommends that travelers should get vaccinated to prevent measles before traveling internationally.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are at least 1,088 confirmed cases of measles in the United States, according to CDC data.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent outbreak of measles has caused a leading health authority to update guidance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;travel advisory&lt;/a&gt; and is encouraging international travelers to get vaccinated (or confirm their vaccination status) against the measles virus before heading abroad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Measles is an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected,” the CDC advisory reads. “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In response to the ongoing risk, the CDC advises all travelers going to or from an international destination to be fully vaccinated against measles. For travelers who are not yet vaccinated or unable to get vaccinated, the government agency encourages people to consult a medical professional and consider postponing their trip until the risk is assessed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The advisory was last reviewed on May 28 by the CDC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Denver International Airport is one site that health authorities have closely monitored as a source of several recent measles cases. At least four passengers on a recent Turkish Airlines flight reportedly caught measles, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/colorado-public-health-officials-release-additional-locations-for-potential-measles" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
“Public health officials are notifying members of the public of additional areas for potential measles exposures, as a result of these confirmed cases,” the Colorado advisory states. “The adults are unrelated, but were at Denver International Airport around the same time on Wednesday, May 14.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There have been 1,088 confirmed cases of measles in the United States in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Ninety-six percent of the cases have been unvaccinated or whose status was unknown, and only 12 percent of cases have required hospitalization. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-measles-travel-warning-spread-in-airplane/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;, a CDC spokesperson said there have been 62 cases of measles that tie back to international travel thus far in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The virus spreads through coughing and sneezing, and can remain in the air for up to two hours, the CDC advisory states.&lt;br&gt;

These objects appear to trace back as far as 1.5 million years, shining a spotlight on an era when early humans were shaping simple tools for daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finds come from a pilot &lt;a href="https://press.vub.ac.be/vub-researcher-discovers-hand-axes-that-may-go-back-15-million-years-ago-in-iraqi-desert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; examining surface materials scattered across a dried landscape that once held a vast Pleistocene lake. Archaeologist and researcher, &lt;a href="https://amgc.research.vub.be/dr-ella-egberts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Ella Egberts&lt;/a&gt;, is continuing this work at &lt;a href="https://www.vub.be/nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vrije Universiteit Brussel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-a-vanished-water-source"&gt;Tracing a vanished water source&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remnants of an ancient lakebed in the Iraqi Western Desert set the stage for intriguing discoveries. Fossilized river channels crisscross this parched terrain, hinting that it was once a lifeline for early humans who may have wandered near water for sustenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators identified seven &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Paleolithic-Period" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paleolithic&lt;/a&gt; sites in an area measuring about 6 by 12 miles, selecting one location for a focused look at how objects from different periods were arranged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/geomorphology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;geomorphology&lt;/a&gt;, the study of landform development, crucial in linking these surface deposits to climatic shifts over thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-earliest-clues"&gt;The earliest clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Old Paleolithic materials found at the site include sizable hand axes from a time when toolmaking was still in its infancy. These finds point to the Old (or Early) Paleolithic, a period roughly spanning 2.6 million to 300,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some artifacts might be as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/archaeologists-discovered-ancient-footprints-that-rewrite-the-story-of-humans-in-america/"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; as 1.5 million years, revealing a remarkable window into the behaviors of people who thrived long before many modern innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fieldwork was a huge success,” stated Egberts. Her focus on surface-level collection rather than deep digging allowed for quick exploration of the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the material was gathered, she organized a preliminary analysis to see how these objects were distributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-middle-paleolithic-techniques"&gt;Middle paleolithic techniques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between about 300,000 and 50,000 years ago, humans turned to a more structured style of toolmaking. &lt;a href="https://stonetoolsmuseum.com/artefact/europe/levallois-flake/2383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Levallois flakes&lt;/a&gt; are a classic example of this approach, which involves carefully shaping a stone core to produce specific flake forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists often interpret this systematic flaking method as evidence of advanced planning and mental organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early forms of this technique have surfaced in various parts of Southwest Asia, reflecting the spread of carefully prepared stone industries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach differs from the heftier and less refined hand axes that preceded them. Such shifts in design provide researchers with a glimpse into human progress across vast timelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-teaching-and-collaboration"&gt;Teaching and collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egberts led instructional sessions with Iraqi archaeology students, who gained first-hand experience handling Paleolithic items and analyzing the surrounding soils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three students joined the field activities to see how scientists record artifact positions and note subtle variations in sediment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workshops at &lt;a href="https://en.qu.edu.iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Al-Qadisiyah University&lt;/a&gt; covered the basics of measuring soil layers and interpreting the evidence of ancient streams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiastic participants discussed how preserving these sites enriches awareness of cultural heritage. Organizing community presentations helped invite broader interest, including visits to local schools, universities, and conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-life-on-the-ground"&gt;Life on the ground&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crews expected significant logistical hurdles, but they managed to cover the desert terrain without major interruptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendly interactions with residents smoothed the process, while checkpoints served as routine stops rather than obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project members observed that the openness of the region made surface scanning more straightforward than in areas with dense vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial backing came from the &lt;a href="https://www.bisi.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;British Institute for the Study of Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, which covered initial travel and research costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to collaborate with Iraqi authorities and students allowed scientists to expand their understanding of how early humans once roamed through a network of water sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-further-exploration-ahead"&gt;Further exploration ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egberts is assembling resources to keep examining how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/5000-year-old-fort-hidden-in-the-jungle-confirms-ancient-society-sophistication-lidar/"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; environments changed throughout the Pleistocene and how people adapted to these fluctuations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She intends to map other localities in the Western Desert, aiming to confirm whether the patterns spotted here mirror trends seen in other parts of Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More extensive artifact analysis will also help determine if there are unique signatures linked to certain groups. Drawing on laboratory tools to inspect each item’s shape and wear patterns may yield new angles on migration and cultural expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paleolithic-objects-identified-with-science"&gt;Paleolithic objects identified with science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining geology, archaeology, and advanced imaging techniques often highlights unseen details like micro-flake scars or residues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how sites endure in harsh conditions is vital. Researchers hope these fragile archaeological remains will remain protected so future investigators can tap into them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This broader perspective fosters more discussions on how heritage and conservation can unite communities and encourage appreciation for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-high-tech-machinery-used-to-build-egypt-step-pyramid-djoser-study-claims/"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt; cultural legacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egberts will keep weaving these observations into broader debates about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/115000-year-old-human-footprints-found-alathar-lake-arabian-peninsula/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; origins. She seeks to revisit this area of Iraq once funding is in place, aiming to piece together evidence of how shifting climates and varied landscapes influenced life over immense periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By coordinating with government bodies and local institutions, she hopes that ongoing discoveries will reinforce the significance of preserving remnants of the deep past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:48:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOX3BaQnJaM3JhSUpmaTlWb3N6aGRYUjF1ZkFaTWFWbjJLZzNjTFpsbERJZlFoRVkxVzdrWTJmVzQ3aFBGNXUyd2xlUkE1bnV2Sm5heGRfalV6emRvdnNCY1VrR2h0Nk9nUjdKQUw1a3NlT1pQbFdSM0s5TURUX2M0SUhDdURTZFFZTUJvUTJJeGZZY0VLdURJUS0yRQ</guid></item><item><title>一个生酮试验如何在营养世界引发一场新战争- WIRED | How One Keto Trial Set Off a New War in the Nutrition World - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZnJLZ3JGVmlxTzZQVXVFU0dDUXRXajNLTUx0YzZibmstNXpjZnZyRFdvdGpXWjZvQWhZbFA1U3c3bHpJRko2S2E1MnpTNjFHNllEYnhCQWd1aDRNRURkLS0zMmxDa2lFd2RVcThhYzloc2hvM0lFQl9VSU1mMUVzbUpxajUta0tFUTNlREdrOEZRbVZEblZGTHdwYmR5X3B6anNVZDJYWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the study was still in the recruitment phase, Nadolsky left the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Entrenched Positions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Klatt, of UC Berkeley, is extremely well-versed in nutrition research and the current online debates around cholesterol.

Klatt discussed the study with Nadolsky while it was ongoing, and many aspects concerned him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Klatt brought up issues of undisclosed biases to the Lundquist Institute, the host of the trial, along with Dave Feldman’s “strongly vested interest” in the results of the study that was not properly disclosed, claiming he was “a conflicted party with no training in the biomedical sciences.” His email to the Institute about these issues went unanswered. “I think this study has gotten to the point of being extremely unethical,” Klatt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“All authors adhered to the conflicts-of-interest disclosure guidelines the journal required,” Soto-Mata says. “Our study was independently reviewed, approved, and monitored by an expert Research Ethics committee, all its recommendations were followed, and all its standards were met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While some researchers and physicians are tearing the study apart, or using it to show that keto can have adverse effects, Klatt doesn’t draw any strong conclusions. “People are talking past each other,” he says. Generally speaking, there are two clear camps, with one thinking the traditional lipid hypothesis holds up, and another thinking the new lipid energy model might work. Klatt puts himself in a third camp, asking: “Why are we trying to interpret this study at all?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I’m an editor at the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,” Klatt says, “and I would like to believe that we would have rejected this outright without even sending it out for peer review, because it has so many obvious issues.” He is worried about people using this flawed study as proof the consensus on the risks of LDL cholesterol has been “debunked,” which it has not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One of the study’s coauthors, Matthew Budoff, a professor of medicine at UCLA as well as an investigator at the Lundquist Institute, acknowledged in an email to WIRED that there had been “incredible scrutiny of the data on social media, which is more than expected based on my prior publications.” He noted the research team is seeking to have the paper incorporate corrections, but that this is ultimately at the discretion of the journal. A response to the Letter to the Editor from the coauthors clarifies some of the issues, he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That reply to the Letter to the Editor &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862"}' href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.101862" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has now been published&lt;/a&gt;—and reveals that the study’s data may support the conventional position on the risk of cholesterol after all. The study’s authors share that the “pooled median change” in NCPV in the participants—the rise in the type of plaque the study was set up to investigate, but which originally wasn’t explicitly quantified in the paper—was an alarming 42.8 percent. The reply goes on to state that the study’s findings were “compatible with a causal role of ApoB in atherosclerosis”—the build-up of fat in the arteries—which they’ve “acknowledged and supported in previous publications.” The letter says that not mentioning this percentage increase in NCPV “was a sincere oversight, not intentional selective reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But this concession comes after the horse has bolted. Feldman’s hypothesis is already appearing in laypeople’s research—with the keto diet having been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9312449/"&gt;among the most Googled diets&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, and keto products a growing multibillion-dollar industry. Answering the query “What is special about Lean Mass Hyper-Responders,” ChatGPT provides the lipid energy model, Feldman’s argument against the consensus on cholesterol, among the initial explanations for why there is so much controversy and interest. There is also a &lt;em&gt;Cholesterol Code&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414"}' href="https://x.com/realDaveFeldman/status/1875961842885091414" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;documentary&lt;/a&gt; in the works—which covers Feldman’s personal experience and his research, including this study—which Feldman predicts will be available on a major streaming service sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:18:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZnJLZ3JGVmlxTzZQVXVFU0dDUXRXajNLTUx0YzZibmstNXpjZnZyRFdvdGpXWjZvQWhZbFA1U3c3bHpJRko2S2E1MnpTNjFHNllEYnhCQWd1aDRNRURkLS0zMmxDa2lFd2RVcThhYzloc2hvM0lFQl9VSU1mMUVzbUpxajUta0tFUTNlREdrOEZRbVZEblZGTHdwYmR5X3B6anNVZDJYWQ</guid></item><item><title>紧急健康警告，因为在美国购物中心检测到地球上最具传染性的疾病-每日邮报 | Urgent health warning as most contagious disease on Earth is detected at Mall of America - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An urgent warning has been issued following the discovery of world's most infectious disease at America's largest shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have revealed that a child who visited the Mall of America - which is about the size of 78 football fields - in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-e0dbf930-4096-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; on May 24 has tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unvaccinated child from Dakota County, who has not traveled outside of Minnesota in the last month, visited the mall's theme park and they were infectious at the time.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who were at the mall on May 24 between 5pm and 9pm may have been exposed as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772281/US-map-measles-MMR-vaccine-rate-study.html"&gt;The state's health department &lt;/a&gt;warned symptoms of measles - including a blotchy rash, fever and cough - could develop as late as June 14 in those who were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They highlight that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766243/cdc-americans-cancel-flights-worlds-infectious-disease-planes.html"&gt;unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; are most at risk and should watch for signs of the viral disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another case of measles has also been confirmed in Minnesota but it is not &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10924717/Measles-Minnesota-Child-hospitalized-second-isolating-home.html"&gt;said to be related.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This case involves a Washington County adult whose vaccination status is unverified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An urgent warning has been issued following the discovery of world's most infectious disease at America's largest shopping mall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual was exposed to the virus during domestic air travel outside of Minnesota and is currently recovering at home, as is the child who was infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These incidents bring Minnesota's confirmed measles cases up to four in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Minnesota Department of Health is now working with local health departments and other Twin Cities locations to contact those who were exposed to either case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jessica Hancock-Allen, the infectious disease division director at MDH, says the case detected at the Mall of America is particularly concerning as there is currently 'no known source'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: 'Anytime we confirm a case of measles unrelated to travel that has no known source it is worrying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is because it could be a sign that measles is spreading in the community undetected by public health and healthcare systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is uncertain where the child was exposed and whether others may have been exposed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Minnesota cases come as measles cases in the US &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6695579/More-100-cases-measles-confirmed-nationwide-outbreak-fueled-anti-vaxxers-CDC-says.html"&gt;continue to spike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently there have been 1,088 confirmed measles cases and at least three deaths reported by 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html"&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the MMR vaccine, which is 97 percent effective at stopping infections, measles is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:08:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>当心癌症幽灵-切割 | Beware the Cancer Ghosts - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQZ2RWaVNGN2xaLVVFYm9ER0syWks2Mnh6eV9NOGxJSkxHRkVueERZQ19OVVhzNDlfdmZHNjRHazVnSFdTSlkzQ0NPWHFRWmtkMXlpWjNCUkNUUmNpNUx3ZFNQMWhnRDRmR2IxcjBCWnNkaVJGcklQeFdCbzlKOGxXWVQtSElMUXZXNFI1bGN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content special-feature" data-editable="content"&gt;

People I considered very close might disappear altogether. They would be my “cancer ghosts.”&lt;/p&gt;

I had never known anyone my age with cancer or been close to someone going through treatment. How could I expect the people around me to know what to say or do when &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;didn’t even know? I had no idea how to talk to someone with cancer, which questions were okay to ask, what advice (if any) to solicit. If I were my friend, I wouldn’t know what to say to me, either.&lt;/p&gt;

That my connections after cancer would remain more or less the same as they had been before. But it didn’t work; the ghosts materialized anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

Naturally, that made me feel worse. But we talked it through and moved on. Then, after all my hair was gone, that friend began drifting into the background until they disappeared entirely. &lt;em&gt;Poof!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His partner, whom I loved. His family, whom I had grown up with. It’s been almost two years now and I haven’t heard from that friend since.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb850n45002o3b77lyo7quon@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;Somewhere along the drift, I’d asked, “Had I done something wrong? Was there a deep-rooted issue we needed to process together?” My ghost told me it was nothing like that. They admitted the timing wasn’t great — me being in chemo and all — but said they were focusing on themselves these days and needed to be selfish and set a boundary. “I don’t owe you an explanation,” they had said. That left no room for discussion. &lt;em&gt;Wasn’t I just a bridesmaid at your wedding? &lt;/em&gt;I thought anyway. &lt;em&gt;Why was I not owed an explanation? We’ve been friends since we were 12. Also, I am bald. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb850t0j002x3b77mp9q3z0l@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;In my pursuit for answers, I reached out to other survivors to ask if they had been through something similar, if they had an explanation, a theory, anything that could be the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I was looking for. It wasn’t long before their stories poured in — of course they did. As Kristie Redfield, a therapist specializing in oncology and cancer survivorship, points out, the fact that there’s a name for this particular type of friendship breakup “reflects its ubiquity. I hope people enduring cancer see the term as evidence that cancer ghosting is a phenomenon, not an isolated, personal failing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8511nc00363b77ob34bucv@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Emily, a young breast-cancer survivor, told me that while one of her best friends offered vague gestures of support, she never showed up in any substantial way. “I definitely made excuses for her absence, thinking that everyone handles things differently, and that I’m sure she had a reason she didn’t call or come visit,” Emily says of her ghost. Then, Emily’s chemo treatments kept her from attending her friend’s son’s birthday party. “Chemo symptoms come in cycles, and there are some days you feel great and some days you feel like crap,” she says. “I decided on one of the good days to plan a trip to Disneyland. This upset her because she didn’t understand why I could go to a theme park but not her son’s birthday party.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zi6g000i3b772w9u2cvz@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;Some friends &lt;em&gt;poof! &lt;/em&gt;even sooner, like right after a diagnosis. That’s what happened to Natasha, 37, a skin- and breast-cancer survivor who lost “a close co-worker, whom I considered a friend.” The sudden drop in communication, she says, particularly stung given that they had been frontline nurses together during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I was saddened by the experience,” she tells me, “because as nurses, we don’t leave our people behind, as we understand the intricacies of having an illness like this.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb851u5i003p3b773jw14p2w@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;My ghost had similarly seemingly vanished overnight. But more often, people didn’t leave with a bang. They became transparent so slowly that it was almost imperceptible, until one day, they were inexplicably gone. “The absence happened so gradually that I barely noticed at first: a missed text here, a canceled coffee there. Soon, a day became a week, a week became a month,” Trish, 35, says of a college friend who ghosted her as her breast-cancer treatment intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zi8b000k3b77ykd9z56s@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;The heartbreak of losing friends, co-workers, and childhood besties was widely felt among the women I spoke with, but another theme also emerged: the loss of casual connections. These were the mid-tier friendships; the people they grabbed drinks with, bumped into at parties, or shared spontaneous plans with. Because cancer often demands lifestyle shifts, like &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general.html"&gt;cutting back on alcohol due to its link with recurrence&lt;/a&gt;, those changes can reshape how, and with whom, we connect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zi9d000l3b77dj75ttht@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;Before her breast-cancer diagnosis, 37-year-old Julie worked at a restaurant where her social life revolved around the bar and nightlife scene. While her friends used to regularly invite her out to shows and parties, after cancer, the invites stopped coming. “I think we just never figured out anything else to do together after that, since I was trying to keep drinking to a minimum,” she says. “And, honestly, it feels a little lazy, because you can absolutely find things to do with people that don’t involve drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84ziav000m3b773jmvqmjj@published" data-word-count="36"&gt;Or, as Trish puts it, “Was my value tied solely to my ability to meet for mimosas or dance until dawn? Was my breast cancer simply ‘not a vibe’ for [my ghost’s] carefully curated social calendar?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zic7000n3b77ckoeodgp@published" data-word-count="122"&gt;Perhaps some of these friendships simply were not what they seemed to be in the first place. Caroline, 43, now suspects that the bond between her and her ghost was never really there. She and her then-friend had bonded quickly after she had moved to the neighborhood. Caroline says their dynamic developed into “the kind of besties usually reserved for friendships forged in childhood, someone you’ve known forever.” For close to a year, they spoke multiple times a day, watched each other’s kids, and spent time with each other’s parents. They leaned on one another in emergencies. “We couldn’t believe how much we had in common and how similar we viewed the world,” says Caroline. But then Caroline was diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852aep00483b77ixzu9e1e@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;Her friend showed up just in time for the photo ops, wearing “Team Caroline” shirts and posting supportive selfies on social media. But once Caroline’s breast-cancer treatment ended and the cameras were gone, her friend also disappeared. To Caroline, this was simply a performance of morality rather than authentic friendship: “A good word to describe how the whole experience made me feel is &lt;em&gt;disposable&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852c95004h3b779ukf5mlr@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;When I asked Redfield why she believes cancer ghosting happens, she offered a few ideas. “It’s possible a person ghosts because they don’t know what to say or do, or they worry that what they can offer is inadequate,” she explains. “It’s also possible that a person ghosts because of fears of their own fragility and mortality — &lt;em&gt;If you can get cancer, I can get cancer &lt;/em&gt;— which may be especially pronounced when young people are diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852gzw004q3b77uwl0etge@published" data-word-count="161"&gt;Asha, 41, believes “it happens when people confuse their discomfort with your pain as a reason to disappear.” Natasha thinks that some people may simply not have the space to take it on: “Maybe she just did not have the capacity to be in the ‘dark’ with me. Maybe it was just too close to home for her and she couldn’t tolerate bad news.” Or maybe it’s because people are just bad at engaging in tough situations. “Society rarely equips us with tools for these difficult conversations, and my friend’s inability to face my illness created a chasm too wide to cross,” says Trish. Redfield suspects that our struggle to meaningfully engage in tough situations may stem from a cultural discomfort with openly discussing illness and death. “Showing up for another requires recognition of shared humanity and vulnerability, which many of us are encouraged to avoid in our day-to-day lives,” she says. “We might lack practice or not see it as a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852p6e004z3b778cmnn5vx@published" data-word-count="69"&gt;I worry I have cancer ghosts because cancer has changed me &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much — that it’s made me harder to relate to, that I’ve drifted too far from the person I used to be, and that I may never fully find my way back. I skip restaurant dates because I’m not gainfully employed. Like Trish and Julie, I can’t go out drinking with my friends like I could before.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb8531xv005h3b773it4ties@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;“Finishing treatment was, in some ways, the hardest part,” Julie told me, and I knew just what she meant. We spoke about how being in active treatment (surgery, chemo, and radiation) was like having a visible disability, which made it easier in some ways. Our missing hair and eyebrows were visual markers so universally understood that even strangers gave us that hand-over-heart gesture of “knowing” we must really be going through &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. There was a level of compassion and understanding built in without us having to explain anything at all. There was community and people ready to surround us, no questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb852zzi00583b77iy44awz7@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;But once the hair grew back and people congratulated us for being done, they left. We were far from “done,” though. For young women like Julie and me, breast-cancer treatment involved being put into medically induced menopause for five to ten years, a jarring reality nobody had prepared us for. And unlike a highly visible bald head, our menopause symptoms were invisible, so we were left to navigate that part of the journey alone. While my friends are beginning to build their families, debating whether or not they should have kids, my reality feels worlds apart. My biggest question isn’t if I want children — it’s whether the few eggs I managed to freeze before chemotherapy could become viable embryos.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853927005q3b77c82spees@published" data-word-count="114"&gt;I had tried to keep my bar low, thinking if I didn’t change too much, my friendships wouldn’t either. In fact, sometimes I worry that cancer didn’t change me enough — that I didn’t walk away with the profound life lessons I was supposed to, that I didn’t learn to love my body the way facing mortality &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have taught me to. Why am I still so obsessed with my weight? Why am I still just as frugal as I was before, hesitating to burn a gifted candle because it feels like burning money? Shouldn’t I have learned to &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; a little? But even while I do feel fundamentally the same, I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; different.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb84zidv000o3b77hr78ymyy@published" data-word-count="147"&gt;I now know what it’s like to face my mortality, to make impossibly difficult decisions about my body, to advocate for myself as a patient, and to navigate complex medical and insurance systems. I’ve learned just how much support and care matter during such times. I’ve also come to realize that, maybe, there were &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; going to be some people in my life who could not hold space for me in my most vulnerable moments, regardless of the height of my bar. “If someone disappears from your life because you have cancer, it speaks to their capacity, not your worthiness,” assures Redfield.&lt;br&gt;The loss of close friendships during cancer is difficult to reconcile, and I might never have clear answers as to why it happened to me. All I can do is shift my perspective to highlight the good, because there really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a whole lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853fyw005z3b77simsq52g@published" data-word-count="165"&gt;There are the cancer ghosts, but there are also angels. Of course, there were friends and family who never wavered before, during, and after, and those connections have only strengthened and deepened over time. But there were also people I never would have predicted would become my pillars, who came to my side in ways that humble me still. I formed unexpected bonds with so many people, like some of my friends’ mothers — women in a more common age bracket to have gone through breast cancer and menopause themselves. Like my tax guy’s mom, for example. I was doing taxes the same week I was diagnosed, and he offered to introduce me to his mother, a breast-cancer survivor. Karen and I talked on the phone almost every day for a year despite our 30-plus-year age difference and having never met in person. These women understood me in a way few others could, and they now make up a part of my new community post-cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853m0t00683b77f7xt1xsv@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;Now, nearly two years out from active treatment, I look at my community with a complicated kind of gratitude. The ghosts remain — some I still grieve, some I’ve made peace with — but they no longer haunt me or overshadow the ones who stayed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853stf006h3b77y3509hqr@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;Trish now calls cancer the “ultimate friendship filter,” separating those who could sit with discomfort from those who fled from it. Her own cancer ghost “felt like another amputation alongside my surgery,” she says. “But it cleared space in my life that has since filled with people whose compassion runs deeper than convenience.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853ubk006q3b77fd8n4ahq@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;I know what she means. Cancer can force a reckoning that’s not easy for anybody, and those left standing with us till the end know that well.&lt;br&gt;I’ve lived through challenges most people avoid talking about or only encounter much later in life: menopause, infertility, a changing body, the loss of libido, the loss of health. We all will eventually face these things in one form or another; I just happened to confront them much earlier than expected. It has not only helped me develop a deeper, more expansive understanding of what it means to be human, but to appreciate the depth of support we will all one day need at some point in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb853yxt006z3b77ai7eqrkb@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;I would still warn anybody going through it, whatever their “it” may be, to &lt;em&gt;beware the ghosts&lt;/em&gt;. But I would also tell them to, more importantly, look out for the living who are still around. Because, in the end, a natural kind of rebalancing tends to unfold when unexpected people step up in the place of those who left. It’s what keeps us moving forward — and, sometimes, that can mean everything.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. has been a vocal opponent of mRNA technologies, which &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21898-mrna-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;teach bodies &lt;/a&gt;to ward off infectious diseases by making a tiny part of a virus so immune systems can learn how to destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terminating CHAVD is part of broader Trump administration cuts to HIV vaccine research. In an emailed statement Tuesday, an HHS spokesperson said the agency has been supporting “duplicative health programs,” including 27 programs addressing HIV and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue under the Administration for a Healthy America (AHA),” the spokesperson wrote. “We must end this wasteful and inefficient model of health programming in favor of strategic, coordinated approaches. The creation of AHA does not eliminate priorities or functions; instead, it unites previously independent programs to work together to Make America Healthy Again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;June 4, 2025 at 6:30 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

This poses a significant danger for those who like to eat freshly caught freshwater fish. But there are ways to protect yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The parasites are called trematodes. Two species of the flatworms were discovered in California’s freshwater fish, according to a study published Tuesday in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf180/8154770?login=false" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;. The tiny, flattened and sluglike creatures can cause gastrointestinal problems, weight loss and lethargy when a person eats an infected fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some rare and severe cases, the parasites have caused strokes or heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Americans don’t usually think about parasites when they eat freshwater fish because it hasn’t historically been an issue here,” said Ryan Hechinger, the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact,  even when a person has fallen ill from a locally caught infected freshwater fish, their healthcare provider will typically ask if the patient has recently traveled outside of the United States, Hechinger said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="california-wasnt-this-parasites-first-home" class="subhead"&gt;California wasn’t this parasite’s first home&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified two species of trematode: &lt;i&gt;Haplorchis pumilio&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Centrocestus formosanus&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two parasite species have historically infected people in Southeast Asia who &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/foodborne-trematode-infections#:~:text=People%20become%20infected%20by%20eating,severe%20liver%20and%20lung%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;eat raw fish, crustaceans or vegetables&lt;/a&gt; that carry the parasite larvae. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trematode has a very specific life cycle, leeching onto three hosts that include a freshwater snail, a fish and then a bird or human who ate the infected fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite was probably carried to the U.S. by the red-rimmed melania, or Malaysian trumpet snail, which is host to a number of parasitic species and was introduced to the United States, Hechinger estimates, decades ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It inhabits “freshwater springs, streams, lakes and swamps,” according to the &lt;a class="link" href="https://invasions.si.edu/nemesis/species_summary/71533" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Environmental Research Center,&lt;/a&gt; but can occasionally be found in “brackish and marine habitats, especially mangroves” (think the Everglades). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snail first popped up in California in 1972 in a Riverside County ditch, according to the center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hechinger, through &lt;a class="link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/227/2/183/6754904?login=false#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; and new research, found that the snail and its associated trematode parasites can be widely found in lakes and reservoirs across the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s identified the snails in Los Angeles, Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="some-fish-harbor-thousands-of-parasites" class="subhead"&gt;Some fish harbor thousands of parasites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summer and fall 2023, researchers, with the help of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, analyzed fresh fish that were collected at five fishing localities in San Diego County: Miramar, Murray, Lower Otay and San Vicente reservoirs as well as Chollas Lake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fish included largemouth bass and bluegill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hechinger and his team found that 93% of all the fish in the study were infected with the &lt;i&gt;H. pumilio&lt;/i&gt; parasite, with some individual fish harboring thousands of the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second parasite, &lt;i&gt;C. formosanus&lt;/i&gt;, was found at two of the five locations, where it occurred in 91% of the fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

Stock image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating fat before the carbohydrates didn't lower the blood sugar spike but did delay it from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This suggests that eating fibre-rich foods like vegetables, and proteins like eggs before tucking into carbohydrates could prevent rocketing blood sugar that leads to a hunger-inducing crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Michael Snyder, an expert in genetics author of the study, said diners should try to eat their meals in a specific order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eating carbohydrates later in a meal is still a good idea even though it has not yet been sorted out whether it is best to eat protein, fat or fibre before carbohydrates,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eat your salad or hamburger before your French fries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also noted that the impact of fibre, protein and fat on blood sugar levels was less significant among participants with signs of pre-diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors, who published their findings in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1085535?"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, said this was an area in need of further research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carbohydrates, a group that includes rice, potatoes, bread and pasta, are energy dense foods that are quickly converted to sugar in our blood, giving us the resources we need to function.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says carbohydrates should make up about a third of a person's daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials urge people to eat wholegrain varieties like brown bread or potatoes with the skin on as these come with higher levels of fibre and nutrients, and can slow the release of sugar in our bloodstream, maintaining fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost 6million Britons have diabetes, of which 90 per cent is type 2, but charities estimate 1.2million are living with the disease undiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While nationally, an estimated eight per cent of the population of England has the disease, this rises to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14472619/The-diabetes-capital-10-cent-suffer-condition-health-experts-warn-sign-worsening-obesity-crisis.html"&gt;over one in 10 people in some parts of the country&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn't make enough insulin or the insulin it makes doesn't work properly. Insulin is a hormone critical to controlling blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having high blood sugar levels over time can cause heart attacks and strokes, as well as problems with the eyes, kidneys and feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sufferers may need to overhaul their diet, take daily medication and have regular check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of the condition, which is diagnosed with a blood test, include excessive thirst, tiredness and needing to urinate more often.

								&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Julie moved to Massachusetts to start a new job in biotech. She was maintaining her relationship with her partner long distance, and starting a new position in an unknown city alone had her distressed. Her psychologist and doctor recommended she start taking the antidepressant &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/05/23/decades-on-ssris-remain-mired-in-mystery-and-debate_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;Prozac&lt;/a&gt; (fluoxetine) to feel better, and it helped her function — for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then years went by, and she started to develop other symptoms. Her &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/insomnia" target="_blank"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; got worse. She felt oddly detached from herself and she started to have thoughts about suicide that she had not had before. During this time, she was processing traumatic experiences from her childhood in therapy, but she felt like these symptoms were being exacerbated by Prozac. So in 2022, Julie started tapering off of her medication after talking with her primary care doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just continued taking it, sort of without questioning,” Julie, who is using a pseudonym to protect her privacy, told Salon in a phone interview. “I came to believe that Prozac was causing more problems than it was helping.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants like Prozac were a major breakthrough in psychiatry when they were first marketed in the 1980s. However, their use has become so widespread in the U.S. that some argue they are now being overprescribed. In fact, an entire internet subculture has developed to help people get off of their antidepressants, which doctors warn can be dangerous if not performed under the medical supervision of a health care provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; issued in February, President Donald Trump said the administration would “assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,” referring to SSRIs, a common class of antidepressants and other psychiatric medications. During his testimony at the Senate Finance Committee, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also said that antidepressants were &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3O4z_UbxlY"&gt;harder to get off than heroin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the same time we have people overtreated, we also have people who are untreated."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can be &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/06/hey-lets-not-get-carried-away-anti-depressants-really-do-help-people/257976/"&gt;life-saving&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/i-was-wary-of-antidepressants-but-they-helped-when-nothing-else-could"&gt;life-enhancing&lt;/a&gt; for many people, but for most people with mild or moderate forms of depression they are not intended for long-term use. The drugs can also carry side effects that can significantly impact a person’s quality of life, including weight gain, sexual dysfunction and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28628765/"&gt;emotional blunting&lt;/a&gt;, in which people feel fewer positive emotions along with negative ones. While Kennedy is wrong — antidepressants are not harder to stop using than heroin — the withdrawal process can come with its own side effects as well, which some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/antidepressant-withdrawal-symptoms-doctors-side-effects"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; is an underrecognized problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are very individualized things,” said Dr. Mark Olfson, a psychiatrist at Columbia University. “There is no one-size-fits-all in terms of how people make trade offs between the burdens of staying on the medication versus the protection the medication offers some individuals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most commonly used antidepressants today are SSRIs like Prozac, which came on the market in 1988. In the decades that followed, the prevalence of SSRI prescriptions continued to increase year over year to a climax in the pandemic when the proportion of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health-care.htm"&gt;U.S. population taking antidepressants approached 25%&lt;/a&gt;. This more than &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3162179/"&gt;tripled the proportion of people on them in 1990&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression has also increased over the years, or at least has been detected in more people. Yet the proportion of the population with depression remains lower than the proportion on antidepressants, in part because these medications are also commonly prescribed for other conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, insomnia and anxiety — which has also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905958/"&gt;increased in the U.S. in recent decades&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some believe they are inappropriately prescribed for too long, or in cases when lifestyle changes or psychotherapy should be tried first. However, many people with depression and severe anxiety who could benefit with antidepressants are also not getting the help they need, Olfson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do think there was and maybe still is overprescription,” he told Salon in a phone interview. “But at the same time we have people overtreated, we also have people who are untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although antidepressant use is still on the rise, a &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20240492"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; Olfson co-authored last month found that, for the first time since these drugs were introduced, the use of psychotherapy increased at a higher rate than medication alone. This may in part be due to the increased availability of telehealth counseling, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's still the case that most people with depression or anxiety who receive treatment receive antidepressants, but in the last few years, a rising proportion of them are receiving psychotherapy and the growth of psychotherapy has occurred more quickly than the growth of antidepressants,” Olfson said. “This change is coming after years and years of medications just sort of dominating mental health care in America.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, psychotherapy remains steeped in stigma and inaccessible to many. This may be one reason that antidepressants are prescribed when other strategies could work as well. Sometimes a person’s only point of contact with a medical professional who could help them with depression is their family doctor, who could refer them to a psychologist. But if they are not available or too expensive, patients are left with few options other than antidepressants, explained Dr. Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist at Case Western Reserve University, who said we often end up using antidepressants “as a matter of structural convenience."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, if you look at the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/depression-guideline/guideline.pdf"&gt;practice guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, they recommend that for mild to moderate depression, it is better to start with psychotherapy and lifestyle change and reserve antidepressants for cases of mild to moderate depression that are not getting better or those of more severe intensity,” Aftab told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julie struggled to find an affordable psychiatrist in her area that could help guide her through the process of getting on antidepressants back in 2017. Her primary care doctor ended up overseeing her prescription, but once she got on Prozac, they didn’t really discuss it anymore, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aftab said this can happen often: “They just put people on antidepressants and then they kind of forget about it and it just keeps getting refilled,” he said. Then, the discussion about whether the medication is working or if they need to stay on it "doesn't really happen,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem with staying on antidepressants longer than necessary is that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39394455/"&gt;withdrawal symptoms can be more difficult the longer you stay on them&lt;/a&gt;. If someone is stopping antidepressants, it's recommended to wean off them slowly and under medical supervision because doing so too quickly and without the right dosage can be dangerous. It can lead to side effects such as a symptom called "brain zap" in which patients feel sudden shocks in their head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on a range of factors including the dosage and medication, it can take months or more. Julie did it in eight weeks, but she experienced symptoms that were worse than the original depression she felt, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My biggest symptom after that was extreme anhedonia, like a feeling of not being myself or getting pleasure from anything — almost not feeling human,” she said. “Along with extreme physical fatigue, both of those symptoms lasted for about two years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The evidence for the serotonin theory of depression was weak and inconsistent but the general public thought it wasn't just a theory."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the withdrawal from antidepressants can be mistaken for the return of the original depression it was intended to treat. This could lead some people to go back on medication, if the feeling is so uncomfortable that being on the medication ends up providing relief, Aftab said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there is &lt;a href="https://karger.com/pps/article/94/1/3/916620/Hidden-Costs-The-Clinical-and-Research-Pitfalls-of"&gt;relatively limited research&lt;/a&gt; exploring the right protocol to get off of antidepressants and how to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal, Aftab said. There is even still much debate about what causes depression in the first place. In 1967, an English psychiatrist named Alec Coppen proposed the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0"&gt;“serotonin theory,”&lt;/a&gt; suggesting a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain caused depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the pharmaceutical industry developed Prozac, the first SSRI. However, in the decades that followed, some &lt;a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/exploring-the-star-d-controversy" target="_blank"&gt;questions were raised about the trials&lt;/a&gt; used to demonstrate the effectiveness of SSRIs. Around the same time, researchers started to question the serotonin theory that had been publicized as a potential cause of depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanna Moncrieff, a professor of critical and social psychiatry at University College London, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01661-0"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in Nature in 2022 that concluded there was “no consistent evidence of there being an association between serotonin and depression.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We can’t conclude that depression is related to serotonin abnormality,” Moncrieff told Salon in a phone interview. “The evidence for the serotonin theory of depression was weak and inconsistent but the general public thought it wasn't just a theory: They thought it was an established scientific fact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moncrieff’s paper received significant backlash, with five responses published in the journal along with a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02095-y"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; authored by 35 academics that challenged Moncreiff’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that the cause of depression is far more complex than something operating on a single neurotransmitter like serotonin, said Philip Cowen, a professor of psychopharmacology at the University of Oxford and one of the co-authors on the comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, that doesn't mean these drugs don't help people. For one, it's common for medications to not target the direct cause of illness. Instead, many are designed to alleviate symptoms and suffering, Cowen explained. For example, asthma inhalers activate receptors, which relax the airways to help facilitate breathing. This helps with asthma symptoms but does not treat the direct cause of asthma, which is ultimately an allergic reaction. A similar thing may be happening with antidepressants, Cowen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The serotonin theory] is a simplistic view and it can't be right,” Cowen told Salon in a phone interview. “Taking SSRIs might make you feel better for various psychological reasons, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's working on a fundamental problem with serotonin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these medicines are still not fully understood, the fact remains that antidepressants do help many people feel better. Yet the back and forth within the medical community about the efficacy of antidepressants and the cause of depression might be &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-the-constant-trashing-of-antidepressants-is-absurd" target="_blank"&gt;why some have grown to mistrust them&lt;/a&gt;. Other &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/08/antidepressants-addictive-has-been-debunked-psychiatry-depression-withhdrawal-symptoms"&gt;false claims in the media and some scientific papers&lt;/a&gt; have stated that antidepressants can be addictive like alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add on misleading criticisms from the White House, and more people are likely to get off of them, said Rifaat El-Mallakh, a psychiatrist who leads the Mood Disorders Research Program at the University of Louisville Depression Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have your leaders saying things like, 'it's harder to get off an antidepressant than it is to get off heroin,' you say, ‘Oh my god, I better get off now before I'm stuck on this forever,’” El-Mallakh told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As distrust grows and it remains challenging for many people to access psychotherapy or medical treatment, many are seeking advice online. In fact, there is an entire &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/health/laura-delano-psychiatric-meds.html"&gt;subculture online&lt;/a&gt; where people talk about getting off of their psychiatric medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Julie did talk with her primary care doctor about getting off her medication, she felt there were more resources on the internet, she said. As she explained: “Most of the support I got through that process was just through online forums.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the difficulty of the withdrawal process, Julie has been tempted to go back on them again during challenging parts of her life. If she is ever in a place where she feels like her own safety is threatened by her mental health, she would consider it, she said. At the same time, she questions whether she actually needed them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wish we had a different culture in the medical care community around recommending antidepressants,” she said. “If they were treated more as a last resort, then maybe I would have made a different choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Julie feels more stable these days and developed strategies in the process of the antidepressant withdrawal that help her move through challenging moments, she said. Some of her symptoms, like problems with her libido, have not fully recovered. But she has started exercising again and feels like her body is more responsive to lifestyle changes she implements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think getting better is now a bit more under my control,” she said. “So there is potential for things to keep improving.”&lt;/p&gt;

Seminole’s outbreak didn’t deter the group, which &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1892697323580592382" target="_blank"&gt;wrongly&lt;/a&gt; suggested it had been caused by a local vaccination campaign and then &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1894036984814883242" target="_blank"&gt;floated other&lt;/a&gt; contradictory theories: that the vaccines were failing, shedding the measles virus, or perhaps working too well, leading somehow to a super virulent strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Myrick watched her neighbors repeat these distortions in a local Facebook group, “Seminole TX Residents NEED to KNOW,” sometimes naming her directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Every doctor that pushes the jabs gets commission from the big Pharma,” one woman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In late February, the Gaines County library posted a flyer “kindly” asking that unvaccinated and measles-sick patrons not come in.

The two epidemiologists Holbrooks had on staff were immediately overwhelmed by case investigations. Holbrooks also didn’t have outreach materials in Low German or a relationship with the Mennonite community, which he now urgently needed a way into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He turned to the state, which brought in nurses, testing supplies and vaccines. He set up a vaccine and testing clinic outside Seminole Hospital District; a spray-painted arrow on unfinished plywood signaled where to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQTkZhclNBRFVWU3lzTGV3STFVVV9DRGJENzVhQ3k4SnZnbWs2bm9FY2puSFlsMVo2OXFXTGZkbS1NakxWci1ZbVFmdjBQVWNTenFqV1VueFdVR1kxMWdraTVqVGJPMFdPbG1Ed1VOSDJIaDBaTzdvckNxTElDczk0QXBaNi1EU0lrVzM4cWtRbEhLODhDLUdvSWQ1ZEJlZlFvb2oxeXNfONIBVkFVX3lxTFB4V1dON2V1Q3Z6aFp2UmV6Z3ViWnhVUXV1ZjdJTXA0UHRlMEtkT1NYd1JKR0JfLThXekRkVE8zOHpfNFZRZG1DdFE0d0tBeFNJRXVNa0RR</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现有前途的新型阿尔茨海默氏症治疗方法- SciTechDaily | Scientists Discover Promising New Alzheimer’s Treatment - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOdk1VZ254bjAycUVXeVpBMTBwUXdWWmxYcGZrbzFxQ2ZQelJXNzdDSmIxQng5YjN3MVQ1cGFTNWVDM2dMUjJTbDhfOV80SlMtSmZBTzc1ZFpWeTQzc05FVm0wZ2liV25DS2QxSXdhRzNyU3d3c2RDcG9VeGNDT0UySlZIaVpOTW8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 08:41:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOdk1VZ254bjAycUVXeVpBMTBwUXdWWmxYcGZrbzFxQ2ZQelJXNzdDSmIxQng5YjN3MVQ1cGFTNWVDM2dMUjJTbDhfOV80SlMtSmZBTzc1ZFpWeTQzc05FVm0wZ2liV25DS2QxSXdhRzNyU3d3c2RDcG9VeGNDT0UySlZIaVpOTW8</guid></item><item><title>为什么随着年龄的增长，宿醉会更加严重，你能做些什么？ -每日野兽 | Why Do Hangovers Hit Harder as You Age—and What Can You Do About It? - The Daily Beast</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOX1Z2SjFYbEJrNXRlX0hDUnpFeENCSHZfMXgtQVg0cUMteFZJWDBzVncyT0ZjWHZ3SURxMU03VDlhN2hER255NXBsTTFPUHQ3dF9VdExDci03OGlObUFSdjlCLTdzaDI2azRJeDZGZVV3cUNVWG5feV9ybTVtaU1YUFh4Qm9td01ScUJmTmxkUTdtRkdJVU85SVEyWnVZZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body class="container story-layout-standard-tdb" id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;a class="skip-main" href="#main"&gt;Skip to Main Content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="use-svg"&gt;&lt;symbol id="youtube-icon" viewbox="0 0 37 37

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services’ &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2026-budget-in-brief.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;budget for 2026&lt;/a&gt;, released Friday, proposed $14 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/kennedy-maha-commission-report-chronic-disease-new-data-how-to-prioritize/"&gt;chronic disease epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, but it would also abolish the CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If this center is eliminated, state and local departments lose core prevention funds. And they lose the workforce for schools, chronic disease prevention, data collection, surveillance systems,” a senior official at the CDC chronic disease center told STAT on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. “If folks care about kids, schools rely on this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Federal health leaders want to fold the chronic disease center into the Administration for a Healthy America, a new entity within HHS that will also bring other centers under its umbrella: the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The proposal asserts these moves will strengthen the response to chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“AHA will administer $14.0 billion in discretionary funding for programs that aim to reverse the chronic disease epidemic,” the proposal reads. “It will prioritize prevention — a missing piece in the American health system — primary care, maternal and child health, mental health, substance use prevention and treatment, environmental health, HIV/AIDS, workforce development, and policy, research, and oversight.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;That leaves the current chronic disease center in limbo, its budget diminished, its &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/"&gt;workforce&lt;/a&gt; disbanded by &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/11/hhs-layoffs-analysis-health-impact-nih-cuts-cdc-rif-fda-reduction-in-force/"&gt;layoffs&lt;/a&gt; contested in court, and its location to be determined as its surviving programs are scattered. The president’s funding requests tend to undergo big changes before Congress passes a budget, but for now, public health experts are expressing puzzlement about how this proposal might harmonize with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/22/rfk-jr-maha-commission-report-key-takeaways-ultraprocessed-foods-environmental-toxins-overmedicalization/"&gt;Make America Healthy Again agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It looks pretty devastating for chronic disease when they’re saying that they’re really interested in prioritizing chronic disease,” Philip Huang, a physician and director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, told STAT. “And then that MAHA report that came out — I mean, it’s a very limited agenda that they’re talking about in terms of how to address chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving prevention to AHA may give rise to more problems than it solves, Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told STAT. Part of that is uncertainty about which programs may survive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That other agency does not exist right now,” she said. “You’re not just shifting the work. That would be something that has to get built up. So we’re losing the people who do the work right now. We don’t really know where the programs would pop up again when, and who will do the work.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson from HHS defended the decision, saying complex, duplicative health programs have led to fragmented efforts that dilute taxpayer resources and their impact on Americans. Some CDC programs will continue under AHA, the message emailed Tuesday also said, adding, “We must end this wasteful and inefficient model of health programming in favor of strategic, coordinated approaches. The creation of AHA does not eliminate priorities or functions; instead, it unites previously independent programs to work together to Make America Healthy Again.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not visible on the AHA agenda: the CDC’s program to encourage smoking cessation, which has already &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/14/cdc-closing-office-smoking-health-called-gift-to-big-tobacco-by-former-osh-director/"&gt;fallen to the budget ax&lt;/a&gt;, a decision that makes no sense to Huang, who, years ago in his role as chronic disease director for Texas, traveled the state to urge restaurants to go smoke-free. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For them to have eliminated the Office on Smoking and Health is absolutely insane if you say you’re trying to address chronic disease,” he said. Among preventable causes of chronic disease, “tobacco is the most blatant.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC official also called smoking cessation one of public health’s most effective interventions, “like smallpox elimination for chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new generation of young people, exposed to pitches selling e-cigarettes and tobacco pouches, might hear messages only from advertisers and not campaigns foundational to preventing heart disease, stroke, and cancer, the CDC official added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huang was struck by Kennedy’s answer when asked to name the leading preventable cause of death among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What he’s saying are the primary drivers of chronic disease are ultra-processed foods, environmental toxins, technology, and medications, including vaccines,” Huang said. “They may be factors, but we know a lot of what causes these chronic diseases. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of disease, and he couldn’t even identify that during his hearing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conservative voices have been &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/11/cdc-dismantle-trump-administration-00146035" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calling for the CDC&lt;/a&gt; to return to its roots, narrowing its scope to infectious diseases like the one that inspired its creation and its location in the southeastern United States: malaria.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1946, the CDC’s expertise and activities have grown deeper and wider, as the “prevention” in its name implies, to include a multitude of diseases, studying their origin, treatment, prevention, and prevalence. The agency’s knowledge, standards, and investigations are shared around the world and in all U.S. states and territories.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list of noncommunicable diseases is long, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, maternal mortality, obesity, mental illness, epilepsy, and dementia. So is the tally of causes in addition to tobacco: high blood pressure, unhealthy diet, limited physical activity, poor access to cancer screening. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the CDC’s footprint shrinks to communicable disease outbreaks, the chronic disease center’s program will be splintered. The pain would be felt far from headquarters in Atlanta, the CDC official said. That’s because 80% of the dollars funding the center at CDC now flow to state, territorial, and local health departments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prevention as a whole is being deprioritized, so that will put pressure on clinics in the health care delivery system to do what they’re not doing now: prevention outside the clinic, in neighborhoods, to prevent heart disease, diabetes, cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The budget plan would provide $500 million “to tackle priority activities to Make America Healthy Again,” of which $260 million would fight chronic illness by addressing nutrition and environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That would include $119 million for a new Prevention Innovation Program, which the proposal said would improve the health of Americans through reliable broadband technology integration, “ensuring access to nutrition services and physical activity venues, and reducing dependence on medication.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A May 22 &lt;a href="https://www.warnock.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FY26-CDC-Approps-Letter-_Final-Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;letter from 29 U.S. senators&lt;/a&gt; in response to President Trump’s budget proposal urged lawmakers to protect robust funding for the CDC as a whole while singling out its chronic disease center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The elimination of the CDC’s chronic disease prevention office also contradicts the Administration’s stated goal of addressing the chronic disease epidemic in our country,” the letter said. “These cuts will not make Americans healthy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the national center’s major roles is to provide the comprehensive data collection and analysis to public health departments across the country, a division of labor that allows small staffs to do more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jason Orcena, public health commissioner for Union County, Ohio, said there’s a valuable synergy between the CDC and his office, which serves 70,000 people in a county that includes both suburban and rural areas with differing health needs. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“There’s a heavy reliance on those national surveillance tools to help frame the work we do locally as part of our local community health assessments and community health improvement plan,” he said. “That’s one of the things the center and CDC in general does and the state does as well. We rely on them through that economy of scale to have truly experts in these areas because I can’t afford to have someone be an expert in all things.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked what disease or condition concerns him the most, Orcena said, “the one I don’t know about yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, pointed out that there are 3,300 departments across the country, some with hundreds of employees and some with just two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re the gap filler for people to make sure that even within the traditional medical system, things don’t fall through the cracks,” he said about individual public health systems. “If you start seeing a new cancer developing, that’s going to be picked up by the chronic disease center.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Case in point: HIV was initially recognized after a rare cancer related to the infection began showing up in men who had sex with men, later linked to the disease that became an epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the division that’s going to figure that out. It’s not NIH,” Benjamin said about the chronic disease center at CDC. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the state and local level, public health officials are facing confusing messages on funding for individual projects. Earlier this year they weathered the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/hhs-layoffs-local-officials-react-rif-impacts-public-health/"&gt;loss of money to pay for Covid-19 programs,&lt;/a&gt; many of which had pivoted to cover health needs beyond Covid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because chronic disease has long been underfunded and underappreciated, partnerships between local health departments and a national system is crucial, NACCHO’s Casalotti said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Bringing all these parts together could move us towards a place so we can focus more on these diseases,” she said. “Right now, what they’re seeing and experiencing is actually pulling back from this work, not necessarily pushing it forward. And so I think that’s where the field needs to go: We need to be pushing forward together.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

But I still do it. Quite a bit, actually. I can quickly get lost in thought while vacuuming or walking to the grocery store, and those thoughts can lead to new ideas or weird musings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Sometimes, I miss my subway stop. But on the whole, daydreaming &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/well/mind/daydreaming-benefits-brain.html"&gt;is a positive thing&lt;/a&gt;, a portal to more happiness and innovative thinking. We could probably be getting more out of it, though, said Madeleine Gross, a research scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies curiosity and creativity. “Our minds wander for a substantial portion of the day, and we’re often passive passengers,” she said. “That feels like a missed opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;People who are inherently creative &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10400419.2022.2120286?src=recsys"&gt;tend to daydream more&lt;/a&gt;. Higher rates of daydreaming go hand in hand with performing well on divergent thinking tasks, Dr. Gross said. (Remember the circle activity from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/well/creativity-drawing-art.html"&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;But it works both ways. “Daydreaming can also make you more creative,” she said. The key is following a few rules. That might sound nuts — it’s daydreaming! — but think about how often your mind wanders right to your stressful to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Dr. Gross encourages what she calls “intentional daydreaming,” which is nothing more than doing it purposefully, with a few preparations to set you up for success. In the best-case scenario, it can lead to a eureka moment that gets you past a sticking point in your life or work. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00215/full"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that taking time away from a problem to let your thoughts “incubate” in the background can prompt surprising solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;But more broadly, intentional daydreaming helps to make you more curious. “Curious people tend to enjoy their daydreaming more,” she said. “They have more engaging, more meaningful and more novel thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-wbgwfj"&gt;Ready for your next exercise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-dk6paf g-needs-margin-block"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 02:35:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOOVY3RG9qMW9WcXRGTTF0OWp6a3JqM1hId0p6SnV3bG5vekVYTzBVMm1RalhWN09STnJ0YXU0YWhLLTVpOHBYbXZHc0dGeU1fcEY3dG5LVE9ocEN1VGFzeVR4XzROcm8wd2M1VmdseTQyeU1PaGsxbi1ZcGY1eHIxalJMNlJkU3FSNHoyUGZCSUpDZjdUOU94YTJB</guid></item><item><title>定期锻炼可将结肠癌死亡率降低37% ，研究发现- ScienceAlert | Regular Exercise Reduces Death From Colon Cancer by 37%, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPb2VYdGJaSHY1OWtqSG1VdnNqWG9sMkFvSS1KVDlxTFkzbkhYRjlxTFY3TUlWcXM5Qzh1V3V2ZzBqLXZLYnFkVXlpdnVjeEZ4dW1YUkZtUzNJSTNNakMzRkJ1UDNVbnUzMWNqWmJVU2tXbml5NGp1ek9OQUxjSEY3U3F1WEs4RV9lNzBqM3lKbl92Ymk0SE5PNkFvVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New evidence has linked physical activity with improved colon health, underscoring the &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/exercise-guidelines"&gt;vital role of exercise&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="163578" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; prevention and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The landmark international trial – the Challenge study – showed that structured exercise programmes can dramatically improve survival rates for colon cancer survivors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was unveiled at the meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/annual-meeting"&gt;American Society of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;. Each June, cancer specialists from around the world convene in Chicago for the conference where new research is announced that pushes the boundaries of cancer treatment and this year's conference featured a wealth of exciting discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conducted across six countries and published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the Challenge study tracked 889 patients for several years following chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one received standard post-treatment care, while the other took part in a three-year coaching programme that included personalised exercise plans and regular check-ins with fitness professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Those in the exercise group experienced 28% fewer cancer recurrences and 37% fewer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the programme, people slowly built up how much they exercised, with most choosing to go on brisk 45-minute walks four times a week. Ninety per cent of the people who exercised stayed cancer free for five years, compared with just 74% of those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first strong evidence that exercise not only correlates with better outcomes but directly improves survival rates in cancer patients. While &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/04/22/bjsports-2024-109392"&gt;earlier observational studies&lt;/a&gt; found a link between being active and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9454950/"&gt;better cancer outcomes&lt;/a&gt;, this first randomised controlled trial helps show causation, meaning that exercise can directly benefit the survival of cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't know yet if the same goes for other cancers like breast, prostate or lung, but it's a big step forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programme's success hinged on consistent support. Participants met with fitness coaches every two weeks at first, then monthly, which helped them stick to their routines even after treatment ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While minor injuries such as muscle strains were slightly more common among those who exercised (19% compared to 12% in the control group), researchers emphasised that these issues were manageable and far outweighed by the significant survival benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential downsides to exercise?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the encouraging findings on structured exercise, a separate study presented in Chicago has &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14768309/colon-cancer-running-asco-2025.html"&gt;raised questions&lt;/a&gt; about the potential downsides of extreme endurance training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracking marathon runners found a higher rate of polyps (small growths in the colon that can sometimes develop into cancer) compared with the general population. This unexpected finding has sparked a fresh debate about the effect of high-intensity exercise on long-term colon health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, context is needed. The study did not find higher cancer rates among runners, and most of the detected polyps were low risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163587" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163587" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/marathon_642.jpg" alt="marathon runner" class="wp-image-163587 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/marathon_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/marathon_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/marathon_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163587" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Marathon runners are found with more polyps, but the reasons might be complicated. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEJL_wthPo/"&gt;vgajic/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several possible explanations have been offered: endurance athletes may simply undergo more frequent screenings, leading to increased detection, or intense exercise might temporarily raise inflammation markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the overall risk of cancer remains lower in active people than in those who are more sedentary, reinforcing the well-established protective benefits of regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This apparent contradiction highlights the medical community's evolving understanding of the "dose" of physical activity. While moderate exercise is consistently linked to &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet"&gt;significant health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, emerging data from endurance athletes suggests that extreme, high-intensity training may place different kinds of stress on the body's systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also suggest that factors such as dehydration during long-distance runs, changes in gut function, or the use of certain nutritional supplements common among endurance athletes could play a role in polyp development. These findings don't diminish the well-documented benefits of physical activity, but instead point to the importance of personalised, balanced health strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For cancer survivors, the structured exercise study provides a message of practical hope. Participants aimed for the equivalent of about three hours of brisk walking per week, gradually increasing their activity levels over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programme's social support was key, with fitness coaches helping participants tailor their routines to match their abilities and recovery needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is believed to &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/cancer-exercise-treatment-study-b2762054.html"&gt;affect key biological processes&lt;/a&gt; – including insulin sensitivity, inflammation and immune function – that &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colon-cancer-survival-rates-exercise-study/"&gt;play important roles&lt;/a&gt; in cancer development and progression. Ongoing research is analysing participants' blood samples to better understand these mechanisms and eventually create personalised exercise "prescriptions" based on an individual's genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the findings from marathon runners are less conclusive, they still offer practical takeaways. The research suggests that although vigorous exercise is generally beneficial, high-intensity athletes may face a higher risk of developing polyps and should therefore consider regular colonoscopies as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the general public, these findings reinforce that combining moderate exercise with timely screenings offers the best protection against colon cancer, a disease that remains the fourth most common worldwide and is &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;alarmingly increasing among young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both patients and athletes, these findings highlight a central truth: movement matters, but the right approach is crucial. Colon cancer survivors now have proven tools to reduce recurrence through structured exercise, while endurance enthusiasts gain motivation to pair their training with preventative care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As science continues unravelling the intricate dance between activity and biology, one message remains clear: whether recovering from illness or chasing personal bests, informed exercise combined with medical guidance is the most reliable path to long-term health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257983/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Tuesday, 307 days after he was first admitted to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), KJ Muldoon went home after being successfully treated with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.genengnews.com/topics/genome-editing/asgct-2025-worlds-first-patient-treated-with-personalized-crispr-therapy/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;first personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. KJ, who was born with a serious and rare genetic condition called severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, received two doses of a&lt;/span&gt; base editor bound to a bespoke targeting guide sequence &lt;span&gt;using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) when he was 7 and 8 months old. Around two months after the second infusion, KJ was discharged with his parents, Nicole and Kyle, accompanied by a police escort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;KJ’s case was brought to the world’s attention on May 15, 2025, when Kiran Musunuru, MD, PhD, presented it in a plenary session at the American Society for Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) in New Orleans. The case was described in detail in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; led by Musunuru published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-12"&gt;&lt;span id="malgam_render_2" data-render-ad="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m overwhelmed to see the pictures of KJ at home, with his family, for the first time,” Musunuru told &lt;em&gt;Inside Precision Medicine.&lt;/em&gt; “Somehow that hits harder, makes it more real for me, than anything else that’s happened over the past 10 months. And it just increases my determination to find ways to do the same for as many kids as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A (team) race against time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Kyle and Nicole Muldoon’s newborn son, KJ, was diagnosed with severe CPS1 deficiency, hope seemed elusive. The rare genetic disorder, marked by toxic ammonia buildup in the blood, often leads to severe neurological damage or death in infancy. With KJ too young for a liver transplant, the standard treatment for severe CPS1 deficiency, the Muldoons faced limited options. That is, until an experimental therapy offered a glimmer of hope.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;CHOP physician-scientist Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, MD, PhD, proposed a groundbreaking solution: a personalized CRISPR gene editing therapy designed to correct KJ’s unique genetic mutations in the &lt;em&gt;CPS1&lt;/em&gt; gene. This uncharted approach represented a dramatic pivot in treating rare genetic disorders, leveraging the precision of CRISPR technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Within weeks of diagnosis, researchers identified the mutations causing KJ’s condition—two truncating variants of the &lt;em&gt;CPS1&lt;/em&gt; gene. Using state-of-the-art CRISPR gene-editing tools, Musunuru, of the University of Pennsylvania, and his team devised a bespoke therapy. The treatment used LNPs to deliver a base editor capable of correcting the mutations directly in KJ’s genome.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking the therapy from idea to an&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; FDA-approved clinical-grade drug—typically a years-long process—was expedited to six months through partnerships with organizations like the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) and Danaher Corporation. The FDA approved the treatment within a week, acknowledging the urgency of KJ’s case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within seven weeks after receiving the two infusions of personalized CRISPR gene-editing therapy, KJ’s condition began to improve. He could tolerate higher protein intake, required lower doses of nitrogen-scavenger medications, and started reaching developmental milestones, such as sitting upright—a feat once uncertain. KJ’s story is a testament to resilience and innovation. His parents, Kyle and Nicole, found strength in the possibility of a breakthrough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reflecting on the journey, Kyle remarked, “If you’re going through something of this nature, it’s important to find the tiniest bead of hope and hold onto that as long as you can.” KJ turned ten months old on June 1. His case not only marks a medical milestone but also sets a precedent for treating rare genetic disorders with speed, precision, and compassion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scaling gene editing for rare diseases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the long-term effects of the treatment remain unknown, KJ’s case underscores the potential of personalized gene-editing therapies to transform medicine. This patient-first approach could democratize access to life-saving treatments. By rapidly customizing therapies to individual genetic mutations, CRISPR-based solutions could address previously untreatable rare diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-12"&gt;&lt;span id="malgam_render_4" data-render-ad="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2505704"&gt;&lt;span&gt;editorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published alongside the &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt; study, Peter Marks, MD, former FDA CBER director, highlighted the transformative potential of the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; gene-editing treatment KJ received for rare diseases, emphasizing how rapid diagnosis, customized gene editing, and innovative delivery methods could serve as a model for tackling thousands of rare conditions. Marks discussed the importance of platform technologies, which streamline regulatory pathways by reusing standardized components like mRNA backbones and delivery systems. This approach reduces development complexity and cost, enabling the customization of therapies at scale. Marks argued that this framework could transform N-of-1 therapies into scalable solutions for rare diseases, unlocking broader commercial viability and benefiting millions worldwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t just a vision, and the landmark therapeutic wasn’t pulled out of thin air. The IGI and Danaher were able to step in and manufacture KJ’s personalized gene editing therapy because their partnership, the Danaher-IGI Beacon for CRISPR Cures, aims to revolutionize personalized medicine with CRISPR-based technologies. The partnership focuses on scalable delivery systems, affordable manufacturing, and global accessibility to treat rare and underserved diseases, which was detailed in a recent in-depth &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/topics/precision-medicine/personalized-gene-therapy-for-all/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;interview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with Brad Ringeisen, PhD, the IGI’s executive director. Notable programs for the Danaher-IGI Beacon for CRISPR Cures include collaborations on Artemis-SCID, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, cancer, and diseases of the nervous system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ringeisen emphasized that partnerships with global institutions and regulatory bodies will be crucial in creating umbrella trials for multiple diseases, utilizing standardized CRISPR tools to bring personalized gene editing therapies to patients worldwide, and making a transformative impact on global health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At CHOP, Musunuru and Athens-Nicolas are trudging ahead in parallel to the Danaher-IGI Beacon for CRISPR Cures. Musunuru said, “Becca Ahrens-Nicklas and I are hard at work in taking the next steps towards our ultimate goal, which is to partner with the FDA to establish a robust gene editing platform that can be deployed to treat any inborn error of metabolism in the liver, so that nobody will need to undertake a heroic effort to help a child like KJ—it will simply be the standard of care.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re pumping protein — and guzzling sugar bombs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fairlife’s Core Power protein shakes — beloved by fitness fanatics and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/03/health/drugs-like-ozempic-can-affect-your-fertility-dietitian-warns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ozempic users&lt;/a&gt; alike — have just been crowned the unhealthiest bottled beverage in America, despite their muscle-boosting reputation, according to &lt;a href="https://www.eatthis.com/unhealthiest-bottled-drinks-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eat This, Not That!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shakes like these are a “great way to start the day without having to sit down and have a full breakfast,” gushed Elise Ramer, a 42-year-old PR pro in Florida, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/us-news/ozempic-mounjaro-users-drink-protein-shakes-to-beef-up-muscles/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on by The Post. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramer said she puts Core Power in her coffee while taking the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/health/fda-cracking-down-on-ozempic-copycats-potentially-slimming-options-for-consumers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;weight-loss drug Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt; — since users need to focus on their protein intake due to the possible muscle loss side effect. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But nutrition experts are throwing a red flag on the play.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I put these first [as the unhealthiest bottled drink in the U.S.] because they are so highly marketed as a great source of protein and a healthy food when in reality they are a disaster to your metabolic health,” registered dietitian Mary Sabat recently told Eat This, Not That!&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts warn that protein shakes — a hit with many Ozempic users (above) — are hyped as health drinks but are actually a metabolic meltdown in a bottle. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;myskin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Core Power protein shakes may seem like a convenient post-workout drink, but a closer look at the ingredients reveals several health concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shakes are made by Fairlife, owned by Coca-Cola, and boast up to 42 grams of protein per bottle — but that muscle comes with a side of controversy. According to Sabat, it’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/12/health/what-ozempic-like-drugs-may-treat-beyond-obesity-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not just about sugar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They use non-organic, conventional dairy, which often comes from cows fed GMO corn and soy and may contain residues of hormones and antibiotics — unlike grass-fed dairy, which is higher in omega-3s and CLA and free from harmful residues,” she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The addition of carrageenan, a thickening agent linked to gut inflammation and irritation, further detracts from its health profile.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sabat also slammed the inclusion of artificial sweeteners like sucralose and acesulfame potassium, warning they’ve been “associated with gut microbiome disruption and potential carcinogenic effects in animal studies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The shakes, churned out by Coca-Cola-owned Fairlife, pack a whopping 42 grams of protein — but that muscle boost comes with a side of scandal. And it’s not just sugar, warns Sabat. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jammy Jean – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “Lastly, the label includes ‘natural flavors,’ a term that can encompass up to 100 different undisclosed chemical additives, many of which are far from natural. Together, these ingredients make Core Power far less healthy than its marketing implies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That hasn’t stopped the protein craze. Thanks to the Ozempic effect, these shakes are flying off shelves faster than a gym bro’s tank top.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sales of protein and meal-replacement drinks surged 11.1% to a whopping $4.7 billion last year — and it’s the Ozempic army leading the charge, retail tracker SPINS revealed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As The Post previously reported, Rila Global Consulting found 13% of those on GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro had consumed protein shakes in the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;But some experts warn that overloading on protein — especially the highly processed kind — can backfire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;As The Post previously reported, 13% of Ozempic and Mounjaro users have chugged protein shakes in the past two years, according to Rila Global Consulting. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Tobias Arhelger – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joseph Antoun, CEO of longevity company L-Nutra, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/28/health/how-much-protein-you-need-and-what-happens-if-you-eat-too-much/"&gt;previously told The Post&lt;/a&gt; that too much animal protein can raise IGF-1 levels, a hormone linked to accelerated aging, cancer and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The goal isn’t to just build muscle — it’s to live long enough to use it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, maybe stick to a protein-packed egg — and leave the mystery “natural flavors” to the lab rats.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With recent advancements in technology, the Internet of Things and wireless devices are in high demand. However, these innovations also raise concerns about prolonged exposure to electromagnetic radiation (EMR), which may pose potential risks to eye health.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;MXenes, a class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides, have shown promise in shielding against EMR. However, their poor adhesion and susceptibility to oxidation have limited their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent breakthrough, researchers led by Professor Takeo Miyake from the Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan, have developed stable MXene-coated contact lenses with remarkable optical and EMR shielding properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their novel fabrication method ensures optimum adhesion and prevents oxidation of the MXene coating, overcoming previous limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was a collaborative effort between Waseda University, Kyoto University, and Yamaguchi University Hospital, bringing together expertise in nanofabrication, 2D materials, and ophthalmology to ensure eye safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/smsc.202400628" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Small Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was co-authored by Dr. Lunjie Hu from the Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University; Associate Professor Jun Hirotani from Kyoto University; Professor Kazuhiro Kimura from Yamaguchi University Hospital; Assistant Professor Atsushige Ashimori from Yamaguchi University Hospital; and Assistant Professor Saman Azhari from the Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Smart contact lenses with built-in electronic components are getting a lot of attention as the next big thing in wearable devices. For the first time, though, this means we'll be placing wireless circuit lenses directly on our corneas, exposing them to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/electromagnetic+waves/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electromagnetic waves&lt;/a&gt; around the clock. Inspired by breakthroughs in 2D materials and device fabrication technologies, we came up with highly functional protective contact lenses," says lead author Prof. Miyake.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;To fabricate these highly functional contact lenses, the research team started by preparing dispersions of MXene, which were vacuum filtered with mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membranes to produce MXene-based films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The films were then coated onto commercial soft contact lenses through a wet transfer approach using acetone. The prepared lenses were then analyzed extensively for physical properties, conductivity, and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We chose a wet-transfer method for the effortless attachment of MXene nanosheets to the unconventionally shaped surface of soft contact lenses, which ensures scalability," adds Prof. Miyake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabricated contact lenses showed remarkable results with &amp;gt;80% visible light transmission, high conductivity, dehydration protection, and high biocompatibility with &amp;gt;90% cell viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deposited layers of MXene showed variable thickness based on the concentrations of the dispersions, and the adhesive properties of the dissolved MCE membrane ensured optimum attachment of MXene. Additionally, the MCE layer also protected the MXene from oxidizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Miyake discusses the significance of their method, saying, "Our research can have a multifaceted impact. First, the stable and effortless coating of MXene nanosheets via wet transfer broadens the possibilities for commercial applications. Secondly, our method is simple yet effective in preventing MXene oxidation, turning a commonly overlooked challenge—MXene oxidation—into a resolved obstacle."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;To assess electromagnetic shielding, the MXene-coated lenses were tested on porcine eyes exposed to microwave heating and thermal imaging. The lenses exhibited a rapid temperature rise, indicating strong EMR absorption and dissipation, which prevented direct heating of the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When exposed to high-frequency microwaves, MXene effectively absorbed electromagnetic energy and released it as thermal radiation, thereby protecting the porcine eyes from direct heating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers confirmed a robust electromagnetic shielding efficiency of up to 93%, representing the highest reported specific shielding effectiveness for biocompatible materials at the same thickness level, offering substantial protection against high-frequency radiation. The lenses demonstrated strong protection against high-frequency EMR, ensuring optimal eye health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With high electromagnetic protection and reliable properties, this breakthrough in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/smart+contact+lenses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;smart contact lenses&lt;/a&gt; represents a significant advancement toward safer wearable technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the unique properties of MXene nanosheets, the lenses provide effective protection against high-frequency radiation while maintaining comfort and usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond eye health, this breakthrough paves the way for the integration of advanced nanomaterials in smart wearables, medical implants, and bioelectronics, addressing both safety and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Health officials in Utah opted not to notify the public about a measles case that entered the state last month, citing low risk and prior vaccination. The case first came into public light Monday afternoon, during a &lt;a href="https://summitcounty.granicus.com/player/clip/923?view_id=1&amp;amp;redirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Summit County Board of Health meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the individual had previously been vaccinated, significantly reducing the risk of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This individual had previously been vaccinated and posed a low risk of infection to others,” DHHS said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 19 – traveler arrives in Utah, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 23 – traveler returns to Salt Lake City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 19, an international traveler flew from Canada to Salt Lake City and rented a car to drive to southern Idaho. Utah health officials emphasized that the person did not make any stops in Utah before leaving the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their stay in Idaho, the individual then became symptomatic and was diagnosed with measles, and all exposure concerns were in Idaho, according to DHHS. A few days later, the individual returned to Utah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On May 23, that same individual came back to Salt Lake, again didn’t make any stops but did get on board an airplane while symptomatic,” said Derek Moss, Summit County Nursing Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public health response &amp;amp; passenger notifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DHHS explained that the individual had been cleared by public health to fly, as they were deemed past their infectious period before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials contacted passengers from the flight and provided resources to prevent infection, and at this point, no additional measles infections have been reported among exposed passengers, though health officials continue to monitor those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“State and local health officials are staying in touch with those individuals, and none of them has developed a measles infection. The typical incubation period is 1-3 weeks.” said DHHS in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clarifications on public health procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DHHS addressed several points of misinformation Tuesday after information about the case became public during the Summit County Board of Health meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The traveler was never placed on a “do not board” list, contrary to some reports, as they were past their infectious period by the time of their flight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While one of the vaccines they received is not approved in the U.S., health officials emphasized that any dose of an MMR vaccine significantly decreases the risk of spreading measles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t officials issue a public health advisory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about its decision to withhold a public advisory, the DHHS provided the following explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Public health officials weigh many factors when we decide whether to notify the public about a situation. In low-risk situations, when we are able to address the issue in a more focused and isolated manner, broad public messaging is not always warranted. Additional information would be released if the situation changes or more data suggests an increased risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles prevention &amp;amp; summer travel advisory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the limited risk in this incident, measles remains highly contagious. Due to increasing cases across North and South America, health officials urge Utah residents to verify their vaccination status before traveling this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We encourage Utahns to talk to a pharmacist or healthcare provider to verify their vaccination status prior to summer travel,” said DHHS in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMR vaccine remains one of the most effective measures against measles and is recommended for anyone planning to travel in regions experiencing outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Raw cheese is aged. “FDA regulations require raw cheese to be &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/sampling-protect-food-supply/microbiological-surveillance-sampling-fy14-16-raw-milk-cheese-aged-60-days" target="_blank"&gt;aged at least 60 days&lt;/a&gt;,” says Rao. “During this time, harmful bacteria are often neutralized by natural cultures and lactic acid, making the cheese safer.”&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just romantic old-world tradition; it’s science-backed risk mitigation. So yes, raw Brie de Meaux, aged Roquefort, or Manchego? &lt;i&gt;Bon appétit.&lt;/i&gt; But raw milk straight from the udder? That’s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

It suggests a troubling link to sugar specifically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Emma Schatoff, a medical oncologist from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who led the study, told the Daily Mail: 'Young people were coming in with metastatic disease, or cancer that had spread everywhere — it was in their liver, lungs, other organs - and they were very surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We looked at anything that could have raised their risk level. We looked at inflammatory bowel disease and medication use, but found no difference there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then we looked at diet, and found no link with processed foods or red meat. But we did find a link with high sugar foods in stage four patients diagnosed with the disease for the first time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli (left) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last spring at 36 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'We defined a high sugar diet as daily consumption of high sugar foods, such as a [single] soda or a candy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought that sugar can cause damaging changes to the gut microbiome, which can lead to mutations in cells that result in tumors forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 63 percent of Americans aged 18 or older report consuming at least one soda a day, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study included 303 colon cancer patients under 50 years old, of which 112 had stage four disease and 191 had stages one to three disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each filled in a dietary questionnaire to allow researchers to analyze their consumption and detect any possible links between their diets and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were asked: 'Two to five years before diagnosis, how often did you have one serving of high sugar foods (eg soft drinks, candy).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 45 percent of stage 4 patients reported daily consumption of high sugar foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By comparison the share was 29 percent in the group with less advanced cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Consuming high sugar drinks could raise your risk of being diagnosed with advanced colon cancer, a study suggests &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study concludes: 'In a single center study, in early-onset colon cancer patients, high sugar diets may be associated with de novo [new] metastatic disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual conference in Chicago, Illinois, the biggest gathering of cancer researchers in the world, which is attended by 40,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results have been published &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244792"&gt;as an abstract&lt;/a&gt;, and not yet in a scientific journal where they will be reviewed by other scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say that regularly consuming sodas can cause sugar to build-up in the colon when it cannot be fully absorbed, changing the gut microbiome and potentially boosting levels of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also say sugar can be used as fuel for tumor cells which may cause the cancer to grow faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published last year found that diets low in fiber and high in sugar spark the proliferation of a bacteria called Fusobacterium in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes widespread inflammation in the gut, which has been shown to age cells, making them more vulnerable to cancer-causing mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured, died of colon cancer at just 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new study 51 percent of patients were female. All had no previous cancer diagnosis and were under 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals diagnosed with stage four were younger, at an average age of 41 years, compared to 43 years in the other group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates that 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year and 52,900 will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the 1990s early-onset colon cancer has increased by 50 percent and rates are expected to double between 2010 and 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They see a rich color on the crust and feel reassured by words like wholegrain or freshly baked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/about_us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Young&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Real Bread Campaign&lt;/a&gt; notes that the color alone doesn’t always match what’s actually inside the loaf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some manufacturers add caramelized ingredients for a darker hue, which can create the appearance of a more wholesome, wheat bread product than it really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s been growing focus on how certain ingredients might affect our health. One example is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emulsifiers&lt;/a&gt;, which are additives that change the texture of bread and extend its shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has revealed that these substances can disrupt our &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4290017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. This concern is one of the reasons people pay extra for options that look better on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The likes of ‘wholegrain’, ‘sourdough’, ‘ancient grains’ and ‘freshly baked’ provide no guarantee of how, where, or when a product was made, or with what,” said Chris Young. Empty claims can appear on “wheat” bread packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wheat-bread-pitfalls"&gt;Wheat bread pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us want a loaf of bread that’s genuinely wholesome, yet it can be tricky to know what’s in that bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some manufacturers add caramelized brown sugar or molasses to enhance the depth of color,” said &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duane-Mellor-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duane Mellor&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and senior lecturer at &lt;a href="https://www.aston.ac.uk/hls/aston-medical-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aston Medical School&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step can mislead people, who might mistake color for genuine nutritional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains provide many nutrients, including fiber and vitamins. For a healthier option, a dietitian named &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/learn/sammie-gill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sammie Gill&lt;/a&gt; recommends looking for a loaf with fewer ingredients. That suggestion can help people skip the extras that make bread soft but may not promote wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sourdough-confusions"&gt;Sourdough confusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm for tangy, longer-fermented bread is on the rise. True sourdough usually starts with a live bacterial culture and no baker’s yeast, which can slow digestion of carbs and help regulate blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the product is named or marketed using the word sourdough, but the ingredients list reveals the use of baker’s yeast, a chemical raising agent, or any additive, it’s sourfaux,” said Chris Young. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mislabeled products do pop up. A quick label check is often enough to tell which one is genuinely fermented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fermentation stage takes longer, so true sourdough can cost more. Some brands cut corners by adding yeast to speed things up and still call it sourdough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-fiber-and-fermentation-matter"&gt;Why fiber and fermentation matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bread that’s higher in dietary fiber helps feed the good bacteria in your gut, which in turn can support digestion, immune function, and even mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wholemeal and rye &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/freezing-bread-could-make-it-healthier/"&gt;breads&lt;/a&gt; naturally contain more of this fiber compared to white bread, making them more effective at supporting a balanced microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented breads like real sourdough can take that one step further. The long fermentation process produces compounds that promote short-chain fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects are strongest when breads are made without additives and use traditional sourdough starters, not shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-choosing-the-healthiest-option"&gt;Choosing the healthiest option&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of bread on the market, from rustic rye to seeded whole wheat bread. Those that contain more authentic whole grains tend to have higher levels of fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rye bread is well liked for its dense texture and earthy taste. It can also contain a solid amount of fiber, which can aid digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts suggest blending your grain choices, since each type provides different nutrients. Some days might call for sourdough, while others might be better suited for a traditional wholemeal loaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-gluten-free-breads"&gt;What about gluten-free breads?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who avoid gluten often reach for gluten-free breads expecting similar benefits to wholegrain loaves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many of these products are ultra-processed and contain added starches, gums, and stabilizers that don’t offer the same fiber or nutrient profile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they’re helpful for those with &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/celiacdisease.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; or gluten intolerance, they’re not always healthier by default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialty &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-bread-wheat-gave-rise-to-civilization/"&gt;breads&lt;/a&gt; like those made with ancient grains, such as spelt, einkorn, or teff, can offer additional nutritional value. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These grains often contain more protein and minerals than standard &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/u-s-wheat-market-has-been-remarkably-resilient-amid-climate-change/"&gt;wheat&lt;/a&gt;, and some people find them easier to digest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, label reading remains important, since not every “ancient grain” loaf is made with a significant amount of the grain it advertises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-closing-thoughts"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also matters how many slices you eat. Two slices of wholemeal bread in a day can help meet part of a suggested three daily servings of whole grains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some folks vary with wholegrain cereals, brown rice, or popcorn, which helps feed different kinds of gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wrap-up is that color alone won’t guarantee a loaf’s &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forests-provide-different-health-benefits-based-on-their-structure/"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. A little time spent scanning labels can reveal whether a brown loaf is plain white bread in disguise or a truly beneficial staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666833524002028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 23:10:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOOTFXek9PMlRMcVZianJFb3hhN0hhalpKUzAyTlMzTWNhX051dkF3ZHJaelpWZW1sTy1oNmZCbHZZSXdBaVpGb1UyajlTZHJWdURjTVhpdTFKVDhwcUYtNFl4NEFUSXpDRTVBeF9MZHI4Y0g5Nkx2cDQtTHFLcHBSUG15Q1ZmWVRmeDJMbUUzcHRURERSdl9MQlBBZzBPZ2NHUS1lSEgyT0lla015YUtDWlpBZw</guid></item></channel></rss>
