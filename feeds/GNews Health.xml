It describes a woman whose condition causes her to perceive&lt;strong&gt; human faces&lt;/strong&gt; as transforming into &lt;strong&gt;dragon-like faces&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unnamed patient, a 52-year-old woman from The Hague, Netherlands, visited a psychiatric clinic and told doctors that while faces initially appeared normal, they became distorted after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="post-highlights"&gt;&lt;span class="h2"&gt;Highlights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A rare neurological disorder, PMO, causes a woman to see human faces turn into dragon-like creatures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;MRI revealed brain lesions, which doctor believe affected the part of the brain that processes colors and faces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="bullet-wrapper"&gt;&lt;i class="bullet"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The woman reportedly experienced PMO symptoms since childhood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2011 case, published by &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; three years later, the woman reported that faces “turned black, grew long pointy ears and a protruding snout, and displayed a reptiloid skin and huge eyes in bright yellow, green, blue, or red.&lt;span&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-tablet-ad-within-content post-ads"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt;&lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.freepik.com/search?format=search&amp;amp;last_filter=query&amp;amp;last_value=dragons&amp;amp;query=dragons" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Freepik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also described seeing dragon-like faces drifting towards her from walls, electrical sockets, or her computer screen. These visions occurred both in the presence and absence of people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors conducted a neurological examination, blood tests, and an electroencephalogram (EEG), a brain-scanning technique.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961690-1/fulltext" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, the results were normal. However, an MRI of her brain showed several lesions near the lentiform nucleus. Damage to this part of the brain has been linked to cognitive impairments, such as issues with memory and processing speed, and is associated with schizophrenia and other neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="prosopometamorphopsia-human-dragon-face-6-68b08d1e83372__700" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/rare-condition-made-a-woman-see-people-as-dragons/?image_id=prosopometamorphopsia-human-dragon-face-6-68b08d1e83372__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Terrifying: Rare Condition Makes Woman See Dragons Instead Of People" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/rare-condition-made-a-woman-see-people-as-dragons/?media_id=prosopometamorphopsia-human-dragon-face-6-68b08d1e83372__700" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/prosopometamorphopsia-human-dragon-face-6-68b08d1e83372__700.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/prosopometamorphopsia-human-dragon-face-6-68b08d1e83372__700.jpg" alt="Doctor examining a woman’s eyes in a clinical setting, related to rare condition causing dragon visual distortions." title="Doctor examining a woman’s eyes in a clinical setting, related to rare condition causing dragon visual distortions." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/young-woman-at-a-neurologist-appointment-doctor-checks-reflexes-with-a-special-flashlight-uzq9SL23teU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Getty Images/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The doctors suspect that the lesions revealed by the MRI may have triggered atypical  electrical activity in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex, the part of the brain that processes colors and faces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lesions may have been present since the patient’s birth, possibly caused by temporary oxygen deprivation shortly before or after delivery, the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/misdiagnosed-food-related-health-condition-left-woman-with-ptsd/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;doctors&lt;/a&gt; theorized, as per &lt;em&gt;Live Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though the 52-year-old woman had experienced the condition since childhood, it did not “bother” her at the time.

There was a 16% reduction in risk of cardiovascular events in adults 50 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The data will be presented this weekend to thousands of cardiologists at the annual meeting of the &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-Events/ESC-Congress" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;European Society of Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; in Madrid, the world’s largest cardiology conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Charles Williams, the study’s author and global associate medical director at GSK, said: “We looked at the currently available evidence, and found that in this analysis, vaccination against herpes zoster was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Further research studies are now needed to find out whether this association can be attributed to an effect of herpes zoster vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The global systematic review was conducted using three scientific literature databases, and a meta analysis was conducted of phase 3 randomised controlled trials and observational studies assessing the effect of herpes zoster vaccination on cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The shingles jab is usually just taken once, and is typically administered in two doses, several months apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In total, 19 studies were included in the review. Eight observational studies and one randomised controlled trial met the inclusion criteria for studying the impact of the jab on cardiovascular events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccination is increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Filippo Crea, a cardiology professor at the Catholic University in Rome, who was not involved with the study, said: “These results support a growing body of evidence … which indicates that vaccinations reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Bryan Williams, the chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, also not involved with the research, welcomed the findings but said further research was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said: “There is great interest in studies suggesting the shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, although this analysis is largely based on observational studies, which cannot demonstrate cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We know that shingles can cause inflammation in the body, and that inflammation is a culprit in many heart and circulatory conditions which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By preventing shingles, vaccination could therefore be protective. But far more research is needed, especially to understand the intriguing results in younger people. More evidence will be needed before the shingles vaccine can be recommended for a wider age group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings came as NHS England said &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/08/shingles-vaccine-to-be-offered-to-hundreds-of-thousands-more-immunosuppressed-adults/#:~:text=Around%20300%2C000%20more%20people%20will,protect%20all%20severely%20immunosuppressed%20adults." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;300,000 more people would become eligible for the shingles jab from next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People eligible from 1 September are those between 18 and 49 with a severely weakened immune system.

After 40 minutes, it hits 118F, and after an hour, it can rise to 123F. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drinking water from plastic bottles left in vehicles could slowly poison the body, health experts are warning (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following their investigation, Nanjing University advised against storing plastic water bottles in warm temperatures, as the release of antimony and BPA increased with storage temperature, especially at 158°F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study in 2023 found similar results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, also looked at the impact of high temperatures on plastic water bottles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that four common plastics, including polyethylene, released microparticles and nanoparticles when they were heated to 98.6F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Control samples that were kept in a dark, 40F refrigerator, however, released few to no particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent study found that no matter what the brand, bottles of plastic water contain hundreds of thousands of toxic microscopic plastic particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists using the most advanced laser scanning techniques found an average of 240,000 plastic particles in a one-liter bottle of water, compared to 5.5 per one liter of tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Columbia University researchers tested three popular brands of bottled water sold in the US - and, using lasers, analyzed the plastic particles they contained down to just 100 nanometers in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The particles - nanoplastics - are much smaller than the microplastics previously detected in bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the particles are considered potentially toxic because they are so small that they can enter directly into blood cells and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These microscopic particles carry phthalates - chemicals that make plastics more durable, flexible, and last longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Phthalate exposure is attributed to 100,000 premature deaths in the US each year.

The accumulation of these substances was higher in cancerous tissues compared to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the findings, health experts across the board have called for policymakers and industry leaders to take immediate action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from London-based Deep Science Ventures warned after they conducted an eight-month investigation into the impact of chemical exposure on human health: 'Based on our findings, failure to act decisively will likely lead to irreversible consequences for both human health and the delicate balance of our planet's ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Policymakers should consider the impact of toxicity on fertility, especially as many countries are struggling to boost it using expensive other incentives.

Reporting of illnesses caused by &lt;em&gt;Campylobacter, Cyclospora, Listeria, Shigella, Vibrio, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Yersinia&lt;/em&gt; is now optional, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story was first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-quietly-scaled-back-surveillance-program-foodborne-illnesses-rcna227089?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;amp;taid=68add0b9b2316600014ce6de&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=bluesky"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, which cited a set of CDC talking points that suggested reduced federal funding for FoodNet was the reason for the move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, and select counties in California and New York. A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health told CIDRAP News that all eight pathogens are covered by the state's infectious disease reporting rule, which means that all providers in the state are still required to report cases to the department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Health Department told NBC News that it will also continue tracking all eight pathogens regardless of the changes to FoodNet. But Colorado health officials said they may have to cut back on surveillance activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to a query from CIDRAP News, an HHS spokesperson said in an email that FoodNet is focusing on &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;and STEC because they are among the top five contributors to foodborne illnesses and related hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. The official added that the CDC has different surveillance systems that track infections caused by the other pathogens, and that narrowing FoodNet's reporting requirements will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Active, population-based surveillance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;FoodNet has been around since 1995 and was created in the wake of the 1992-93 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;E coli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; O157:H7 outbreak linked to Jack-in-the-Box hamburgers. &lt;/span&gt;According to Craig Hedberg, PhD, &lt;span&gt;a professor in the Division of Environmental Health Sciences at the University of Minnesota and codirector of the Minnesota Integrated Food Safety Center of Excellence, it was built using the CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP) sites, which conducts population-based surveillance for a range of infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The idea was to perform active surveillance for seven foodborne pathogens that would be commonly diagnosed by clinical laboratories that served the populations in the FoodNet site catchment areas," Hedberg explained, with FoodNet auditing the labs to ensure that all diagnosed illnesses caused by the pathogens were reported. (An eighth pathogen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cyclospora,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; was added in 1997).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Food poisoning is a common cause of illness in the United States. According to the CDC, which bases its estimates on FoodNet surveillance, 48 million American get sick from a foodborne illness each year. Although most people recover from foodborne disease without requiring medical attention, 128,000 are hospitalized annually, and 3,000 die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Salmonella &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;and STEC are leading causes of foodborne illness in the United States, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; are also common culprits. According to the CDC, 1.5 million Americans are sickened by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; each year, while &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is the third leading cause of death from foodborne illness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The disturbing thing about cutting FoodNet funds is that it normalizes the idea that foodborne disease surveillance is expensive and unimportant....In fact, it is the foundation of our food safety system, and needs further investments, not restrictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 2024 outbreak of listeriosis linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/listeria/listeria-outbreak-tied-deli-meats-grows-death-toll-reaches-9"&gt;Boar's Head deli meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; sickened at least 61 people in 19 states and was suspected in 10 deaths. A more recent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; outbreak tied to packaged, pre-cooked meals has caused 17 illnesses and 3 deaths.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It is especially heartbreaking to know that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Listeria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; is one of the pathogens that will not be tracked through FoodNet," said public health and veterinary consultant Gail Hansen, DVM, MPH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though states can continue to monitor for infections caused by all eight pathogens, Hansen said she's concerned that reduced FoodNet surveillance could hamper the ability to catch and notify the public about foodborne disease outbreaks before they spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The beauty of FoodNet was that it collected and coordinated information from all the states about germs that make us sick and quickly communicated it to everyone," she said. "Despite what the current HHS administration believes, ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. States do not have the ability to coordinate information and data across states, and this cut will bring us back to a time before FoodNet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Foundation of the food safety system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hedberg noted that other CDC programs, like PulseNet, FoodCORE, and the Integrated Food Safety Centers of Excellence, are more actively focused on foodborne outbreak detection and investigation. But he warned that a loss of funding for these programs "would devastate our capacity to investigate outbreaks." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, Hedberg worries about the signal being sent by scaling back FoodNet surveillance efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The disturbing thing about cutting FoodNet funds is that it normalizes the idea that foodborne disease surveillance is expensive and unimportant," he said. "In fact, it is the foundation of our food safety system, and needs further investments, not restrictions."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It also supports our immune system, keeps our muscles functioning properly, and has some anti-inflammatory properties,” says &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Live It Up. Yet as important as vitamin D is, it can be difficult to get enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no superior way to get vitamin D. Getting vitamin D from a variety of sources is preferred,” says Diane Han, M.P.H., R.D.N., L.D., a registered dietitian nutritionist based in San Francisco and the founder of &lt;a href="https://wokingbalancewellness.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Woking Balance Wellness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Woking Balance Wellness&lt;/a&gt;.

The first is that the body can make vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin. The second is to get it from foods in which it naturally occurs, and the third is to consume it via foods that have been fortified with vitamin D. The fourth, then, is to take a vitamin D supplement, which contains two subtypes: D2 and D3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamins D2 and D3 are used similarly in the body,” says Han. Both need to be converted in the body to calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin D, or the form that your cells can actually use. Calcitriol is available as a prescription medication, per the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a682335.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Library of Medicine;&lt;/a&gt; it's used to treat low calcium and bone disease in patients with kidney or parathyroid dysfunction. But if you are looking to supplement with vitamin D, you'll be choosing between one of these two inactive forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a few key differences between D2 and D3, namely where they come from and how effective they are at improving vitamin D levels in the body (D3 seems to be slightly better in this department—more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where does vitamin D2 come from?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D2, also called ergocalciferol, comes mainly from plant sources and fungi such as mushrooms. Interestingly, when mushrooms are exposed to sunlight or UV light, they produce D2,” says Bakovic. She adds that D2 is also added to some foods, the most common of which are dairy, soy, almond, and rice milk, yogurt, kefir, cheese, and orange juice, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D2 is what is considered an inactive form of vitamin D, which means the body must transform it before being able to utilize it. “Once in your body, D2 is converted in the liver to a form called calcidiol, and then subsequently in the kidneys to calcitriol, which is the active form of D,” Bakovic explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What vitamin D2 does for your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After vitamin D2 is converted to the active form of vitamin D, the body can then use it for the processes mentioned above, such as reinforcing bones and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65797024/boost-immune-system-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:strengthening the immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;strengthening the immune system&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdrugs-supplements%2Fergocalciferol-oral-route%2Fdescription%2Fdrg-20523253&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, vitamin D2 may also be used in treatment plans for hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid glands), vitamin D-resistant rickets, and familial hypophosphatemia (low phosphorus in the blood), in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65403333/vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D deficiency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D deficiency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where does vitamin D3 come from?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65802092/what-vitamin-d3-does-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin D3;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin D3&lt;/a&gt;, or cholecalciferol, is another inactive form of vitamin D. Its sources include skin exposure to sunlight and animal-based foods such as salmon, sardines, egg yolks, and liver,” says Han. Similar to D2, D3 needs to go through a conversion process before the body is able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What vitamin D3 does for your health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There aren’t any specific processes that require D3 exclusively,” says Bakovic. “However, because it’s more bioavailable [meaning it enters the circulation and is able to impact the body], it is usually more effective in the prevention and/or correction of a Vitamin D deficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the key way in which vitamin D3 differs from D2. A 2024 review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://advances.nutrition.org/article/S2161-8313(23)01394-7/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Advances in Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;analyzed 20 studies that compared the efficacy of vitamin D2 versus vitamin D3 for raising the levels of vitamin D in the body and found that vitamin D3 was better at raising total vitamin D concentration in the blood. However, the researchers also found that when they looked at the concentration of hydroxylated (or active) vitamin D, the difference between D2 and D3 was negligible, especially in people who were taking it daily. So while D3 supplements do appear to be more bioavailable, both forms of vitamin D can be effective for combating vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vitamin D3 has been shown to be more effective at raising vitamin D levels when they are low, both D3 and D2 are easily converted in the body into the active, usable form we need to support key processes and optimize health. Still, the best thing to do before deciding which one to take is to talk to your doctor. They can help you determine if you can safely take vitamin D (it may interact with some medications and shouldn’t be taken if you have certain other medical problems, per the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Fdrugs-supplements%2Fergocalciferol-oral-route%2Fdescription%2Fdrg-20523253&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65905373%2Fvitamin-d2-vs-vitamin-d3%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;) and how much to take to get the benefits you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.

							&lt;p data-start="706" data-end="727"&gt;We’ve all met them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The 72-year-old who seems to carry light around with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The woman at the farmer’s market with laugh lines and glowing skin who looks like she’s aging in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="729" data-end="963"&gt;The grandfather who’s more energetic than his thirtysomething kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="965" data-end="1044"&gt;Yes, genetics matter. But psychology suggests there’s more going on than DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1046" data-end="1255"&gt;People who remain radiant and youthful into their 70s tend to share a set of daily practices that shape not only how they look, but how they carry themselves, how they connect, and how they radiate vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1257" data-end="1293"&gt;Here are eight of the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1300" data-end="1352"&gt;1. They reframe stress instead of stewing in it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1354" data-end="1494"&gt;Stress ages us faster than sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1354" data-end="1494"&gt;Cortisol, the stress hormone, has been linked to wrinkles, inflammation, and even memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1584"&gt;The youthful 70-somethings you meet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1496" data-end="1584"&gt;They’re not stress-free—they’re stress-resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1586" data-end="1800"&gt;Psychologically, they practice &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-reappraisal"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1617" data-end="1640"&gt;cognitive reappraisal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: reframing challenges as temporary, manageable, or even meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1586" data-end="1800"&gt;Instead of spiraling over a rude comment, they’ll shrug and think, &lt;em data-start="1776" data-end="1798"&gt;That’s not about me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1802" data-end="1948"&gt;It doesn’t erase problems, but it changes their body’s reaction. Less cortisol means less wear-and-tear. And less wear-and-tear means more glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1950" data-end="2055"&gt;So while others stew in negativity, they’ve mastered the art of letting go—and it shows on their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2062" data-end="2098"&gt;2. They stay socially connected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2100" data-end="2222"&gt;Loneliness doesn’t just hurt feelings—it hurts health. Studies show chronic loneliness can age cells as much as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2224" data-end="2432"&gt;The radiant elders?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2224" data-end="2432"&gt;They cultivate community. Weekly walks with neighbors. Standing phone calls with old friends. Joining choirs, gardening clubs, or book groups—not to kill time, but to nurture connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2434" data-end="2548"&gt;Psychology calls this &lt;em data-start="2456" data-end="2476"&gt;social integration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2434" data-end="2548"&gt;It feeds emotional needs, buffers stress, and keeps the brain sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2550" data-end="2731"&gt;Even small interactions—a chat with the cashier, a wave to the mail carrier—stack up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2550" data-end="2731"&gt;Over decades, they create a net of belonging that protects against isolation’s aging effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2733" data-end="2830"&gt;Youthfulness is contagious, and these people make sure they’re always plugged into the current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2837" data-end="2884"&gt;3. They move their bodies daily—but gently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2886" data-end="3028"&gt;We often assume youthful people are the ones grinding it out in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2886" data-end="3028"&gt;But many radiant elders aren’t lifting heavy—they’re simply moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3030" data-end="3143"&gt;Morning stretches. Daily walks. Gardening, dancing, swimming, yoga. Activities that feel joyful, not punishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3145" data-end="3285"&gt;Psychology explains this through &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/psychology/attitude-behavior-consistency"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3178" data-end="3202"&gt;behavioral consistency&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: when exercise is enjoyable, people stick to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3145" data-end="3285"&gt;When it’s punishing, they quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3287" data-end="3385"&gt;The result is decades of circulation, mobility, and energy—not burned-out joints and resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3387" data-end="3518"&gt;They don’t obsess over “fitness.” They weave movement into daily life like it’s brushing their teeth. And the glow is cumulative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3525" data-end="3557"&gt;4. They cultivate curiosity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3559" data-end="3681"&gt;There’s something unmistakable about a 70-year-old who still leans forward in conversation, eyes bright, eager to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="3846"&gt;Youthfulness isn’t just physical—it’s mental flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3683" data-end="3846"&gt;Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-openness-influences-your-behavior-4796351"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3765" data-end="3789"&gt;openness to experience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: the willingness to try new things, learn, and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3848" data-end="4014"&gt;People who age radiantly often read widely, ask questions, explore new hobbies, and stay culturally curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3848" data-end="4014"&gt;They don’t get stuck in &lt;em data-start="3981" data-end="4012"&gt;this is how it’s always been.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4016" data-end="4134"&gt;Curiosity keeps neural pathways active. It creates novelty, which sparks dopamine, which keeps mood and energy high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4136" data-end="4261"&gt;In short: they stay young because they stay interested. And people who are interested in life remain interesting to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4268" data-end="4312"&gt;5. They practice gratitude like hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4314" data-end="4418"&gt;Bitterness is heavy. It furrows brows, stiffens posture, and makes people look older than their years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4626"&gt;Radiant 70-somethings tend to practice gratitude daily—not as a grand gesture, but as a micro-habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4626"&gt;A pause over coffee. A whispered thank-you after a phone call. A nightly reflection on what went right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4628" data-end="4807"&gt;Psychology shows &lt;a href="https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-appreciation/"&gt;gratitude&lt;/a&gt; shifts attention toward abundance rather than lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4628" data-end="4807"&gt;Over time, this fosters optimism, which is strongly linked to resilience and even longer lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4809" data-end="4941"&gt;You can see it on their faces: softened lines, relaxed eyes, a kind of ease that comes from choosing appreciation over resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4943" data-end="5011"&gt;Gratitude isn’t just good manners. It’s anti-aging for the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5018" data-end="5064"&gt;6. They prioritize sleep like it’s sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5066" data-end="5189"&gt;We glorify busyness in younger decades, but by 70, the wise ones know: nothing steals glow faster than sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5191" data-end="5367"&gt;Psychologists emphasize the link between &lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-19400-1"&gt;sleep and emotional regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5191" data-end="5367"&gt;Without rest, people grow irritable, anxious, and more prone to stress—all of which accelerate aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5369" data-end="5520"&gt;Radiant elders treat sleep as non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5369" data-end="5520"&gt;They keep routines, respect bedtime, and protect their rest the way others protect their bank accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5522" data-end="5618"&gt;This consistency shows up in clearer skin, steadier moods, sharper minds, and better immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5620" data-end="5726"&gt;They don’t brag about “getting by” on five hours. They brag about eight—and the glow that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5733" data-end="5757"&gt;7. They laugh—a lot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5759" data-end="5910"&gt;It sounds simple, but laughter is medicine with measurable effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5759" data-end="5910"&gt;It reduces stress hormones, boosts immune function, and strengthens social bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5912" data-end="6067"&gt;Youthful elders aren’t humorless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5912" data-end="6067"&gt;They find reasons to laugh daily—through comedy, friends, silly stories, or simply not taking themselves too seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6069" data-end="6179"&gt;Psychologists frame this as &lt;em data-start="6097" data-end="6125"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2847490/"&gt;positive affect regulatio&lt;/a&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;: deliberately seeking joy to counterbalance stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6181" data-end="6297"&gt;Wrinkles from frowning deepen tension. Wrinkles from laughter deepen warmth. And everyone prefers the second kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6299" data-end="6414"&gt;If you want to look youthful at 70, stop worrying about the laugh lines—and start worrying if you don’t have any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6421" data-end="6449"&gt;8. They nurture purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6451" data-end="6532"&gt;Perhaps the most underrated habit: they have a reason to get up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6534" data-end="6736"&gt;Psychology calls this &lt;a href="https://kyoseiconsulting.com/ikigai-and-aging-well/"&gt;&lt;em data-start="6556" data-end="6564"&gt;ikigai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Japanese culture—a sense of life purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6534" data-end="6736"&gt;Whether it’s volunteering, mentoring, gardening, or simply being the glue of their family, radiant elders keep contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6738" data-end="6849"&gt;Purpose provides motivation, structure, and meaning. It keeps them mentally engaged and emotionally grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6851" data-end="6964"&gt;Without purpose, days feel flat and repetitive. With purpose, days feel alive—and that energy radiates outward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6966" data-end="7036"&gt;They don’t just live long. They live well. And that makes them glow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7043" data-end="7066"&gt;The bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7068" data-end="7282"&gt;Looking youthful into your 70s isn’t about chasing trends or obsessing over wrinkle creams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7068" data-end="7282"&gt;It’s about psychology—the small, consistent ways we frame our lives, regulate our emotions, and nurture our connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7284" data-end="7485"&gt;The elders who glow are rarely the ones who “had it easy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7284" data-end="7485"&gt;Many faced hardships, losses, health scares. But instead of letting those experiences calcify into bitterness, they turned them into wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7487" data-end="7581"&gt;And that’s the secret: youthfulness isn’t the absence of age. It’s the presence of vitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7588" data-end="7608"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7610" data-end="7695"&gt;Radiance at 70 doesn’t come from erasing the years. It comes from living them well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7697" data-end="7880"&gt;The habits are deceptively simple—gratitude, laughter, movement, connection—but over decades, they carve out something more powerful than perfect skin: a spirit that refuses to dim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7882" data-end="8026"&gt;And when you meet someone who carries that kind of light, you don’t think about their age. You just think, &lt;em data-start="7989" data-end="8024"&gt;I want to glow like that someday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Inside every human brain lies a detailed map of the body, with different regions dedicated to different body parts – the hands, lips, feet and more. But what happens to this map when a body part is removed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/144/7/1929/6206526"&gt;scientists believed&lt;/a&gt; that when a body part is amputated, the brain's body map dramatically reorganises itself, with neighbouring body parts taking over the area once represented by the missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea of large-scale brain reorganisation became a central pillar of what neuroscientists call adult brain plasticity: the ability of the brain to change its structure and function in response to injuries, new experiences or training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-medieval-italian-man-replaced-his-amputated-hand-with-a-knife"&gt;This Medieval Italian Man Replaced His Amputated Hand With a Knife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02037-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, shows the opposite is true: the brain's body map remains strikingly stable, even years after amputation.&lt;br&gt;
To test what happens in the brain after a person loses a body part, we took a unique approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with NHS surgeons, we followed three adult patients who were preparing to undergo lifesaving arm amputations for medical reasons, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; or severe problems with blood supply. We scanned their brains with functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;) before the amputation and repeatedly afterwards – in some cases for as long as five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the MRI scans, we asked patients to move different body parts: tapping their individual fingers, curling their toes or pursing their lips. This allowed us to map brain activity and to construct the brain's body map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, we repeated the scans, this time asking them to move their missing (phantom) fingers. Phantom movements are not imaginary: most amputees continue to feel vivid sensations of their missing limbs, even though they are physically no longer there. Doing so gave us a rare opportunity to directly compare the brain's hand map before and after amputation in the same person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that, across all three patients, the map of the hand in the brain remained remarkably unchanged and did not get overwritten by other body parts, such as the face. This neural stability helps explain why so many amputees continue to feel their missing limbs so vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most amputees, however, phantom sensations are not neutral sensations; they are painful and described as burning, stabbing or itching. For years, the dominant explanation for these painful sensations came from the idea that the brain's body map has reorganised itself. In turn, this theory inspired therapies such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnPxKr1dMU0"&gt;mirror box therapy&lt;/a&gt;, virtual reality training, or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplcT2MjuEc"&gt;sensory-discrimination exercises&lt;/a&gt;, all aimed at fixing supposedly broken maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mirror-box therapy explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show the brain's body map is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; broken. This helps explain why these therapies consistently fail to outperform  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; treatments in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172345" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;. If the map remains intact, trying to fix it is a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The real culprit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, our results suggest we should look elsewhere, for example, in the nerves that are cut during surgery. Severed nerves can form tangled clusters that misfire signals back to the brain. New amputation surgical techniques are being developed to preserve nerve signalling and maintain stable connections to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings have important implications for developing prosthetic limbs and brain-computer interfaces. Invasive next-generation brain-computer interfaces can tap directly into the preserved map of the amputated body part to decode what movements are being attempted or even deliver electrical stimulation to the map to enable amputees to feel their missing limb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These technologies are in development and could, one day, restore natural and intuitive control and sensations of a prosthetic limb, by using the preserved body map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that our brains have a resilient model of the body that maintains the representations, even when the sensory input is lost.

            Now, researchers are trying to learn how many people have “young COPD,” meaning the condition is diagnosed before 50 years of age. “Young COPD” was present in 4.5% of adults under 50 in the population studied, a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fevidence.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FEVIDoa2400424&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027673942654%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=hl3YvrA1ft0R29S5HHFnpjPy8EhltzbCD0GIl16oaVg%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;NEJM Evidence&lt;/a&gt;​ found. The diagnosis was associated with a significantly elevated risk of hospitalization due to lower respiratory disease and an increased risk of death before 75.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            What is COPD, and what are the risk factors for developing this condition? And why might young COPD increase mortality risk? What should people with COPD do to improve their health outcomes?

            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; COPD is a &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcopd%2Fabout%2Findex.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027673958481%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=kuc7vI4Ze4XArjUT3Od%2F%2FmzpwbTeBsHJE05pklF1V1o%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;group of lung diseases&lt;/a&gt; that cause airflow limitation, making it difficult to breathe. The two most common types of COPD are emphysema, which occurs when the air sacs in the lungs are damaged and lose their ability to stretch and exchange oxygen, and chronic bronchitis, which is marked by long-term inflammation and narrowing of the airways, often with excess mucus and a persistent cough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

People who currently smoke or previously smoked have a higher chance of developing COPD. Other risk factors include exposure to secondhand smoke, polluted air or other environmental workplace hazards. In addition, individuals with a history of asthma and a family history of COPD are at higher risk for having COPD.

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does this new study define young COPD?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the study authors, previous researchers have used varying definitions of “young COPD.” For instance, some have included only those who have had a smoking history. This study used a more expansive definition to account for nonsmokers with COPD.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000g3b6ni3l9a371@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Specifically, individuals must meet three sets of criteria. The first is having a spirometry measurement showing airflow obstruction. Spirometry is a breathing test that measures how much air a person can exhale and how quickly, which helps determine whether the lungs are blocked or narrowed. The second is having either 10 or more &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cancer.gov%2Fpublications%2Fdictionaries%2Fcancer-terms%2Fdef%2Fpack-year&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674009427%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=XQUtwlel9G7Jm2Nj7pcKJzwY8d6t%2FWRGWAF4kJuH8kI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;pack years&lt;/a&gt; of smoking, or symptoms of cough, phlegm and trouble breathing. The third is age between 18 and 49 years old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What did the study show about the prognosis of people with the condition? &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers examined four groups of people who were already participating in other research studies. This is important because they were not selected based on smoking exposure or existence of respiratory illnesses; therefore, their health characteristics broadly reflected the overall US population. Using this definition, they determined that the prevalence of young COPD was 4.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeq2x478000j3b6n8fwnljcp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers then tracked outcomes of participants with young COPD compared with those without this condition. They found that premature mortality, defined as death before 75 years of age, was increased more than 1.4 times among those with young COPD. The likelihood of hospitalization or death due to chronic lung disease was more than 2.5 times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The first step is to be aware that they carry the diagnosis.

They may attribute a chronic cough to a persistent virus or shortness of breath to aging. Or they may think that because they never smoked, they can’t have COPD. This is not correct. While smoking is a major risk factor for developing COPD, according to the American Lung Association, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-disease-lookup%2Fcopd%2Fsymptoms-diagnosis%2Fearly-warning-signs%23%3A~%3Atext%3DThere%2520are%2520over%252016%2520million%2Cis%2520often%2520manageable%2520and%2520treatable.&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674111124%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=1ZL695cfj%2BmAk5QC2p3ME1Bs88DW2ChsMLmQZ212lTk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 4 people&lt;/a&gt; with COPD never smoked.

            Once someone is diagnosed with COPD, their physician or other primary care provider will recommend a combination of therapies. These include lifestyle changes, most notably quitting smoking. Other important steps may include staying physically active, reducing exposure to air pollution and secondhand smoke, and participating in &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lung.org%2Flung-health-diseases%2Flung-procedures-and-tests%2Fpulmonary-rehab&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C27f63e1e459840c696fc08dde1d5209d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638915027674160463%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=sDyGLhKRFiJLPllVdQokdh02oRFq3ecB74ShM%2Fd4sy0%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;pulmonary rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt;, which is a structured program of exercise, education and support designed to improve ease of breathing and overall quality of life.

            Making sure to stay up-to-date with vaccinations is essential, as people with COPD are at greater risk of serious illness if they were to contract respiratory illnesses.

These include bronchodilators that relax the airway muscles and anti-inflammatories that reduce inflammation and mucus production. Individuals with COPD should also be alert to early signs of infection. They may receive specific antiviral treatment, and antibiotics are often given if a bacterial infection is suspected since infections can quickly worsen breathing problems.

I developed this horrific electrical pulsating sensation throughout my body, 24/7.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said her symptoms worsened and she was soon unable to walk, and for the next four months could not tolerate light, sound or touch. Even hugs or conversations with her two children were painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Their voices cut through my brain like a knife,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brianne Dressen, then 39, received a single vaccine dose in AstraZeneca 's Utah trials in November 2020 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen told Daily Mail soon that after receiving the vaccine she had trouble walking and began experiencing pain in her arms and legs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In constant agony, she said she contemplated suicide, but with the support of family, the vaccine injured community, and her husband, Dr Brian Dressen, she pulled through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dressen said she still suffers from 20 different symptoms, including autoimmune nerve damage known as chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy, and alleged in her lawsuit that AstraZeneca refused to comply with its contractual obligations to care for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she experiences fatigue, an internal buzzing sensation, weakness in her arms and legs, which means she sometimes needs a wheelchair, tinnitus, nausea, a weak bladder, food allergies and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), an irregular heartbeat and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dressen has a PhD in chemistry and wrote to neurologists trying to find answers for his wife's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he was surprised when neuroimmunology specialist Dr Avindra Nath, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the NIH, replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nath wanted to explore whether Dr Dressen's wife was suffering from a vaccine injury. When he set up a trial to test for Covid vaccine injury, she was the first enrolled in June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, the NIH diagnosed Dressen with post-vaccine neuropathy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 12 months following her trial vaccination, Dressen says she endured 60 doctors appointments, four emergency department visits, and one hospital admission. She said medical bills began to mount, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen told this website she was in so much pain that she contemplated suicide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen said her symptoms were so severe even hugs or conversations with her two children were painful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dressen said she still suffers from 20 different symptoms, including autoimmune nerve damage known as chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She reached out to AstraZeneca for financial assistance based on the contract she signed, which stated that the trial's 'sponsor will pay the costs of medical treatment for research injuries, provided that the costs are reasonable, and you did not cause the injury yourself.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dressen said AstraZeneca offered only a tiny fraction of the cost to cover expenses. She said they offered to increase the amount if she agreed to absolve them of any future liability. She refused the offers as she said they were derisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has a growing medical bill and is suing AstraZeneca for alleged breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca did not respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment but filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied, so they launched an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the Public Readiness and Preparedness (PREP) Act 2005, was set up to provide immunity to companies making vaccines when a public health emergency has been declared, as was the case during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It prevents the injured from suing unless a lawyer can prove there is evidence of willful misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For serious injury or death caused by emergency use vaccines, people must apply within 12 months for compensation to the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) set up in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CICP is a no-fault government program run by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) that covers emergency use products, like the Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kleiton Luis de Oliveira Souza, then 24, said he developed epilepsy after his second Covid vaccine in November 2020 in an AstraZeneca trial&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It pays for hospital costs not covered by insurance, lost wages up to $50,000, and just over $400,000 for a death, but most claims have been denied. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr criticized the scheme and said: 'It is broken, and I intend to fix it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By June 1, 2025, the CICP had received 13,836 claims from trial volunteers and citizens for Covid vaccine injuries, with 9,423 still pending review. It has paid just 39, denying 4,338 – with 2,318 rejected because claimants missed the 12-month deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While experts agree patients' symptoms should never be dismissed, they stress that they believe Covid vaccine injuries are overall rare and estimate the shots have prevented millions of hospitalizations and deaths worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid vaccine side effects impact around one in 200,000 people, according to official US data. Approximately 270million Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mRNA vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer are estimated to have saved tens of millions of lives globally, including 3million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, however, Yale researchers discovered a syndrome linked to the Covid vaccines. The previously-unknown condition - dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome' - appears to cause brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale experts emphasized the results 'are still a work in progress,' but based on the results of the small study, more research on post-vaccination syndrome is needed, independent experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another AstraZeneca trial, two British volunteers collapsed, having developed transverse myelitis, a serious nervous system disorder that can cause paralysis. The trials were temporarily halted in September 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were restarted six days later in the UK, by mid-September in Brazil, and by October in the US after an investigation determined the vaccine was not to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca also ran a trial at the Federal University of São Paolo, Brazil, with 5,000 volunteers. Student pharmacologist and gym enthusiast, Kleiton Luis de Oliveira Souza, 24, took part and developed epilepsy after his second Covid vaccine in November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A type 1 diabetic, he was deemed fit to take part in the trial, but Souza said he developed Covid-like symptoms after his first dose on October 16, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Souza is a type 1 diabetic, but he was deemed fit to take part in the trial for AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Souza said: 'Doctors concluded the vaccine must have caused my injuries'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid tests came back negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his second injection, he developed encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, and suffered a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza told DailyMail.com: 'My family took me to hospital. I was released after an overnight stay. I went home, had breakfast and went to bed. I collapsed in my bedroom, and my family took me back to hospital. I woke up three weeks later, having been sedated all that time, and spent two months in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While I was in the coma, neurologists investigated whether other viruses or bacteria caused my seizures but found no infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Since there was no other identified cause before the vaccination, they requested the unblinding of the vaccine trial and discovered I had not received the placebo, which was the meningitis vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctors concluded the vaccine must have caused my injuries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza will need medication for life to control his epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AstraZeneca refused to recognize his injury and provided no medical assistance according to Souza, so in 2021, Souza filed a civil suit in Bahia state court seeking financial compensation for alleged pain, suffering, emotional distress, financial losses and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Souza is bitter, he said. He told DailyMail.com: 'I was treated like a disposable number.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he met with AstraZeneca's lawyers twice, but they failed to offer a reasonable settlement. AstraZeneca has denied any wrongdoing. The case is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another part of the world for another Covid vaccine, criminal lawyer Augusto Roux, 40, took part in Pfizer's trial in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and said he suffered a serious adverse reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer conducted its largest Covid vaccine study there, with 5,700 volunteers representing 10 percent of Pfizer's worldwide trial participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Augusto Roux, then 36, took part in Pfizer's Covid vaccine trial in Buenos Aires, Argentina in August 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He told the Daily Mail he developed a high fever that persisted for weeks after receiving his second dose of Pfizer's Covid vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was run by the Argentine military at Hospital Militar Central – Central Military Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux, who was 36 at the time, received his first Pfizer dose in August 2020 with no complications. However, after his second dose the following month, he said he was near death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux, sharing the experience he lays out in his complaint, told the Daily Mail: 'I developed a 104-degree Fahrenheit [40C] fever which lasted several weeks; loss of consciousness, and tachycardia that could have killed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I now have pericarditis [inflammation of the sac around the heart] and liver damage, but trial doctors ignored these symptoms and questioned my mental health. Pfizer did not want to investigate my reaction and suggested I was infected with coronavirus, but all coronavirus tests were negative.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he immediately reported his symptoms to Pfizer and to Pfizer's principal trial investigator in Argentina, Dr Fernando Pedro Polack, who diagnosed Roux's illness as mental health issues. However, Dr Polack is not a mental health provider and is a pediatric infectious disease specialist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Pedro Polack did not respond to Daily Mail's request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux thinks treating his injuries have cost around $150,000 so far, paid for by health insurance, despite a contract with Pfizer that said he would be covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor David Healy, a pharmacologist trained to assess adverse drug reactions, was one of four doctors who assessed Roux's physical and mental health, at Roux's request. He acted pro bono.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told the Daily Mail: 'Roux had a significant injury linked to the vaccine and the failure to recognize this in his trial record amounts to a breach of good clinical trial practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It does not appear that Roux's injuries have been registered. If the trial is misleading in Roux's case, in how many other cases of people vaccinated in Buenos Aires has this also been the case?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roux said he immediately reported his symptoms to Pfizer and to Pfizer's principal trial investigator in Argentina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Roux said he now has pericarditis [inflammation of the sac around the heart] and liver damage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux said: 'I realized that they had deleted records of my adverse events a year later when I accessed my medical records and they weren't there.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A criminal case has now been launched by Roux alleging Pfizer, and the officials in charge of the trial, are guilty of abuse of power, failing to protect him, failing in public duty, bribery and corruption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He alleges the regulatory and judicial authorities suppressed adverse event reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2021, Argentina's Federal Chamber, similar to the Federal Court of Appeals, requested a formal investigation into trial irregularities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roux's investigations led to the Independent Ethics Committee of the Military Hospital (CIREC) being suspended for 90 days on May 20, 2021, by Dr Laura Antonietti, Director of Medical Education and Research, a senior Argentine Ministry of Health Official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also offered to investigate but did not follow through, although they did conduct preliminary enquiries and said they were happy the trial was following good clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pfizer told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'Patient safety is paramount and we take any reports of adverse events very seriously. Adverse event reports do not imply causality, and in the context of vaccination such events may be unrelated to administration of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Hundreds of millions of doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally and the benefit-risk profile of the vaccine remains positive for all authorized indications and age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As with every medicine and vaccine, including the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Pfizer has robust processes to meet its regulatory responsibilities to closely monitor, report and analyze all adverse events, and collect relevant information to assess any new potential safety risks that may be associated with the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In addition to our pharmacovigilance efforts and compliance with regulatory requirements related to quality and safety, we also work with regulatory authorities around the world as they independently monitor the safety profile of our vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients who receive the COVID-19 vaccine should talk to their doctor, pharmacist or nurse if they have any concerns or experience any side effects. This includes any possible side effects not listed in the package leaflet.

    &lt;p&gt;We’re firmly still in the summer months but many of us have been struck with symptoms we’d usually associate with the winter – runny noses, dry coughs and fevers. Right now, chances are these symptoms are caused by Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levels of the pandemic-causing virus are among the highest they have been all year. Here, the scientists explain exactly why Covid is on the rise again and, vitally, how to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why do so many people have Covid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Infection rates always go up because of one of three reasons,” says Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s either because immunity to Covid among the population has fallen; a new and more infectious variant is spreading; or behaviour has changed in a way that increases the risk of exposure to the virus, he explains. All three factors are currently at play, to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Immunity against Covid is low&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid cases are no longer being tracked as thoroughly as they were during the pandemic, when tests were dished out for free. However, monitoring shows that cases are currently at their highest level this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures, compiled by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), show that around nine per cent of all Covid tests taken in the week to August 24 were positive, which is the highest level seen since last November. The figures show that 10.8 per cent of people tested in GP practices were infected, while 8.8 per cent of swabs among hospital patients were positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reporting rates have been around base levels for almost a year now and so population immunity will be relatively low,” Prof Hunter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After becoming infected with Covid, the immune system develops antibodies against it. These are fighter cells that recognise and neutralise the virus when the body comes into contact with it again. “Immunity to infection probably lasts only a few months on average,” Prof Hunter notes, after which point the body is once again vulnerable to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that is probably the major factor,” fuelling the current upward trend in infections, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The new XFG variant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;XFG, a sub-variant of the once infamous Omicron, was first &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; in January. This strain of the virus, which has been nicknamed Stratus, is currently responsible for that majority of Covid cases in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant is also responsible for around 60 per cent of Covid cases globally, according to the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/summary"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is actively monitoring XFG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has become dominant because it is more infectious (able to bypass existing immunity to some degree) than prior variants,” explains Prof Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But its relative growth advantage is only about 31 per cent, which is not great compared to many previous variants,” he notes. For comparison, the Omicron variant, which caused chaos when it swept the world in late 2021, had a growth advantage of around 200 per cent when it emerged. “So it will be contributing to the growth in cases but I suspect not the main driver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Covid infections are now asymptomatic in many people, there have been reports that an XFG infection may be more likely to cause a hoarse, scratchy or raspy voice. Other common symptoms are still a cough, fever and change of taste or smell, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have seen the comments on hoarseness but given we see and diagnose such a small proportion of infections now and then usually only the more severe cases, I am not convinced,” Prof Hunter says. “Also adenoviruses [a cause of the common cold] are almost as common in lab tests and they do cause hoarseness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Summer socialising, travel and schools reopening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summer events, such as festivals and large gatherings like weddings, are “inevitably contributing” to the rise in cases, according to Prof Peter Openshaw, a respiratory physician and mucosal immunologist at Imperial College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increased foreign travel during the school holidays will also be contributing to the increase,” Prof Hunter adds. His &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299714"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has linked travelling abroad with an increased risk of catching Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, looking back over the pattern of transmissions, it does seem that maybe going back to school could be associated with a rise,” Prof Openshaw notes. Schools opening in early September could further encourage the spread of the virus, meaning that, by October, cases are even higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It may be that during October we’re going to be seeing a lot more Covid around,” he says. “There was quite a peak in October 2024 and then it settled around Christmas time and was replaced by influenza. It could be that we’re going to see more cases but I think we’ll have to wait and see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The big question is how high will reporting levels go and when they will peak,” Prof Hunter adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to avoid it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of isolating yourself at home, there’s unfortunately no magic bullet that will guarantee that you won’t catch Covid or other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regular hand washing and sanitising communal surfaces, such as trays on aeroplanes and trays, as well as gym equipment can reduce your risk of becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most of us, the need to avoid infection is not as great as we will have had multiple infections by now and most infections are asymptomatic,” Prof Hunter says. “On average in England, we will have had about four infections each by now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, older and medically vulnerable people should remain more cautious, he says. “Wear masks if in crowded environments, accept the offer of a vaccine if made and discourage visits from people who are suffering from a respiratory infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid autumn vaccination booster programme launches on October 1. Care home residents, over-75s and anyone aged over six months who is immunocompromised is eligible for the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccines that are on offer are extraordinarily effective,” Prof Openshaw says. “If you’re offered a vaccine, I would definitely take it and I personally have taken every offer of the vaccines I’ve been made.” The jab can reduce the likelihood of outbreaks and prevent the virus from causing serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What to do if you get Covid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, the most effective way to get over Covid is to rest at home and drink plenty of fluids and remain vigilant for worsening symptoms,” says Dr Adrian Hayter, medical director for clinical policy at the Royal College of General Practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the counter medications – paracetamol or ibuprofen – can help alleviate symptoms such as aches, a sore throat or a blocked nose, and increasing airflow by sitting upright and breathing slowly can help with feelings of breathlessness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a small group of people remain eligible for antivirals, which are medicines that stop Covid from growing and spreading through the body, including those who have certain immune conditions, blood disorders or receiving specific cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone has concerns for their health, or if their condition is getting worse or not improving, they should seek health advice to determine whether further treatment is needed,” Dr Hayter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advises people with Covid symptoms to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for at least three days, while the infected should steer clear of people who have a weak immune system for 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The condition is highly infectious, and some people can be particularly vulnerable to the worst effects, which is why it’s important that we take appropriate measures to avoid transmission,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common painkillers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen may fuel antibiotic resistance, raising urgent questions about drug interactions in aged care and beyond.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol) are among the most widely used pain and fever remedies, but new findings from the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-south-australia/"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt; suggest they may be contributing to a global health crisis: antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pioneering study, scientists discovered that each drug on its own can encourage bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics, and when taken together, they appear to intensify this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining how these medicines interact with the common antibiotic ciprofloxacin and &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;) – a bacterium often responsible for gut and urinary tract infections – the team observed that ibuprofen and acetaminophen accelerated genetic changes, making the bacteria more resistant not only to ciprofloxacin but also to other types of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this raises significant concerns for vulnerable groups, especially older adults in residential care facilities where multiple medications are commonly prescribed. The findings highlight the need for greater caution around everyday drug use and its potential role in worsening antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization reports that antimicrobial resistance is a global threat to public health, and that bacterial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are two of the most widely used over-the-counter pain relievers. Ibuprofen, sold under brand names like Advil and Motrin, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain, fever, and inflammation. Acetaminophen, best known by the brand name Tylenol, is commonly used to relieve pain and reduce fever but does not have anti-inflammatory effects. Both are staples in household medicine cabinets and are often considered go-to remedies for headaches, colds, and everyday aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1621" data-end="1661"&gt;Polypharmacy and Its Consequences&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher UniSA’s Associate Professor Rietie Venter says the findings raise important questions about the risks of polypharmacy in aged care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotics have long been vital in treating infectious diseases, but their widespread overuse and misuse have driven a global rise in antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” Assoc Prof Venter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is especially prevalent in residential aged care facilities, where older people are more likely to be prescribed multiple medications – not just antibiotics, but also drugs for pain, sleep, or blood pressure – making it an ideal breeding ground for gut bacteria to become resistant to antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we looked at the effect of non-antibiotic medicines and ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic which is used to treat common skin, gut, or urinary tract infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and paracetamol, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria’s defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Broader Medication Review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study assessed nine medications commonly used in residential aged care: ibuprofen (an anti-inflammatory pain relief), diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory to treat arthritis), acetaminophen (paracetamol for pain and fever), furosemide (for high blood pressure), metformin (for high sugar levels linked to Diabetes), atorvastatin (to help lower cholesterol and fats in the blood), tramadol (a stronger pain medication post-surgery), temazepam (used to treat sleeping problems), and pseudoephedrine (a decongestant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assoc Prof Venter says the study shows how antibiotic resistance is a more complex challenge than previously understood, with common non-antibiotic medications also playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic resistance isn’t just about antibiotics anymore,” Assoc Prof Venter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications – particularly in aged care, where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This doesn’t mean we should stop using these medications, but we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics – and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are calling for further studies into drug interactions among anyone on long-term medication treatment regimes so we can gain a greater awareness of how common medications may impact antibiotic effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remembering past events in minute detail, revisiting them methodically, and reliving past emotions—this is the peculiarity of people with an exceptional memory of their own lives, known as autobiographical hypermnesia, or hyperthymesia. This fascinating condition remains poorly understood, and each new case contributes to our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Neurocase&lt;/i&gt;, researchers from Paris Brain Institute and the Memory, Brain, and Cognition Laboratory describe the extraordinary mental life of a 17-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autobiographical memory refers to our ability to remember experiences that have shaped our lives since childhood. It consists of emotional and sensory memories of places, moments, and people, as well as a set of factual information—such as names and dates—that allows us to orient ourselves when we try to recall an episode from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, these memories are more or less vivid depending on how old they are or how much importance we attach to them. Thanks to the dynamic nature of memory, they lose sharpness over time, fade away completely, or are partially rewritten. But a small number of people—only a handful of cases have been described in scientific literature—have access to such a wealth of autobiographical details that they can link specific events to any given date on the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In these individuals, known as hyperthymesics, memories are carefully indexed by date. Some will be able to describe in detail what they did on July 6, 2002, and experience again the emotions and sensations of that day," explains Valentina La Corte, a research professor at the Memory, Brain, and Cognition Laboratory at Paris Cité University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having memories of our lives allows us to construct a narrative of ourselves and stabilize our sense of identity. Autobiographical memory is therefore associated with a type of consciousness called "autonoetic," which allows us to take a mental journey through time to relive past events, project ourselves into the future, or into imaginary situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperthymestic people can travel through time in their minds with extraordinary ease and intensity. "Studying this atypical cognitive functioning could help us better understand how autobiographical memory works, as well as the neurological disorders that affect it," says Laurent Cohen, neurologist and co-head of the PICNIC Lab at Paris Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A memory palace for organizing memories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to case reports in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/scientific+literature/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific literature&lt;/a&gt; and accounts in the media, hyperthymesia is often described as a distressing ability: painful, even traumatic memories can accumulate uncontrollably. Some individuals also feel overwhelmed by useless anecdotal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, La Corte and Cohen examined the case of TL, a 17-year-old girl who appears to have significant control over how she accesses her memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL distinguishes between two types. On the one hand, her "black memory" corresponds to encyclopedic knowledge mainly acquired at school and carries no particular emotional meaning. On the other hand, the memories of her life are organized within a sophisticated mental space—a kind of memory palace—that she can visualize on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are filed by theme and chronological order in binders, which are kept in a room with a very low ceiling that she calls "the white room." TL mentally scans through them to retrieve episodes related to her family life, vacations, friends, or childhood objects. Some memories are even stored in the form of text messages or photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl uses mental representation tools to isolate memories linked to negative emotions such as sadness, grief, or distress. For instance, her grandfather's death is kept in a chest inside the white room. She also uses two adjoining rooms: a "pack ice" room she uses to soothe her anger, a "problems" room to reflect on difficulties, and a "military room" populated by soldiers, which appeared in her mind when her father left home to join the army.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Assessing autobiographical memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers lack robust tools to verify whether hyperthymestic memories are reliable, especially when they concern distant periods. Like the rest of the population, hyperthymestics are prone to false memories and memory distortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, La Corte and Cohen used the Episodic Test of Autobiographical Memory (&lt;a href="https://loterre.istex.fr/P66/fr/page/-KN71C2N1-W" target="_blank"&gt;TEMPau&lt;/a&gt;) and the Temporal Extended Autobiographical Memory Task (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053810014001251?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;TEEAM&lt;/a&gt;), which assess how easily people can mentally travel through time, the richness of the memories they report, and how they relate to their own narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings indicate that TL relives moments of her life with exceptional intensity and vividness. Sometimes, as an external observer, sometimes as a protagonist, she can re-examine details from different points of view. When researchers asked her to imagine future events, she provided an unusually rich amount of temporal, spatial, and perceptual information, far beyond what an ordinary person can produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These observations reinforce the idea that mental travel into the future relies on mechanisms similar to those used in conscious exploration of the past. In both cases, sensory information seems to play a crucial role.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;New avenues for research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autobiographical hypermnesia also seems closely linked to synesthesia, a neurological condition in which processing one sensory modality involves at least two senses. For example, synesthetes may hear colors, see sounds, or taste music. Even though TL is not a synesthete, several members of her family are. It would be interesting to explore this association," adds Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that hyperthymesia is associated with overactivation of brain networks involved in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/autobiographical+memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autobiographical memory&lt;/a&gt; and certain visual areas. However, no neuroanatomical differences have yet been found between hyperthymesics and individuals with typical memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is difficult to generalize findings about hyperthymesia, since they rely on only a few cases. Does aging affect the memories of these individuals? Do their mental time-travel abilities depend on age? Can they learn to control the accumulation of memories? We have many questions, and everything remains to be discovered. An exciting avenue of research lies ahead," concludes La Corte.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Two people have died after eating Louisiana oysters infected with a&lt;a href="/article/news/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-louisiana-department-of-health-warns-of-potentially-deadly-infection/289-3b175c98-a155-4fde-abc4-505ab7582383"&gt; flesh eating bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. WBRZ reports the oysters were harvested in Louisiana before being served at restaurants in both Louisiana and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials said 14 others were also infected with Vibrio vulnificus&lt;em id="isPasted"&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a serious bacterial infection, after eating the oysters, &lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/two-more-people-dead-after-eating-louisiana-oysters-infected-with-flesh-eating-bacteria"&gt;our partners reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, Vibrio vulnificus has caused 34 infections and six deaths — the highest total Louisiana has seen in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just prolific right now,” said Jennifer Armentor, molluscan shellfish program administrator with the Louisiana Department of Health. She shared the update during a meeting with the Louisiana Oyster Task Force on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seafood businesses said the state enforces strict harvesting and safety protocols. Restaurants are also required by law to post warnings about the risks of eating raw oysters and seafood.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions that can help keep you safe according to the Louisiana Department of Health:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay out of brackish or salt water if you have a wound (including cuts and scrapes), or cover your wound with a waterproof bandage if there's a possibility it could come into contact with brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash wounds and cuts thoroughly with soap and water if they have been exposed to brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you develop a skin infection, tell your medical provider if your skin has come into contact with brackish or salt water, raw seafood, or raw seafood juices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use caution when consuming raw or undercooked seafood, especially if you have a weakened immune system, are pregnant, or have certain medical conditions like liver or stomach disorders. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always wash your hands with soap and water after handling raw shellfish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid contaminating cooked seafood with raw seafood and their juices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are in a group at higher risk for severe infection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear clothes and shoes that can protect you from cuts and scrapes when in brackish or salt water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear protective gloves when handling raw seafood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists are making encouraging progress in developing vaccines to treat  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172285" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but so far the therapies have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-vaccine-for-two-deadly-cancers-shows-promise-in-clinical-trial"&gt;restricted to specific types of tumor&lt;/a&gt;. Now new research points the way to a universal vaccine that could attack a wider range of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research led by a team at the University of Florida focuses on "&lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/surprising-finding-could-pave-way-for-universal-cancer-vaccine"&gt;waking up&lt;/a&gt;" the immune system to better respond to more types of cancerous cell – tumors that would otherwise be missed for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we found is by using a vaccine designed not to target cancer specifically but rather to stimulate a strong immunologic response, we could elicit a very strong anti-cancer reaction," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/surprising-finding-could-pave-way-for-universal-cancer-vaccine"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Duane Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-teas-temperature-could-put-you-at-risk-of-some-cancers"&gt;Your Tea's Temperature Could Put You at Risk of Some Cancers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And so this has significant potential to be broadly used across cancer patients – even possibly leading us to an off-the-shelf cancer vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine itself uses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA"&gt;mRNA&lt;/a&gt; to produce signaling proteins known to elicit a pronounced immune response, effectively mobilizing the immune system in a way that makes cancerous tissues more sensitive to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the materials created by the vaccine's mRNA weren't specific to the cancer tumors that were treated, but rather enhanced a reaction from dormant cells that weren't typically associated with a cancer response. It's like a one-size-fits-all siren for our body's border patrol – and that suggests it could have broad application potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172288" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/TumorGraph.jpg" alt="Tumour graph" class="wp-image-172288 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/TumorGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/TumorGraph-600x356.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172288" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The vaccine (uRNA) and anti-cancer drugs (PD-L1 mAb) had a significant impact on tumors. (Qdaisat et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Biomed. Eng.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second component to the treatment uses common anti-cancer drugs called immune &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_inhibitor"&gt;checkpoint inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; (ICIs). These essentially remove some of the brakes on the immune system, making it even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While ICIs have been successfully used against cancers in the past, tumors with numerous mutations can develop resistance to their attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When both the vaccine and the ICIs were used together on mice with tumors, the researchers saw a strong tumor-fighting response, even against cancerous growths that are normally resistant to treatments. Some tumors were eliminated entirely in the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the vaccine worked effectively on its own in certain scenarios, the best results were seen in combination with ICIs. The combined therapy still needs to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-helped-cancer-patients-live-40-longer-in-clinical-trial"&gt;tested in people&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172285" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to determine its effectiveness and safety, but the preclinical results suggest the approach is worth exploring further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding is a proof of concept that these vaccines potentially could be commercialized as universal cancer vaccines to sensitize the immune system against a patient's individual tumor," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/surprising-finding-could-pave-way-for-universal-cancer-vaccine"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; oncologist Elias Sayour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is already busy working on new formulations of their mRNA vaccine, and clinical trials are planned. This also needs to be tested in a wider range of scenarios – &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-discovery-of-elevated-cancer-risk-in-elite-runners-can-be-explained"&gt;preventing cancer&lt;/a&gt; from coming back, for example, as well as treating it when it's recently been found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might also be ways to recognize patients who would be more likely to benefit from this type of vaccine than others. Researchers are tackling the challenge of fighting cancer from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-holy-grail-protein-repairs-dna-and-could-lead-to-a-cancer-vaccine"&gt;multiple different angles&lt;/a&gt;, and we're probably going to need all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever tweaking the immune system is involved, there's always the danger of side effects and responses &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/immune-response-thought-to-aid-cancer-could-be-an-unexpected-cure"&gt;that eventually harm&lt;/a&gt; rather than help the body – but from the results so far, this new vaccine approach seems to be a promising one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could potentially be a universal way of waking up a patient's own immune response to cancer," &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/news/2025/surprising-finding-could-pave-way-for-universal-cancer-vaccine"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And that would be profound if generalizable to human studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01380-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="463" data-end="774"&gt;Case in point: The &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/The-Principles-of-the-Blue-Zone-Diet.aspx"&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt; (regions of the world where people routinely live past 90 in good health) all share one thing in common — a diet that’s largely plant-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="776" data-end="1031"&gt;But within the wide world of fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes, certain foods stand out for their ability to support healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="776" data-end="1031"&gt;Here are ten that doctors and nutrition experts consistently highlight — and easy ways to bring them to your table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1033" data-end="1053"&gt;1. Leafy greens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1055" data-end="1289"&gt;Spinach, kale, Swiss chard, arugula — doctors often group these under one umbrella: nature’s multivitamins. Rich in vitamin K, calcium, and antioxidants, leafy greens are particularly powerful for bone health and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1291" data-end="1524"&gt;Research published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29263222/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that people who regularly ate leafy greens experienced slower rates of cognitive decline compared to those who rarely did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1291" data-end="1524"&gt;That means your daily salad could be protecting your memory decades down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1526" data-end="1668"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1526" data-end="1537"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend spinach into smoothies, sauté kale with garlic, or toss arugula into grain bowls. The fresher and more varied, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1670" data-end="1685"&gt;2. Berries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1687" data-end="1910"&gt;Doctors often call berries “brain food,” and for good reason. Blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries are packed with anthocyanins — compounds that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, two major drivers of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1912" data-end="2087"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7442370/"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that regular berry consumption can improve memory and support heart health. They also deliver fiber, which helps maintain steady blood sugar and gut balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2089" data-end="2254"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2089" data-end="2100"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Add a handful of berries to oatmeal, yogurt alternatives, or even savory salads for a sweet-tart boost. Frozen berries are just as nutritious as fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2256" data-end="2271"&gt;3. Legumes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2273" data-end="2507"&gt;Beans, lentils, and chickpeas are staples in long-lived cultures around the world. Doctors love them because they provide plant-based protein, iron, and soluble fiber — which lowers cholesterol and supports a healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2509" data-end="2681"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6855964/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; links legume-rich diets to lower risks of heart disease and type 2 diabetes. They’re also affordable and versatile, making them a true backbone of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2683" data-end="2827"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2683" data-end="2694"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a lentil soup, chickpea salad, or black bean tacos. Cooking a large batch at once makes them easy to add throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2829" data-end="2851"&gt;4. Nuts and seeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2853" data-end="3113"&gt;Doctors consistently recommend nuts and seeds for longevity. They deliver healthy fats, vitamin E, and plant compounds that protect against cardiovascular disease. Almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds also support brain health and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3115" data-end="3314"&gt;One large &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/eating-nuts-reduces-risk-of-death/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that people who ate nuts daily had a 20% lower risk of dying from any cause over a 30-year period. That’s a remarkable return from something as simple as a handful of walnuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3115" data-end="3314"&gt;(And it's certainly welcome news for me, a certified nut addict!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3316" data-end="3447"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3316" data-end="3327"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Sprinkle seeds on oatmeal or salads, keep almonds on hand for snacks, or blend cashews into creamy dairy-free sauces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3449" data-end="3469"&gt;5. Whole grains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3471" data-end="3727"&gt;Whole grains like oats, quinoa, brown rice, and barley are linked to healthier hearts and longer lives. Doctors emphasize them because they’re rich in fiber, B vitamins, and magnesium — nutrients that support digestion, energy, and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3729" data-end="3919"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000001031"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, replacing refined grains with whole grains can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3921" data-end="4049"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3921" data-end="3932"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Build bowls around quinoa, swap white rice for brown, or keep overnight oats in the fridge for a simple breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4051" data-end="4081"&gt;6. Cruciferous vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4083" data-end="4324"&gt;Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, and cabbage are in a league of their own. Thanks to their sulforaphane content — a compound shown to help the body detoxify harmful substances and even protect against certain cancers — these veggies have earned a regular spot on many doctors’ “must-eat” lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="461" data-end="846"&gt;They’re also loaded with vitamin C, folate, and fiber, all of which support resilience as the body ages. Folate helps with cell repair and brain health, vitamin C protects skin and connective tissues, and fiber keeps digestion running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="461" data-end="846"&gt;It’s no wonder people who regularly include cruciferous vegetables in their diets are often found to have lower risks of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="848" data-end="1123"&gt;The best part? They’re incredibly versatile. Whether roasted until crispy, shaved raw into salads, or blended into soups, these vegetables adapt to just about any cuisine. Making them a staple doesn’t have to feel like a chore — it can actually make meals more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1125" data-end="1285"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1125" data-end="1136"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Make a quick broccoli pesto for pasta, toss shredded cabbage into tacos, or roast Brussels sprouts with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic glaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4652" data-end="4688"&gt;7. Dark chocolate (yes, really)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4690" data-end="4957"&gt;Doctors often highlight dark chocolate — in moderation — as a surprisingly beneficial food for aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4690" data-end="4957"&gt;High-quality, minimally processed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9589144/"&gt;dark chocolate contains flavonoids&lt;/a&gt; that support heart health, reduce inflammation, and may even improve circulation to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4959" data-end="5128"&gt;It’s also a mood booster, which matters just as much for longevity as physical health. The key is to choose varieties with at least 70% cacao and keep portions modest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5130" data-end="5272"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5130" data-end="5141"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoy a square of dark chocolate with tea, melt it over fruit, or add cacao powder to smoothies for a rich, nutrient-dense kick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5274" data-end="5290"&gt;8. Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="107" data-end="399"&gt;Here’s good news for anyone who loves pasta sauce or a simple tomato salad: tomatoes are one of the most powerful foods you can eat for healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="107" data-end="399"&gt;They’re packed with lycopene, an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC80172/"&gt;antioxidant linked&lt;/a&gt; to stronger heart health, sharper vision, and protection against cell damage over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="401" data-end="630"&gt;Even better, cooking actually boosts their benefits. Lycopene becomes more available to the body when tomatoes are simmered or roasted, so dishes like tomato soup or marinara aren’t just comforting — they’re quietly protective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="632" data-end="789"&gt;Add in their vitamin C and potassium content, and tomatoes prove that an everyday ingredient can punch far above its weight in supporting long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="791" data-end="906"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="791" data-end="802"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Blend roasted tomatoes into soups, simmer them into stews, or enjoy fresh cherry tomatoes as a snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5809" data-end="5826"&gt;9. Mushrooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5828" data-end="6110"&gt;Doctors often highlight &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-mushrooms"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; for their immune-boosting properties and unique compounds like beta-glucans and ergothioneine, an antioxidant that helps protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5828" data-end="6110"&gt;Some varieties, such as shiitake and maitake, are also known for supporting cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6112" data-end="6283"&gt;And here’s the kicker: mushrooms are one of the few plant-based sources of vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, making them especially valuable for bone health as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6285" data-end="6420"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6285" data-end="6296"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Sauté mushrooms as a savory side, add them to stir-fries, or roast them until crisp for a meaty, nutrient-packed topping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6422" data-end="6445"&gt;10. Sweet potatoes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="142" data-end="392"&gt;Few comfort foods carry as much nutritional power as sweet potatoes. Beneath their natural sweetness lies a storehouse of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A — essential for protecting vision and supporting a strong immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="394" data-end="686"&gt;They also deliver fiber and complex carbohydrates that release energy slowly, keeping blood sugar steady and fueling the body without spikes and crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="394" data-end="686"&gt;In many long-lived cultures, root vegetables like sweet potatoes are everyday staples, forming the base of nourishing, affordable meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="688" data-end="874"&gt;Their versatility is another reason they shine. Sweet potatoes can go savory or sweet, mashed or roasted, side dish or centerpiece — always satisfying and always packed with nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="876" data-end="1014"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="876" data-end="887"&gt;Try it:&lt;/strong&gt; Bake sweet potato wedges, mash them with a drizzle of olive oil, or slice them into thin rounds for quick, oven-free toasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6985" data-end="7004"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthy aging doesn’t come down to a single superfood or a rigid diet plan. It’s about weaving small, consistent choices into the fabric of daily life — the kind of choices that keep your heart strong, your memory sharp, and your meals joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes these ten foods remarkable is that they aren’t exotic or inaccessible. They’re simple ingredients you can find at any grocery store, each carrying a quiet power to support the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of chasing the next big wellness trend, consider reaching for what’s already familiar: a handful of nuts, a bowl of lentils, a roasted sweet potato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because often, the path to a long and vibrant life isn’t about reinventing how we eat — it’s about appreciating the foods that have been nourishing us all along.&lt;/p&gt;

The first is in your chest. The second is in your calves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Every step, every heal raise, every muscle squeeze pushes blood back to your real heart, keeps your circulation alive, and stops deadly clots from forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But here's the problem. Our modern lifestyle is killing it. We sit for hours. We walk less than ever. We lose muscle as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US-based cardiologist Dr Dmitry Yaranov has warned that moving around more each day, even just for minutes at a time, could vastly reduce the odds of suffering 'deadly clots', which raise the risk of heart issues &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When your "second heart" fails, your first one is forced to work harder—circulation slows, swelling begins, blood pressure rises, and your risk of heart failure skyrockets.'   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Move. Walk daily. Do heel raises at your desk. Take the stairs. Keep your calf muscles strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Don't wait until it's too late—start today. Your future self will thank you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously studies have shown walking 10,000 steps a day can lower risk of heart disease, cancer and premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14937193/scientists-reveal-number-daily-steps-prevent-dementia.html"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has suggested just 7,000 steps a day was enough to lower risk of dementia, heart disease and some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have also suggested the pace we walk may be just as important.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, US scientists who studied more than 79,850 adults found a short brisk was more beneficial than walking at a slower pace for three hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a worrying &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14724297/heart-health-declining-record-rate.html"&gt;rise&lt;/a&gt; in heart-related deaths in the UK, which have soared 18 per cent from 18,693 to 21,975 between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation (BHF), there has also been a 21 per cent rise in the number of people being diagnosed with heart failure since 2020—the highest on record. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of people with atrial fibrillation—irregular heartbeat—has also increased to a record high—1.62 million up from 1.48 million over the same time period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BHF analysis also revealed an 83 per cent rise in the number of people waiting for planned heart hospital treatment in England, from the start of the decade to March 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiac waiting lists have also grown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The BHF said the concerning shift follows decades of progress that had seen annual deaths from conditions like a heart attack and stroke half since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity suggested the rise could be driven by a rise in processed foods and unhealthy diets, the impact of Covid infections on the heart and circulatory system as well as disruption to routine and GP appointments and heart care services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:19:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNWFR3bXZqM1RKaWl5NGk0Ny15cG1NbEFFUUpVMVdSVGVGbTB0R1lZekRRdTkyNVF0X1VrcDZ3amh2VnJxcFJ1cW1oV1o0WVhYTENsUnlKa1NwSl9pWXB0TzhMXzR2ZTZwQ0dmQ2twVzI0QnRwa1pnazBoZHJKbWtTaUJPMFAxS3FOMm5mb1I2RDdra1Fwbm1IN0E3WDBiZ1FaUjFRQV8yU3QwSGw2QkFR0gG0AUFVX3lxTE85Q0ZVZTdheUMwMG1fbk4yM1EtYU1vQWo0T3VJQUEwTzN6WlgzeWdaT3BxMFNxVDlEMTByaWRYWXd2MTBoZ2xxSDljcklNVk1PdGZlVElTbmM5VXFGQ0Qtek90YmVSVXBzSnpNYUhTOVFRdWkyNTZETGYyX1ZweEx3elFzQklwalJSaDhZVmtscnVLZG1FWHRUYzJpaU5JX2ZaYWdOd2U4WUhKUzNpTWlFMkJkRw</guid></item><item><title>科学所说的简单习惯会让年轻人更快乐-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/wellbeing-sleep-diet-exercise-university-otago-research-b2815712.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

a 13-day study of 818 New Zealand adults who were asked to keep a daily diary; and an eight-day diary study of 236 New Zealand adults who also wore Fitbits tracking physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better sleep quality was strongly associated with better mental wellbeing across all three studies, and eating fruit and vegetables came second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity was also linked to better wellbeing when researchers compared how an individual felt between days rather than when comparing a group of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also found that above-average intake of fruits and vegetables appeared to mitigate the effects of a poor night’s sleep, and a good night’s sleep appeared to protect against lower fruit and vegetable intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dzgyhB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/21/13/35/iStock-1511686062.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/21/13/35/iStock-1511686062.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/21/13/35/iStock-1511686062.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Boosting fruit and vegetable intake could potentially help mitigate the negative effects a poor night’s sleep has on mental health" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-4966"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Boosting fruit and vegetable intake could potentially help mitigate the negative effects a poor night’s sleep has on mental health&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author Professor Tamlin Conner, of the University of Otago psychology department, said: “Understanding what lifestyle factors support wellbeing can help young adults not just ‘get by’ but thrive during this critical life stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of these healthy habits, sleep quality stood out as the strongest and most consistent predictor of next-day wellbeing, but eating fruit and vegetables and being active also helped boost wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This age group faces unique pressures – such as leaving home, financial stress, educational pressures and social stressors – that can lower happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But getting plenty of sleep doesn’t just benefit mental health but brain function generally, especially in teenagers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate study of 3,000 young people by researchers at University of Cambridge and Fudan University in China found that those who got an early night, slept longer and had the lowest sleeping heart rates would outperform others on reading, vocabulary, problem solving and other mental tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS explained how age does play a role in how much sleep a person needs. While most healthy adults need seven to nine hours a night, teenagers, children and babies need more sleep because they are still growing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 10:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOTWxXckNCY2F0UWNVWGJHWFFyUXR6cGY5TVVmSjNQSEtRZmNlOXpBcnA4Vy14aUxmS3R1MmpEQl9tcW45eWI3NjVDaXhjR1Y1c29fSXNGSEc5Y3lYSnJKV3B5QmMxaVo3WGxRSGU1VmhVU0tqejJuaVJtWDJWRTQ3Zkh1SXl4Ul8zd3pndTZMNzhQbmwzRkpRTEsxQjJIekwxQmdQSzhheTdfX1hVR3RYQg</guid></item><item><title>夏洛特县在浣熊确诊病例后发出狂犬病警报- WINK新闻</title><link>https://www.winknews.com/news/charlotte/charlotte-county-issues-rabies-alert-after-case-from-raccoon/article_99f9a9f0-1f73-4f5b-b598-85088df3b10b.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

The CDC said it was assessing the outbreak's size and impact, noting that travel health notices alert people to risks and advise on prevention measures, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-30/cdc-weighs-travel-notice-for-china-as-chikungunya-cases-rise" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bloomberg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, the CDC has issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Level 2 alert;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Level 2 alert&lt;/a&gt;, meaning travelers should "practice enhanced precautions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Chikungunya, spread by Aedes mosquitoes, often causes a fever that comes on suddenly and severe joint pain, particularly in the hands and feet. The CDC warns that older adults are especially vulnerable, and recent safety reviews have paused use of the live-virus chikungunya vaccine in people over 60. With European regulators also reassessing its use, prevention hinges on bite protection — a challenge in densely populated, humid areas such as Guangdong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this chikungunya outbreak important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While outbreaks typically happen in tropical and subtropical regions, warmer global conditions are expanding mosquitoes' range. The World Health Organization issued a warning in July after similar outbreaks in Indian Ocean islands showed signs of escalating into an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This outbreak is yet another example of how rising global temperatures are helping to spread vector-borne diseases, especially as international travel moves them quickly across borders. Aedes mosquitoes can also carry dengue, Zika, and yellow fever — all illnesses that have reached record or near-record case counts in multiple regions over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While China doesn't have access to the two chikungunya vaccines that have been approved in the United States, its government has said it's employing preventative measures such as quarantining, spraying mosquito repellent with drones, and releasing fish into ponds to eat mosquito larvae, according to the Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The CDC's Level 2 advisory has been extended to &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nine countries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nine countries&lt;/a&gt; with chikungunya outbreaks. Some ways people can protect themselves include wearing long sleeves and pants, using insect repellent, and staying in places with screened or air-conditioned rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is a reminder that protecting public health will increasingly require quick outbreak responses as the planet continues to warm. In the long run, curbing heat-trapping pollution is the most important part of preventing these diseases from spreading more easily.

&lt;p id="23aaef1c-50c7-4298-8862-4f817de5e73c"&gt;If time was on my side, I'd start every day with a restorative hour-long vinyasa yoga class to alleviate tight muscles and maintain mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in lieu of that luxury, I've started using a series of quick stretches every morning when I roll out of bed—in an attempt to release tension that's been building up in my lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="23aaef1c-50c7-4298-8862-4f817de5e73c-2"&gt;The stretches are from a protocol known as the McKenzie Method of Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy or MDT, pioneered by Kiwi physiotherapist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mckenzieinstitute.org/patients/what-is-the-mckenzie-method/" target="_blank" data-url="https://mckenzieinstitute.org/patients/what-is-the-mckenzie-method/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Robin McKenzie&lt;/a&gt; over 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First put on my radar by US chiropractor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haley-ray-a80996b3/?trk=public_profile_browsemap" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/haley-ray-a80996b3/?trk=public_profile_browsemap" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Dr Haley Ray&lt;/a&gt;, the McKenzie Method involves seven exercises designed to gently encourage extension and flexion of the spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These exercises target the extensor muscles of the lower back, which can help reduce pain, promote healing and reduce the risk of future injury,” Ray told me for &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/use-these-seven-science-backed-stretches-to-treat-lower-back-pain-and-regain-mobility-at-home?hasComeFromProof=true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/flexibility/use-these-seven-science-backed-stretches-to-treat-lower-back-pain-and-regain-mobility-at-home?hasComeFromProof=true"&gt;routine involves seven exercises&lt;/a&gt; that should be performed in sequence depending on your level of pain and stiffness, but I've found joy from focusing on four of the moves in particular, practicing them first thing in the morning or last thing at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-the-exercises" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-exercises"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="e49f3d31-5342-4093-97c5-7f9dfdfecf2c"&gt;The exercises involve first lying on my front (prone position) and propping myself up onto my elbows in a move similar to the cobra pose in yoga, then rising up onto my hands to increase the backbend while keeping my hips grounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GmSiAuxZk9W4zxpp2QqvLR" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GmSiAuxZk9W4zxpp2QqvLR slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I'll roll over onto my back and hug my knees into my chest to flex my lower back and counteract the extension movements. Lastly, I'll stand tall and perform 5-10 slow forward folds, increasing my range with each rep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key for each exercise, and especially the prone extension moves, is to allow my lower back, glutes and legs to completely relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've been carrying so much tension in my lower back—likely due to aggravating the muscles earlier this year—that as a defence mechanism my body has tightened up the area to protect the spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as muscle guarding, this protective response occurs when the muscles tense up to limit movement around an injury, but prolonged guarding can cause longer-term weakness and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're nursing a tight lower back, I'd recommend you first consult your doctor or physician.

The reduction of body weight by 5% or more, leads to substantial blood pressure improvements and heart health benefits for diabetic patients. Let's find out more...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New Blood Pressure guidelines overview&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to new guidelines, adults must have blood pressure levels below 130/80 mm Hg for optimal health. The guidelines also promote lifestyle modifications that include salt reduction, together with limited alcohol intake, increased physical exercise and essential weight reduction to control blood pressure. The recommendations work to decrease the probabilities of heart attack, stroke, kidney damage and dementia development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even more important for diabetics&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with diabetes face elevated chances of developing hypertension, which leads to worse diabetes complications as well as higher heart disease probability. Blood pressure control stands as an essential diabetes management practice, because it protects blood vessels and organs from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weight Loss: A key strategy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines identify losing at least 5% of body weight as an essential method for blood pressure management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A weight loss of 5% results in a 5 mm Hg reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. This reduction improves heart health, and reduces the strain on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The specific advantages of weight loss for diabetic patients&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loss of 5-10% body weight provides diabetic patients with important health advantages, which extend beyond blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss enables the body to utilise insulin more effectively, thus it lowers blood sugar levels, and decreases the possibility of diabetes-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate weight reduction leads to significant blood pressure decreases that lower the risk of developing heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved Lipid Levels: Weight loss improves ‘good’ cholesterol (HDL) and lowers triglycerides, both important for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Research evidence supporting the guidelines&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Look AHEAD trial demonstrated that diabetic adults who lost between 5-10% of their body weight, achieved substantial improvements in blood sugar control (HbA1c reduction), blood pressure and blood fats. Research findings indicate that larger weight loss amounts produce more extensive advantages. The resulting modifications safeguard both heart health and kidney function, while leading to enhanced wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive effects of weight loss persist, even if some weight gain occurs in the future.

                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health says a wastewater sample collected this month tested positive for the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said in a news release today that the sample was collected Aug. 11 from a site in West Hawaii County and is the first wastewater detection of measles in the state. DOH was notified of the result on Aug. 26, and is monitoring for signs of an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, however, there have been no new reports of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the presence of measles virus in wastewater does not confirm a clinical case or community spread, but is a signal to be alert and prepared for possible measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The recent detection of measles virus in our wastewater is a reminder that this disease is still a threat,” said Gov. Josh Green in the news release. “Vaccination remains our strongest defense to stop measles before it spreads in Hawaii. Let’s work together to protect each other and keep our islands safe and healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state routinely collects and tests wastewater samples as part of disease surveillance, which &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2022/04/18/hawaii-news/monitoring-for-covid-in-hawaii-wastewater-expected-to-start-this-summer/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;became widespread&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to help track the presence of numerous pathogens, including COVID, avian influenza, and norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wastewater monitoring serves as an early-warning system for emerging outbreaks, as infected people begin shedding a virus in their waste in two to three days, regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, national wastewater surveillance companies began testing for measles as an &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/26/breaking-news/texas-measles-outbreak-worsened-as-cdc-silenced-under-trump/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;outbreak in Texas&lt;/a&gt; spread to other states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WastewaterSCAN began testing for measles in May, while NWSS-Verily did so in July, followed by Biobot Analytics in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hawaii has so far this year has only confirmed two measles cases. Both were confirmed in April before measles wastewater testing began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early April, DOH confirmed measles in an &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/hawaii-confirms-travel-related-measles-case-in-child-under-5/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;unvaccinated child&lt;/a&gt; under the age of 5 on Oahu. The child began developing symptoms after returning from international travel. About 10 days later, DOH confirmed a &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/17/breaking-news/hawaiis-2nd-measles-case-confirmed-in-household-member/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;second measles case&lt;/a&gt; in an adult member of the same household as the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No further measles cases were reported after the two in April, and state health officials said they are not related to this recent wastewater detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department, meanwhile, is urging everyone to stay up to date on the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/disease_listing/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Measles&lt;/a&gt; is highly contagious but preventable through vaccination,” health officials in the release. “Infants under 1 year of age are at particularly high risk because they are too young to be vaccinated, but in certain situations, vaccination may be recommended for children between 6 and 12 months if they are exposed to a known case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an MMR vaccine, families should contact their medical provider or pharmacy. Additionally, anyone who has traveled to an area with a current measles outbreak should consult a doctor upon developing symptoms, which include a fever, runny nose, and cough, followed by the spread of tiny, red spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of measles cases in the U.S has ramped up significantly this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, more than 1,400 measles cases have been confirmed in over 40 U.S. states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the highest number since measles was declared eliminated 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                                
                                
                                
                                                                
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

When we’re stressed and overwhelmed, we tend to gather clutter and misplace things. When we’re disconnected from people and purpose, communication diminishes, mail accumulates, and emails go unread. As &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/enlightened-living/200807/how-the-environment-we-create-is-a-reflection-of-our-state-of-mind" target="_blank"&gt;psychotherapist Michael J. Formica&lt;/a&gt; explains, a person’s home reflects their “global state of mind” — a mix of emotional, social, spiritual, and physical well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When seemingly superficial things like clutter and messes seem to run rampant at home, they can also be a sign of something deeper and more personal. If you notice these things at someone’s house, they’re struggling more than they admit. Even if some of these things are normal in the home of a well-functioning and happy person, they can also be connected to chronic stress, unhappiness, and general disarray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you notice these 11 things at someone’s house, they’re struggling more than they admit:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

If you make your bed in the morning and everything else in your day goes “wrong,” at least you have a comfortable, made bed to come home to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you usually see an unmade bed at someone else’s house, they might be struggling more than they let on — neglecting the simplest way to protect their mood and sanity just for a few more minutes of sleep or rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/small-things-you-can-do-morning-so-you-dont-want-get-back-bed-and-hide"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11 Small Things You Can Do In The Morning So You Don't Want To Get Back In Bed And Hide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conch shell blowing eased sleep apnea symptoms and improved sleep quality. The practice may provide a simple alternative to machines or medication.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small randomized controlled trial published in &lt;em&gt;ERJ Open Research&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals who practiced blowing through a conch shell for six months experienced improvements in their obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSA is a widespread sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops during the night because of airway obstruction. It is linked to loud snoring, poor-quality sleep, and excessive tiredness during the day, and it raises the risk of high blood pressure, &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;cardiovascular disease&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a range of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, heart attack, stroke, and hypertension. These conditions are primarily driven by atherosclerosis, a process where plaque builds up in the arterial walls, leading to narrowed or blocked arteries. Risk factors include smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, and genetic predisposition. CVD remains a leading cause of global mortality, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes, medical interventions, and preventive measures in managing and reducing the risk of heart-related illnesses.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conch shell blowing, also known as shankh blowing, has been a traditional practice in India for thousands of years. The study revealed that people with moderate OSA who engaged in shankh blowing reported better sleep, greater alertness during the day, and fewer nighttime breathing disruptions. According to the researchers, this practice may represent a simple, affordable approach to easing symptoms without relying on medication or medical devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Comparing with CPAP treatment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Krishna K Sharma at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India. He explained: “The standard treatment for OSA is a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, which prevents airway collapse by delivering air through a facemask during sleep. Although highly effective, many patients find it uncomfortable and have difficulty using it consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_491027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491027" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Dr-Krishna-K-Sharma.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-491027" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Dr-Krishna-K-Sharma.jpg" alt="Dr Krishna K Sharma" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Dr-Krishna-K-Sharma.jpg 777w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Dr-Krishna-K-Sharma-400x394.jpg 400w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Dr-Krishna-K-Sharma-768x757.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Dr-Krishna-K-Sharma-150x148.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Dr-Krishna-K-Sharma-450x444.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-491027" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Portrait of lead researcher Dr Krishna K Sharma.

&lt;p&gt;“In my clinical practice, several patients reported feeling more refreshed and noticing fewer symptoms after regularly engaging in shankh blowing – a traditional yogic breathing technique that involves exhaling into a conch shell. These reports prompted us to conduct a scientific study to carefully evaluate whether this ancient practice could provide a useful treatment option for people with OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial enrolled 30 individuals with moderate OSA, aged 19 to 65, who were evaluated at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute between May 2022 and January 2024. Participants underwent polysomnography, a test that records sleep activity throughout the night, and completed assessments about their sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Treatment groups and training&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 16 individuals were trained to practice blowing through a conch shell, while 14 were instructed in a deep breathing exercise. Eacpolysomnographyh person received a traditional shankh commonly used in yogic practices and was taught the technique in person at the clinic by a member of the study team before beginning at-home sessions. They were asked to practice for at least 15 minutes a day, five days a week. After six months of consistent practice, all participants were reassessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results showed clear differences between the two groups. Those who practiced shankh blowing reported feeling 34% less sleepy during the day, experienced better overall sleep, and had four to five fewer nightly apnea episodes (pauses in breathing during sleep) on average compared with the deep breathing group. They also maintained higher nighttime blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How shankh blowing may work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Sharma said: “The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive. It involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate – areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA. The shankh’s unique spiraling structure may also contribute to specific acoustic and mechanical effects that further stimulate and tone these muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For people living with OSA, especially those who find CPAP uncomfortable, unaffordable, or inaccessible, our findings offer a promising alternative. Shankh blowing is a simple, low-cost breathing technique that could help improve sleep and reduce symptoms without the need for machines or medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a small study, but we are now planning a larger trial involving several hospitals. This next phase will allow us to validate and expand on our findings in a broader, more diverse population and assess how shankh blowing performs over longer periods. We also want to study how this practice affects airway muscle tone, oxygen levels, and sleep in greater detail. We’re particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of OSA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Sophia Schiza, Head of the ERS group on sleep disordered breathing, based at the University of Crete, Greece, who was not involved in the research said: “Obstructive sleep apnea is a common disease around the world. We know that OSA patients have poor quality of sleep, and higher risks of high blood pressure, strokes, and heart disease. A proportion of patients experience sleepiness during the day. While CPAP and other treatments are available based on careful diagnosis of disease severity, there is still a need for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an intriguing study that shows the ancient practice of shankh blowing could potentially offer an OSA treatment for selected patients by targeting muscle training. A larger study will help provide more evidence for this intervention, which could be of benefit as a treatment option or in combination with other treatments in selected OSA patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A major new study reveals 3 simple lifestyle changes that can cut the risk of type 2 diabetes by nearly a third.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adopting a Mediterranean-style diet while also reducing daily calories, engaging in moderate physical activity, and receiving professional weight-loss support may lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) by 31%, according to new research led in part by scientists at the &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/harvard-university/"&gt;Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re facing a global epidemic of diabetes,” said co-author Frank Hu, Fredrick J. Stare Professor of Nutrition and Epidemiology and chair of the Department of Nutrition. “With the highest-level evidence, our study shows that modest, sustained changes in diet and lifestyle could prevent millions of cases of this disease worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have associated the Mediterranean diet, which centers on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, with moderate amounts of dairy and lean proteins and little to no red meat, with improved health outcomes. These benefits include lowering the risk of T2D by improving &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;insulin&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, crucial for regulating blood glucose levels. It helps cells in the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and convert it into energy or store it for future use. Insulin production and action are essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it does produce (Type 2 diabetes), leading to elevated levels of glucose in the blood. This can cause various health complications over time, including heart disease, kidney damage, and nerve dysfunction. Insulin therapy, where insulin is administered through injections or an insulin pump, is a common treatment for managing diabetes, particularly Type 1. The discovery of insulin in 1921 by Frederick Banting and Charles Best was a landmark in medical science, transforming diabetes from a fatal disease to a manageable condition.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;insulin&lt;/span&gt; sensitivity and reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers working on the PREDIMED-Plus clinical trial, the largest randomized study in Europe to examine diet and lifestyle, set out to determine how the Mediterranean diet’s advantages could be further strengthened by pairing it with additional healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Study Design and Participants&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, from 23 universities in Spain and Harvard Chan School, split 4,746 PREDIMED-Plus participants into an intervention group and a control group and followed their health outcomes for six years. The intervention group adhered to a Mediterranean diet; reduced their caloric intake by about 600 calories per day; engaged in moderate physical activity, such as brisk walking and strength and balance exercises; and received professional support for weight loss control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control group adhered to a Mediterranean diet without calorie restriction, exercise guidance, or professional support. Participants ranged from age 55 to 75, were overweight or obese, and had metabolic syndrome, but were free of T2D at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Results and Findings&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that those in the intervention group had a 31% lower risk of developing T2D compared to those in the control group. Additionally, the intervention group lost an average of 3.3 kilograms and reduced their waist circumference by 3.6 centimeters, compared to 0.6 kilograms and 0.3 centimeters in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In practical terms, adding calorie control and physical activity to the Mediterranean diet prevented around three out of every 100 people from developing diabetes—a clear, measurable benefit for public health,” said co-author Miguel Martínez-González, professor at the University of Navarra and adjunct professor of nutrition at Harvard Chan School.&lt;/p&gt;

That picture is mostly right, but it may be missing a a key component. According to &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1096050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, common mouth bacteria that usually stay in their lane may drift into the bloodstream and trigger heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that mouth microbes don’t just float through the bloodstream and disappear, as has always been understood to be the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may take up residence inside &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arterial plaque&lt;/a&gt; and help spark the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lifestyle-choices-in-young-adulthood-impact-cognitive-ability-in-midlife/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that makes a weak spot crack. That is the sort of crack that can set off a clot and cut off blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bacteria-and-heart-artery-plaques"&gt;Bacteria and heart artery plaques&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaques form inside blood vessels over time. They are made of fats, cholesterol, immune cells, and scar-like tissue. Many sit there without causing trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk rises when the thin outer layer – the fibrous cap – breaks. Once that cover fails, the plaque’s contents meet the bloodstream; &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/red-blood-cells-found-to-squeeze-clots-tight-using-physical-force/"&gt;a clot can form&lt;/a&gt;, and a heart attack can follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focused on whether bacteria from the mouth, especially a group called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/viridans-streptococci" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;viridans streptococci&lt;/a&gt;, could be tucked into those plaques. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central question was: were bacteria hiding out and then helping to drive inflammation right where it hurts most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed artery plaques from two sources: people who died suddenly and patients having surgery to clear clogged neck arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did not rely on one test. They used DNA methods to detect bacterial genetic traces, special stains to locate bacteria in tissue, and gene activity analyses to see which immune pathways were active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also tested how different bacterial components trigger early warning signals in immune cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pattern recognition receptors – the body’s “burglar alarms” – were a key focus, including a pathway called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/tlr2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR2&lt;/a&gt; that is well known for spotting bacterial signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biofilm-bacteria-and-the-heart"&gt;Biofilm bacteria and the heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the deeper parts of many plaques, the team found signs that viridans streptococci were living together as a biofilm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A biofilm is a community of bacteria embedded in a protective matrix that helps them stick to a surface and shield themselves from stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those plaque cores, immune cells called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-failure-creates-a-lasting-stress-memory-in-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt; did not appear to react to the biofilm. In other words, the bacteria appeared tucked away where the body’s defenses were not mounting a response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-bacteria-break-bad"&gt;When bacteria break bad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture changed at the edges of plaques that were cracked or appeared unstable. There, the researchers saw scattered bacteria that appeared to have broken free from the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/biofilms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hidden biofilm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift coincided with activation of immune alarms. Pattern recognition receptors lit up – especially through TLR2 – a classic “we found bacteria” signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alarm did not just activate the rapid innate immune response; it also drew in the slower, more targeted adaptive immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bacterial involvement in coronary artery disease has long been suspected, but direct and convincing evidence has been lacking,” explained &lt;a href="https://researchportal.tuni.fi/en/persons/pekka-karhunen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Pekka Karhunen&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrated the presence of genetic material – DNA – from several oral bacteria inside atherosclerotic plaques.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-disease-and-bacteria-signals"&gt;Heart disease and bacteria signals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples that tested positive for viridans streptococci tended to come from plaques that were more advanced and complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the autopsy series, bacterial signals lined up with deaths due to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That association does not prove the bacteria caused the deaths, but it strengthens the idea that they may play a role in a dangerous chain of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-daily-life-implications"&gt;Daily life implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brushing-your-teeth-regularly-can-prevent-deadly-liver-disease/"&gt;Oral health&lt;/a&gt; has long been linked with heart health in population studies. Everyday activities like brushing or chewing can push mouth bacteria into the bloodstream, especially when gums are inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings point to a path where certain mouth bacteria might colonize plaques, lie low in biofilms, and then shed pieces that trigger inflammation right where the plaque is fragile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a call for antibiotics to prevent heart attacks. It does not turn brushing into a magic shield against heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol levels, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, diabetes, and family history still carry a lot of weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests bacteria – especially in biofilm form – may be another player that nudges risky plaques toward rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-questions-need-answers"&gt;More questions need answers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, this surprising, peer-reviewed study links oral bacteria within arterial plaques to inflammation associated with plaque rupture, highlighting a plausible mouth-heart connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps include testing whether targeting biofilms, improving oral health, or dialing down specific immune alarms could make plaques more stable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will also need to sort out cause versus correlation and identify which bacterial features matter most inside human arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-you-should-do"&gt;What you should do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, continue to follow the basic guidelines urged by the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eggs-and-cholesterol-a-new-twist-in-an-old-debate/"&gt;LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; in check. Do not smoke or vape. Move your body most days. Sleep well. Eat in a way that supports cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep up with dental basics also – regular brushing, flossing, and routine checkups reduce the chances that mouth bacteria slip into your blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these habits are cure-alls on their own, but together they lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.125.041521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 02:26:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQU3VwRlNzakVNQTRudmhLXy0yMDlyN1lJSllkMHVZWEhPYTliYlhtdzVhQXRRR0J1cXVqaDZlWE1MX1Niai1xOFlPWDBQY0dXNVNTSUdmMTg0elZJaF8tT0lXM2RJa25WbE5tbzM2bkNid29QMnJmQzZqbk5MUE1DbUk5b0owZHhYdVhZX2Nvd19VMWRFSFluQ3dJdVNzbGhmQndPZmROTGVNVW5zQUIzdHRkVQ</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情爆发后两人死亡格兰特县赠款长期护理设施- Source ONE News</title><link>https://www.yoursourceone.com/columbia_basin/two-dead-after-covid-19-outbreak-hits-grant-long-term-care-facility-in-grant-county/article_9e7d0d35-2711-4699-aed7-b270879286c7.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MOSES LAKE — Health officials are warning of rising COVID-19 activity in Grant County following a significant outbreak at a local long-term care facility that has sickened more than 45 residents and staff. Two deaths have been confirmed, with one additional death under investigation, the Grant County Health District (GCHD) announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alexander Brzezny, Grant County Health Officer, said the outbreak underscores the continued threat of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our recent outbreak is a painful reminder that COVID-19 can still have a devastating impact, especially for older adults and people with underlying health conditions,” Brzezny said. “Our hearts are with the families and friends grieving the loss of their loved ones who passed away during this outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long-term care facility, working alongside GCHD, has implemented a series of preventive measures to slow the spread. These include isolation of infected residents, expanded testing and screening, use of protective equipment, and improved air circulation with commercial air purifiers provided by regional public health teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak comes as COVID-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations are climbing across the county, reflecting trends seen in wastewater surveillance. Similar increases are being reported across Washington state and much of the country, though health officials caution that the virus remains unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to urge vaccination, especially for vulnerable groups such as adults 65 and older, young children, and people with underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with Washington State Department of Health recommendations, GCHD advises everyone 6 months and older, including pregnant individuals, to receive the most current COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines can help reduce your chance of severe illness, hospitalization, and death,” GCHD said in a statement. Last year, data showed that vaccinated individuals had 30-40% greater protection against urgent care visits and 40-70% better protection against hospitalizations and ICU stays compared to those unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GCHD is encouraging residents to speak with their doctors about the best prevention steps, not only for COVID-19 but for other respiratory illnesses as fall approaches. Symptoms and outcomes of COVID-19 can vary widely, health officials noted, and the latest vaccines remain a key defense against severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This pattern should be repeated four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doing just one routine of the Norwegian 4x4 per week will reap big rewards for your heart health, Dr Levine says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prove how advantageous the Norwegian 4x4 can be, Dr Levine recruited 53 participants with an average age of 53, and he assigned them a fitness plan for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only vigorous part of the plan was the Norwegian 4x4, which the participants were told to perform once a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A simple workout routine performed once a week could help reverse your heart health by two decades, a leading cardiologist has revealed (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other elements of their program included one hour of doing a 'fun' physical activity per week, such as dancing or playing a sport, one 30-minute session of strength training,  and two to three days of moderate-intensity exercise for at least 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the two-year period, the middle-aged participants, who were previously sedentary, saw a dramatic improvement in their heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine used a heart catheterization (a diagnostic procedure a healthcare provider uses to see how well your heart is working) to measure the flexibility or 'youthfulness' of their hearts and found, after the study, their hearts were comparable to someone in their 30s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the heart ages, the main artery (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://utswmed.org/medblog/heart-cardio-workouts/"&gt;said the results&lt;/a&gt; of his study were 'quite compelling, and showed that it is possible to reverse some of the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle if you commit to a heart-healthy exercise routine in late middle age (40 to 64 years).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He carried out a follow-up study involving patients in the same age range who had 'thickened' aortas that made them high risk for heart disease or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that they were given the same exercise treatment plan for one year, and they showed a similar improvement in the elasticity, or 'youthfulness,' of their heart muscle as the research team saw in healthy middle-aged individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The heart expert concluded: 'This study shows that dedicated exercise training in middle age can reverse some of the consequences of diseases such as hypertension, and can potentially stave off more serious diseases such as heart failure in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heart disease continues to kill more people in the US than any other cause, according to the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022 (the most recent year for which final data is available), there were nearly 1million deaths from coronary artery disease, heart attack, and stroke - collectively referred to as cardiovascular disease - the equivalent of a death every 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer, meanwhile, kills roughly 600,000 Americans per year, while dementia is responsible for 288,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from the American Heart Association say a lack of awareness compared to other diseases like cancer and an increase in risk factors may be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attack cases are on the rise in young Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Levine suggests that 'exercise should be a prescription for life'. He says: 'The benefits of a healthy heart for longevity and quality of life are too great to ignore' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, heart disease can be a silent killer, lurking for decades before symptoms start to appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts also warn that while deaths from heart disease may be starting to plateau for the first time since the pandemic, risk factors for the disease are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly half of US adults have high blood pressure, for example, and almost three-quarters are overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts reveal that if trends continue, two-thirds of US adults will become obese and suffer high blood pressure by 2050, further increasing their risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise can reduce the risk of heart and circulatory diseases by up to 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults should get 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine suggests that 'exercise should be a prescription for life'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'The benefits of a healthy heart for longevity and quality of life are too great to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A regular exercise routine will help you keep your heart healthy for years to come. Jog, swim, golf, hike, play basketball, dance, do yoga - whatever you love to do. The most important thing is to get out there and do it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — &lt;span&gt;Two people have died after eating Louisiana oysters infected with the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/how-to-protect-yourself-from-vibrio-vulnificus-the-bacteria-found-in-some-coastal-waters" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wbrz.com/news/how-to-protect-yourself-from-vibrio-vulnificus-the-bacteria-found-in-some-coastal-waters&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1756427330539000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw3OwuXwXyGrlhFrf80ckg-Z" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;flesh-eating bacteria&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Vibrio vulnificus, officials confirmed to WBRZ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A state health official said that the two deaths happened after people ate oysters harvested in Louisiana at two separate restaurants — one in Louisiana and another in Florida. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jennifer Armentor, molluscan shellfish program administrator from the Louisiana Department of Health, added that 14 more people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;been infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, 34 people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;been infected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and six people have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wbrz.com/news/wednesday-s-health-report-20-louisianians-infected-with-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-2025-up-from-past/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wbrz.com/news/wednesday-s-health-report-20-louisianians-infected-with-flesh-eating-bacteria-in-2025-up-from-past/&amp;amp;source=gmail&amp;amp;ust=1756427330539000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2i5x39Du_6Od_uOxM2hMJ9" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;died in 2025 alone,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a higher rate than any previous year over the last decade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s just prolific right now,” Armentor told the Louisiana Oyster Task Force on Tuesday at the New Orleans Lakefront Airport.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;WBRZ spoke with Jones Creek Cafe &amp;amp; Oyster Bar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;CEO George Shaheen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; about this news and how seafood spots ensure that their oysters &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;stay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; tasty and safe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen has been at the head of his business for nearly 40 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Well, over the years, we haven't had as much of that as you would actually think because the way that the Wildlife and Fisheries and the Department of Health have created a bond between the fishermen who are out there fishing and how things need to be done and handled," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen told WBRZ that he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; his oysters from Delacroix Island, where he used to fish, and has complete trust in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;those&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; who harvest the oysters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"You have to go out, and when you go on a boat and you're an oyster fisherman out there, you can stay out there, I think it's 72 hours if you have a way to cool the oysters when they come in," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shaheen showed WBRZ some tickets that are put onto oyster sacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tickets &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; information such as where the oysters were harvested and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; they were harvested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It basically is really the key to being able to, if something happens somewhere, they know right where to go. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;By&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Department of Health, we &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; to keep these for 90 days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; We get checked every 120 days," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He says that modern growing and harvesting techniques make for better oysters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Now, they use limestone out in the marsh to basically grow the oysters on, and they're much cleaner. The difference between you getting them out of the marsh mud and being on a Limestone is that they're much cleaner," Shaheen said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Restaurants in Louisiana are required by law to display visible signs or messages about the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;risk of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; eating raw seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Yes, cause you never know what's in the ocean and what gets inside these oysters, so if they're not cooked, you can easily get bacteria, so you have to put a warning out for people," Jones Creek bartender Amanda Steele said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Customers WBRZ spoke with at Jones Creek share the same trust that the restaurant does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I eat them (oysters) both ways (cooked and raw) and eat them in the raw state in the wintertime. I trust my local oyster bars," Customer Larry Campagna said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

These include "fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes," officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While many people believe plague to be a disease of the distant past, it has been endemic in the Western U.S. since a plague outbreak took place in San Francisco around the turn of the 20th century.

Prior to the current incident, the last case of human plague in El Dorado County took place in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.eldoradocounty.ca.gov/County-Government/Countywide-Press-Releases/Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to county officials;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to county officials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, with the plague being spread to humans by infected fleas, the situation served as a reminder of the risks that insect-borne diseases still pose to human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In many parts of the world, mosquitoes carrying deadly diseases like malaria and dengue fever have been spreading beyond their traditional geographic ranges due in large part to rising global temperatures. These expanding ranges place more people at risk of contracting these life-threatening illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about the plague?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To reduce the risk of contracting the plague, El Dorado County officials &lt;a href="https://www.eldoradocounty.ca.gov/County-Government/Countywide-Press-Releases/Resident-Tests-Positive-for-Plague" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; taking several measures, some of which would also be effective in protecting oneself against other diseases spread by insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These recommendations included wearing long pants tucked into boot tops when hiking through natural areas and avoiding wild rodents such as squirrels and chipmunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Since infected fleas can catch a ride on family pets, officials also recommended keeping dogs on a leash while in nature areas and not letting pets near wild rodents, especially dead ones, or their burrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?recjRV0EN8bHSuzXF" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 00:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQTUZrcXpPcExrN080c0VwSUNJTUs4QmkzVUt5eUhCMkdlb3o4Q3BsOGluS20td3Rxaks5OGR0MF9KZlZFRkI2NzJsNkdJbGxoU2dtYUltZGttUU9OMzZNOFRGQ3k0djZQQnl0MVFUM1piNUdvZ3dqeGhiUUN6YmJfSFBQU0dCazBzWVpwcnFkUHM2RFU</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚将这4个因素与更高的卒中风险联系起来- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/stroke-risk-index-study-11798088</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher TyG-WWI index scores are linked to an increased risk of stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The index combines triglycerides, blood sugar, body weight and waist size.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study findings suggest potential for early stroke risk detection and prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and though there were years of progress in reducing its impact, in recent years, strokes have become more and more common.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Insulin resistance, a condition where the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, plays a key role in stroke recurrence and poor recovery, often linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With rising global obesity rates, conditions like insulin resistance and related stroke risks are becoming more common.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Measures like the triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, which indicates insulin resistance, and the weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), which evaluates fat distribution, have been shown to predict stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A new combined measure, the TyG-WWI index, has recently been linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-reduce-your-risk-of-stroke-11698358" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;higher risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt; in people with prediabetes, but its role in the general population is still unclear. Understanding how these markers work together could help improve &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-9am-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-11745518" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;stroke prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To bridge this knowledge gap, researchers explored whether the TyG-WWI index health measure is linked to stroke risk in the general population. The goal was to find better ways to assess stroke risk, improve healthcare management and develop timely strategies to help people who are at high risk of having a stroke, and these results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) is a large U.S. health study that collects data to monitor the nation’s health and nutrition. It uses a special sampling method to ensure the results represent the entire population. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this study, researchers analyzed NHANES data from 1999 to 2018, focusing on adults, resulting in 22,615 adults in the analysis. The main focus was on the health measure the TyG-WWI index, which combines triglyceride levels, blood sugar, body weight and waist size to assess health risks. Blood samples and body measurements were taken by trained professionals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Factors like age, sex, ethnicity, education, income and health conditions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease) were also considered to better understand stroke risk. The data was then analyzed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study looked at how TyG-WWI values—which reflect both the triglyceride glucose index and the weight-adjusted waist index—are linked to stroke risk. Researchers found that as TyG-WWI values increased, so did the risk of stroke. Initially, without considering any other factors, a rise in TyG-WWI values was linked to a 65% higher stroke risk. After accounting for age and sex, the increased risk dropped to 24%, and when all other factors were considered, it was 15%. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make it easier to compare, participants were divided into four groups based on their TyG-WWI values. Compared to the group with the lowest scores, the other groups had higher stroke risks: 37% higher in the group with the second lowest values, and 38% higher in the group with the very highest values. This finding indicates that higher TyG-WWI values were consistently linked to a greater risk of stroke.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also found a clear, linear relationship: as TyG-WWI values increased, so did stroke risk. This pattern was especially strong in younger participants and those without coronary heart disease. Other factors like sex, ethnicity, education and smoking or drinking habits didn’t significantly change this relationship.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has a few limitations to consider before applying the findings to the general population. First, because it was based on data collected at a single point in time, it is not possible to determine whether higher TyG-WWI values directly cause an increased risk of stroke. To establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, future studies that follow participants over time are needed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Second, while we accounted for many factors that could influence the results, it’s possible that unknown factors still played a role, which the researchers couldn’t fully control for. Lastly, since this research focused on data from the U.S. population, it’s uncertain whether the findings apply to people in other countries. More studies are needed to confirm whether these results are consistent across different populations and settings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The connection between the TyG-WWI index and stroke risk has real-world implications that could change how we approach stroke prevention. Think of the TyG-WWI index as a health "check engine" light; it combines key factors like blood sugar, triglycerides, body weight and waist size to give a snapshot of your metabolic health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For health care providers, this could become a powerful tool to spot people at higher risk of stroke early, even before any warning signs appear. For the rest of us, it’s a wake-up call to pay attention to things like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight management, blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and fat distribution. With obesity and metabolic concerns on the rise, this kind of early detection could make a significant difference in preventing strokes and improving recovery outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re concerned about your own blood sugar or cholesterol levels, checking in with a healthcare professional can be a good first step. You can also try to shake up your routine to incorporate more exercise and more healthy meals. We love using short, adaptable meal plans—like our weeklong &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-insulin-resistance-11759777" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;No-Sugar High-Fiber Meal Plan for Insulin Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and our seven-day &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-fiber-no-sugar-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11775446" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;High-Fiber, No-Sugar Meal Plan for Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;—as a simple and delicious way to reset your routine and discover new recipes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the important role the TyG-WWI index could play in understanding and managing stroke risk. By combining key health markers like blood sugar, triglycerides, body weight and waist size, this index offers a practical way to assess metabolic health and identify individuals who may be at higher risk of stroke. While more research is needed to confirm these findings across different populations and to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship, the results are a step forward in improving how we approach stroke prevention.

The vaccines from Moderna are approved for children as young as 6 months, Pfizer for ages 5 years and up, and Novavax for those 12 years and older — but only for patients considered to be at higher risk. Parents are being told to consult with their doctors to determine eligibility, adding another layer of complexity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults over 65 will be able to get the vaccines without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; is expected to meet in the coming weeks to decide whether to recommend the updated COVID-19 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach reflects a policy shift &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46&amp;amp;t=4wz-6cMxurEYtiMNsYMFcw" data-link="native" class=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in a May video, when Kennedy said the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children or pregnant people. The &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" data-link="native" class=""&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; broke from that guidance, recommending individuals get a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. The &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2025/the-american-academy-of-pediatrics-releases-its-own-evidence-based-immunization-schedule/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; also continues to recommend that infants over 6 months and children be vaccinated against COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball warned that children under 2 years old could be at risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms if they are not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kids from 6 months old to 2 years old have the highest rate of hospitalization of any Americans, equivalent to that of people who are 65 and older,” he said. “They are not included in this guidance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also flagged a potential “two-tiered system” of access, which may deepen inequities in care. He pointed to the federally funded Vaccines for Children &lt;a href="https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccinesforchildren/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; that provides routine vaccinations for children on Medicaid. The program generally follows CDC guidance on what is considered a routine vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In California, over 50% of kids are on Medicaid, and they get their vaccines this way, and they might not be able to get them this year,” Ball said. “We already have a socioeconomic disparity … and now we’re going to put even more barriers on a lot of people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-3" data-large-id="Inline-5" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the hurdles, both doctors urged parents to turn to trusted health providers for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any family who wants to vaccinate their kid after conversations with their doctor should have the opportunity,” Ball said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong added that while the rollout has been chaotic, there is still some reassurance: “We will have a new vaccine this year, and the people who need it the most are going to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-4" data-large-id="Inline-6" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 23:59:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQRko1czMyb2U4UHRrakctbHZoeWwtaF9PN0tEd2NvNmFGUFhKRkJKSGEwZFN2VTItTl95TFVTY1cyNUs4dHRUWmhBT1hGR0RWcFJWMFRpYVNBbzVja1dCdmRWZmh3SUZVRGU1S0Y1ZUUzSVp4eUYtZjRfN2s3UUVxZ2tUazFla2EzYk1LVEdPZWxFSWVFcmtuN1M5ME00UQ</guid></item><item><title>您每天需要走多少路才能降低患心脏病的风险- BuzzFeed</title><link>https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillianwilson/preventing-heart-disease-walking-sc</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;Between work, errands, family obligations and household chores, life is busy. Taking time for yourself may not be feasible right now and that’s OK. If you can’t fit in the recommended 21 minutes of walking a day, start small. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even a quick one-minute jaunt pays off,” according to the report by Harvard Health. The report noted that a 2014 study from the University of Utah found that “for every minute of brisk walking that women did throughout the day, they lowered their risk of obesity by 5%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So start small. Task yourself with a minute-long walk down your driveway this afternoon, or take that 10-minute work check-in call as you walk around your block. No amount of time is too short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you feel ready, you can start to incorporate different walking distances and intensities, like speed changes and hills, Singh said. Both of these things, plus “maintaining a consistent habit will likely yield the biggest bang for its buck,” she explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/preventing-heart-disease-walking_l_62def5bae4b03dbb991be966" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7930552"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(WLOS) — &lt;/span&gt;Hydrate Medical is expanding its services to offer ketamine therapy one day a week, according to a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine therapy will be administered by Keith Parris, an Acute Care Nurse Practitioner, every Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hurricane anniversaries often bring a resurgence of emotional distress, anxiety, and trauma-related symptoms. In areas like Asheville and the surrounding mountain communities, where natural disasters have left a lasting impact, access to innovative mental health care is more crucial than ever," said Hydrate Medical in the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/health-alert/i-v-hydration-clinic-opens-in-asheville" target="_blank" title="https://wlos.com/news/health-alert/i-v-hydration-clinic-opens-in-asheville" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;IV HYDRATION CLINIC OPENS IN ASHEVILLE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the news release, ketamine therapy is a form of therapy that treats drug-resistant depression, PTSD, OCD, and anxiety. The release says ketamine is a "non-narcotic medication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the release, ketamine works by targeting glutamate receptors in the brain, leading to "rapid relief of depressive symptoms and promoting long-term healing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our goal is to offer more than hydration services—we want to be a wellness partner for the whole person,"  said Keith Parris, mental health provider and co-founder of Hydrate Medical and Derive Health. "Bringing ketamine therapy to Asheville gives us another tool to help people who feel like they've tried everything else."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the release, nearly 80% of treatment-resistant depression patients have reported significant improvement when using ketamine in a supportive therapeutic setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 23:09:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggJBVV95cUxNbHJacFZxeHhYV1JrVFlKaVBySkZDMExLM3ZIM0pEaEZlcktna3c0eGRBNjgyekcwa3pWRFZMUUY3VDZMYTU1X012Y0ZJOWEwOTZRRVFsbXdraGFQME45eE1id2ZBUnJXcjJ3NWJJY3lFUVFyMzZ4T0s5RFMwcUVBVkgxR0l3LVJFNE1FeG83MUptZ215T0FIUHd0UDF2cEVUYjh3OGl5bDRCdjhOa2tEVW5McW1kYUtQZlpzdjhuTldJcEQwNHMzNnpwc1dXTDMwUjVfLVBieFgtTTkwV2Q4VW83aG5haU1DTHhmdW00UW5zQmsxcXZMS1pldXZ3YmtqbFE</guid></item></channel></rss>
