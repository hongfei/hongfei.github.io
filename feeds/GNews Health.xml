But although it is still true that the &lt;a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06887/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;majority of new cancer diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; affect the over-70s, the pattern is changing in subtle ways. Some cancers are increasingly found in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Take colorectal (bowel) cancer: while rates have declined in those over 60, data shows a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7994182/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sharp increase in many developed countries&lt;/a&gt; among people under 50, in what’s called early-onset disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This isn’t just due to wider screening or better diagnosis, and it isn’t only found in one particular country or community. The increase is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00600-4/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;real and global&lt;/a&gt;, rising from approximately 94,700 cases &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323588/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in 1990 to 225,736 in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. A study across Europe found that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6839794/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;for those aged 20-29&lt;/a&gt;, incidence rose 7.9% per year between 2004 and 2016, with the rates increasing by 4.9% in those aged 30–39, and 1.6% in the 40-49 group in roughly the same period. Not only is colon cancer increasing in every age cohort under 50, the growth rate is highest in the youngest group. &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/news-events/increase-of-early-onset-colorectal-cancer-a-cohort-effect/#:~:text=The%20research%20team%20estimates%20that,%2Da%2Dcohort%2Deffect/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Modelling suggests&lt;/a&gt; that early-onset colorectal cancer could double every 15 years in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In England, the NHS bowel cancer screening programme covers people aged 50-74 by &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/bowel-cancer-screening-programme-overview#:~:text=population%20screening%20programmes.-,Target%20population,on%200800%20707%2060%2060." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inviting them for a free screening&lt;/a&gt; every two years. However, this age range excludes younger people, who are usually only diagnosed at a late stage when the cancer has spread and they are symptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What’s causing the rise in young people? We can rule out genetics: &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq#:~:text=About%2075%25%20of%20patients%20with,overall.%5B3%2C4%5D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;it’s estimated&lt;/a&gt; that 75% of cases are in people with no previous family history or known genetic predisposition. Scientists have started to look at environmental factors tied to the increase in colon cancer since the 1960s, with each generation &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/25/cancer-striking-earlier-ultra-processed-foods" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more likely to get cancer&lt;/a&gt; than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One factor keeps emerging as a major culprit: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/28/ultra-processed-food-increases-risk-of-early-death-international-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-025-01159-z" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2025 review&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Reviews Endocrinology&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;highlighting the links. These foods, roughly defined as factory-packaged snacks, ready meals, sugary cereals, soft drinks, processed meats and many fast foods, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/28/ultra-processed-food-32-harmful-effects-health-review" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;now make up more than half the average diet&lt;/a&gt; in countries such as the UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The evidence is growing: a major study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2021-068921#:~:text=What%20this%20study%20adds%20*%20High%20consumption,for%20better%20health%20outcomes%20in%20the%20population." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt; looked at three large US cohorts to examine the association of ultra-processed foods with the risk of colorectal cancer. One of these cohorts involved more than 46,000 men, tracked over 24 to 28 years. Compared with the group that consumed ultra-processed food the least, the risk of those who consumed the most of developing colorectal cancer – even accounting for nutrition and weight – was 29% higher. The authors conclude that further studies are needed to understand the physiological mechanisms of how exactly ultra-processed foods contribute to cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What’s interesting is while much of the research has linked ultra-processed foods to the rise in obesity, which is then a major risk factor for numerous cancers, the study above points to the growth in colorectal cancer in those &lt;em&gt;of normal weight&lt;/em&gt;. Could it be that ultra-processed foods may be carcinogenic regardless of someone’s body mass index (BMI)? In other words, are those foods bad for your health even if you have an active lifestyle and are in a healthy weight range?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Diets high in ultra-processed foods &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11901572/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have been linked&lt;/a&gt; to disruptions in insulin signalling, chronic low-grade inflammation and alterations in the gut microbiome, all of which are mechanisms implicated in cancer development. What we eat affects how our cells grow, how our immune systems function and how our gut bacteria – which help regulate inflammation and immunity – behave. &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/77/1/27/616090/Dietary-Emulsifier-Induced-Low-Grade-Inflammation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Emulsifiers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378111920302596" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/ehp.10271" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; commonly found in ultra-processed foods have been shown in animal studies to promote intestinal inflammation and tumour growth. Meanwhile, the lack of fibre and protective phytochemicals (health-promoting compounds found in plants) in these foods &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9455721/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can alter the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; needed for the body to function optimally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-9" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Matters of Opinion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"matters-of-opinion","successDescription":"Guardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and more"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The next decade may see the inclusion of ultra-processed foods as a key risk factor for colorectal cancer, particularly in young adults. I’m not writing this to scare you. It’s rather to reflect on recent research from rigorous and long-term studies. What we eat matters more than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If smoking was the cancer villain of the 20th century, eating ultra-processed food may be its 21st-century counterpart. The science isn’t yet settled, but it’s building rapidly. It’s been often said that food is medicine. And as we’re increasingly learning, food is prevention. On that note, a &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/regular-yogurt-consumption-may-reduce-colon-cancer-risk/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that regularly eating yoghurt may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, a subset of colorectal cancer. So if there’s one takeaway from reading this: eat more yoghurt, and fewer ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 12:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOQ2pkWnZYRmxtTEs1WWt4c2pNbDg0VDFyRmhEYmNDLXI1STlsT2tsZlFvaUczSm9TcEVVQlhFX3JHZ2l4VElVZnNYZXExQjlVQXdodUxRaldwb3pwRVNTOHpUZ2NDanFuR0pPZmszYm5obTBhdjBVRHQtVDdfVmlteERxUEhRdmh4TzFsdFlnWjE4QUZTOVg0SU42Q09ZdzJrMEcwemZkYWJCVFg3amc</guid></item><item><title>他们迫切需要一个婴儿。他们转向尖端机器人。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/01/ivf-babies-ai-robots-fertility/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N75ZJC737RHRBEPO4EBS3PK43A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;MEXICO CITY — When she walked into an IVF clinic in June, Alin Quintana knew it would be the last time she would try to conceive a child. She had prepared herself spiritually and mentally&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for the visit: She had traveled to a nearby state to leave prayer ribbons at a shrine dedicated to Mary Undoer of Knots, a manifestation beloved in Latin America. She had received a blessing from her priest. That morning, as Quintana and her husband wound their way for hours from the unpaved outskirts of the Mexican capital toward the swanky clinic in one of its richest neighborhoods, her mind was alert, as if she were making a recording. She was focusing on the moment, she said, to drown out the weight of painful memories — a lost pregnancy, a burst fallopian tube, emergency surgery, 96 monthly cycles of hope and crushing disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 12:02:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOZ0w1Tk5kU2RlX0lrMEYzZHE2R2hFZEx1cElqRVp3U2NXN214SUMxbGs2dlNFN1oxd2JpTXRVbHlucWxuVlRJNHJqclhxMHVZTlkxX1ZjR0JhbE1WMWIwV2d5c2w4MXBNa1FwdWVPRFdVb0NQRjZJdjBzNEwyOVRJQnBDU2VZU1h2VzlIMA</guid></item><item><title>对人类来说，变老并不是什么新鲜事。那么，为什么我们现在如此糟糕呢？ - Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/growing-old-is-nothing-new-for-humans-so-why-are-we-so-bad-at-it-now-2000664208</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aging is inevitable, but it hasn’t always looked the same throughout the long history of humankind. That’s one of the core premises behind Michael Gurven’s just-released new book, &lt;em&gt;Seven Decades: How We Evolved to Live Longer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gurven is an anthropologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has spent much of his career studying and living alongside communities like the Tsimané of South America, indigenous groups who largely subsist off a combination of farming small crops, hunting, and gathering. Though these people have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/an-indigenous-group-famous-for-its-heart-health-started-1838184949"&gt;increasingly started to come&lt;/a&gt; into contact with the modern world, they still provide a glimpse into humanity’s past prior to widespread industrialization.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Building off his and others’ work with today’s subsistence communities, Gurven makes the compelling case that while the typical lifespan of the average person today has greatly expanded and our health has generally improved, there’s nothing particularly new about human longevity itself. Older people have always existed, even in past eras when survival was much more perilous than it is today. Moreover, he adds, there’s plenty we can learn about how best to grow older in our modern times by studying how our ancestors did it so many eons ago.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Gizmodo spoke to Gurven about his decision to not address longevity drugs, the most common misconceptions about aging, and how groups like the Tsimané might better help us better appreciate our elders. The following conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Cara, Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; I think many people who pick up a book about aging would expect to read about the breakthroughs around the corner that will supposedly and significantly prolong our lives. What made you want to focus more on the evolution of human aging?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Gurven: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks for asking that, because I always worry that the first question I’m gonna get is exactly that: “What are the secrets? What are the hidden gems?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything’s about the potential of where we can end up—the power of regenerative medicine and technology. But &lt;span id="161.82" class="wordsOnlyNodes" tabindex="430"&gt;I wanted to actually kind of look back in order to look forward. &lt;/span&gt;One of the premises of the book is that longevity is not something that is so incredibly recent, but that it’s built into our DNA. It’s built into our biology. We’ve already accomplished the potential for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And because of that, I see a different type of optimism. There’s this scare over the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4933329/"&gt;silver tsunami&lt;/a&gt; and everything that goes along with the global population aging. I wanted to point out that this is not a new type of problem. It’s not that there were never old people and now all of a sudden there are tons of old people. So I wanted to give a history of understanding that we have already lived with older people as part of our population.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;And I wanted to argue that rather than longevity being a consequence of our success as a species, the causal arrows may actually be in the opposite direction. That we’ve been a very successful species because of our potential for longevity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve solved problems before, and we can solve this one moving forward, but it’s not going to be a problem that’s going to be solved just with new technology and improvements in molecular medicine. There are lessons to be learned here by appreciating our natural history.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gizmodo: &lt;/b&gt;Your book covers many different aspects and attitudes about how people today age now compared to the past. What would you say are some of the biggest misconceptions about human longevity and aging?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gurven: &lt;/strong&gt;The biggest one is just a misunderstanding of what life expectancy is in general.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When people say that life expectancy was much shorter in the past and maybe even as low as the 30s, that doesn’t mean everyone lived to age 30 and then died. Even with shorter life expectancies, you can have people who are much longer-lived than that, because it’s an average. And because we used to have lots of deaths early in life, that basically lowers that average.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Conversely, are there ways that people can romanticize the past and how we lived and died back prior to industrialization?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gurven: &lt;/strong&gt;Everyone looks to hunter-gatherers, and they see what they want to see. Either they see the hellish landscape of “all against all” and how life was really awful, or some people see a very romantic scenario, where everyone was vegetarian and hugging trees and in tune with nature, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So actually paying attention to how hunter-gatherers live is an important kind of lesson that I’m trying to convey, with firsthand experience having worked and lived with these kinds of groups. Which of those myths are somewhat off base, and which ones might actually be true?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; Getting to that, what are some of the things that we’ve learned from studying longevity and elder members in communities like the Tsimané?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gurven: &lt;/strong&gt;One thing, which maybe goes along with the thinking that no one really lived that long, is just the idea that so many diseases of aging we take for granted are just going to befall us no matter what, because it’s hard to think of aging without thinking about heart disease and dementia and those kinds of things. But the very fact is that in these fairly high mortality populations [like the Tsimané], you don’t see those kinds of diseases, and it’s not because no one is living to those ages when those diseases typically manifest. Even when we follow people from age 40 onwards, we can see that people are not developing heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So that’s like a really important kind of lesson because that tells us there’s so much to learn about these diseases, which are our major sources of mortality in the industrialized world.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We already know that if you don’t smoke, are physically active, maintain a reasonable weight, and eat well, you can live a healthier life. But when you can see that at a whole population level, where almost an entire population can live without heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s, that’s pretty amazing. And so it does demonstrate that these big risk factors—the smoking, physical inactivity, excess weight, etcetera—account for the vast majority of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, which is over half the deaths, basically, that we experience today; it demonstrates that those deaths are actually preventable with things that whole populations are already doing.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;I also think there are just broader lessons about what older people are doing and their expectations. There’s no formal retirement at age 65 or at any age in hunter-gatherers. There’s no expectation that you now have a life of leisure; you know, pick your cruise. And so, I certainly like the idea that, with this kind of growth mindset, learning is a lifelong process, right? And aging is not just the reverse of growth. It’s not just decline; there’s continued growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean that everyone just keeps doing the exact same thing until they die. In fact, there are great shifts in what men and women tend to do in these societies. But the important point, kind of zooming out, is that they stay relevant, they stay engaged, and they stay involved.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gizmodo:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you hope people most take away from this book—those reaching their elder years as well as those who have grandparents or other older people in their lives?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gurven: &lt;/strong&gt;I hope to inspire, kind of a new type of optimism. Not an optimism that’s just based on maximizing our lives, our longevity, or even our health span. I mean, those things are critical, and I’m glad that there are other books and other people working on that. But what I’m trying to get is people thinking at a deeper level about where we’re at now and where we’re headed in the next couple decades.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no medical solutions that are going to make 85-year-olds biologically like 35-year-olds, right? And so realistically, in the next couple decades, I’m hoping that people get newly inspired about how to rethink elderhood and respectfully think about our older adults as elders, realizing that we have something to learn from them, that there’s a place for them, and that it’s not just a service to those elders, but that we all benefit from having them in our lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the looking back in this book is to show all the different ways that we’ve already done this throughout our evolutionary history.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Every few years, the concept of fasted exercise training pops up all over social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasted training refers to exercising in the morning, before eating breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/im-an-expert-on-weight-loss-here-are-5-truths-you-need-to-know"&gt;I'm an Expert on Weight Loss. Here Are 5 Truths You Need to Know.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans will claim it's the most efficient way to lose body fat. Opponents say it's a terrible idea and will cause you to gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who's right and what does the research evidence say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where did the idea come from?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasted exercise, proponents say, will cause better changes in body composition – the proportion of lean mass (muscle), bone and fat. In particular, they say fasted exercise leads to fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/690553/original/file-20250912-56-durln5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;rect=0%2C203%2C3718%2C2091&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Proponents say fasted exercise will cause better changes in body composition. &lt;a class="source" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-wearing-black-tank-top-and-running-on-seashore-1390403/"&gt;(Leandro Boogalu/Pexels&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive changes in body composition can occur through losses of fat mass, while either maintaining or gaining lean mass. Or even through gaining lean mass in the absence of any loss of body fat. All of which may be considered positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea fasted exercises leads to such positive body composition changes stems from research that shows exercising after eating versus exercise before eating affects metabolism &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sms.13054?casa_token=5fVjaCSGH04AAAAA%3ANF0fKViNcwCNA-6gHVCTde70d0nt0ZYNYasOjpocukGgD_lEDDBnEbOALbmS-4O333L2lN7NITn70NKY"&gt;differently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerobic exercise in a fasted state causes you to burn more fat as a fuel (what researchers would call "&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/effects-of-aerobic-exercise-performed-in-fasted-v-fed-state-on-fat-and-carbohydrate-bolism-in-adults-a-systematic-review-and-analysis/0EA2328A0FF91703C95FD39A38716811"&gt;fat oxidation&lt;/a&gt;") when measured at a single point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it wasn't a big leap to assume this would translate to longer-term fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/2/4/43#B44-jfmk-02-00043"&gt;systematic review&lt;/a&gt; from my team demonstrated that a fasted exercise training program doesn't seem to translate into long-term differences in body fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discrepancy between fat burned as a fuel during exercise, and changes in body fat in the long term has often been misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This apparent contradiction may come down to the fact the body seems to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19305201/"&gt;find ways to compensate&lt;/a&gt;. Fat burning seems to reduce once you eat, and people who have exercised hard may end up expending less total energy over the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exercise science, it's actually pretty common to find that short-term effects don't always translate to longer-term impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, intense short-term exercise can negatively affect your immune system in the moment, but doing regular exercise can actually affect it &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22130467/"&gt;positively&lt;/a&gt; in the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/688820/original/file-20250903-56-ke5v9n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;rect=0%2C184%2C3696%2C2079&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A woman prepares for a deadlift" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/688820/original/file-20250903-56-ke5v9n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;rect=0%2C184%2C3696%2C2079&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/688820/original/file-20250903-56-ke5v9n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=397&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/688820/original/file-20250903-56-ke5v9n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=397&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/688820/original/file-20250903-56-ke5v9n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=397&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/688820/original/file-20250903-56-ke5v9n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=499&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/688820/original/file-20250903-56-ke5v9n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=499&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/688820/original/file-20250903-56-ke5v9n.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=499&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Exercising after eating improves performance in activities lasting over 60 minutes.

A &lt;a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/30/5/article-p345.xml?ref=trizone"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; completed by almost 2,000 endurance athletes showed non-professional athletes are more likely to exercise fasted compared to professional athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about strength training?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So do you get differences in muscle strength, size, and body composition changes in response to doing resistance training (such as weightlifting) when you've fasted versus when you've eaten? Unfortunately, the research is limited and low quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This limited evidence so far suggests it makes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360859225003043?casa_token=HTONvL8Fi9sAAAAA:zo-iRGoKKjFyFoS6VhCXqq6spa5bJHFXrXvmjUxZ9GwWaDl11nfar3sbfSiHZ_pdQNF5ceAFRA"&gt;no difference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One recent &lt;a href="https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijsnem/35/4/article-p291.xml?content=pdf"&gt;randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; also found no difference in strength, power, or lean body mass when resistance training was done twice a week for 12 weeks either after fasting or after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the potential drawbacks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasted training can make you feel really hungry after exercise, which can lead you to make &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-021-00993-1"&gt;poorer food choices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may even get headaches and nausea when trying to exercise fasted. This isn't universal experience, though; social media is full of people who say exercising while fasting makes them feel great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, there is no clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence doesn't support the superiority of fasted exercise for weight loss, or sports performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the evidence also doesn't show it causes a problem in many scenarios (except perhaps elite sports performance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you're short on time and skipping breakfast is going to allow you to get out and get that run or workout in, then go for it. Don't worry too much about the consequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the idea of exercising on an empty tummy makes you want to avoid the gym, then grab some breakfast before you go. Rest assured it won't be working against your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise fads and wellness hacks come and go but the thing backed by solid and consistent evidence is exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply doing it matters the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not the time of day, not the exact exercise choice, not even the exact amount – and definitely, not if you have or haven't eaten before you exercise.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264368/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A resident in Telford, United Kingdom, experienced firsthand the impact of enforcement, receiving a £1,000 ($1,345) fine in addition to other penalties — a significant win for the environment and the community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/telford-man-fined-1000-for-failing-to-clear-illegal-waste-site" target="_blank"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;, the Environment Agency reaffirmed its commitment to protecting local communities by making sure polluters are held accountable. Its case against Brian Anthony Woods, which began in 2019, finally ended in a conviction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Woods was charged with running a waste operation site without the necessary environmental permit. In 2020, the court had ordered him to remove the waste and not bring in any more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the Environment Agency's press release, an aerial photograph shows a site cluttered with waste materials. Despite repeated checks between 2020 and 2024, much of this waste remained. Woods claimed that he lacked the funds to fully clear the site of waste after his &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-business/" data-internallinksmanager029f6b8e52c="72" title="Green business" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;business&lt;/a&gt; collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-81cdf684ac1717d5b31965d2087252e0 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-81cdf684ac1717d5b31965d2087252e0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-ac72b18895feae1ccc1269168fd6a17f theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-ac72b18895feae1ccc1269168fd6a17f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-90254814e8c2640e74b6d0b0718cfaf0 theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-90254814e8c2640e74b6d0b0718cfaf0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-a56308c06e4e6ff96ffdd833d22b7610 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-a56308c06e4e6ff96ffdd833d22b7610"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-fa568be5acb9b50c5ce4524221065fcf theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-fa568be5acb9b50c5ce4524221065fcf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-84d9ea9c3f7c5fc4035bb3d7540044c4 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-84d9ea9c3f7c5fc4035bb3d7540044c4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-d574d70d208ec73266908046888da4d9 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-d574d70d208ec73266908046888da4d9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August, the Telford Magistrates Court imposed a £1,000 fine on Woods for failing to comply with the earlier order. The fine comes after other penalties, including 100 hours of unpaid community work, £1,470 ($1,977) in costs, and £114 ($153) victim's surcharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-1facfe61eb922d06ccd81a2cd08460e1 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-1facfe61eb922d06ccd81a2cd08460e1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This case isn't an isolated issue. According to the Environment Agency's &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6878a034a52cca025ef5bd6e/National_waste_crime_survey_2025_-_results_and_findings.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt;, the waste industry estimates that roughly 20% of all waste in England is illegally managed. That's approximately 38 million tons of potentially hazardous waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-1585097189" data-theco-trackid="561749" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

In &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/illegal-dumping-waste-storage-site-owner/" target="_blank"&gt;Whitehaven&lt;/a&gt;, a man was penalized for illegal waste operations. A lessee of a farm in &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/illegal-waste-site-lissa-appleby-farm-renter/" target="_blank"&gt;Staffordshire&lt;/a&gt; was also fined for using the space as an illegal waste site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Improper waste disposal risks contaminating soil, water, and air quality, ultimately leading to adverse health outcomes, as &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/who-compendium-on-health-and-environment/who_compendium_chapter4.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt; by the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-f6c0eaa55457ddcc7092272bc98846d6 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-f6c0eaa55457ddcc7092272bc98846d6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It's because of these dangers that the Environment Agency remains steadfast in pursuing individuals and companies who don't comply with regulations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Failure to comply with these legal requirements is a serious offense that can damage the environment and harm human health," warned an agency spokesperson, per the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-10th-p-carousel theco-target" id="theco-1966193687" data-theco-trackid="446882" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesady issued standing orders allowing pharmacists to test and treat influenza.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the order, pharmacists will be able to evaluate people 5 years old and older who are showing signs or symptoms of influenza; conduct point-of-care influenza testing; and initiate treatment when clinically appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Tests can miss flu infections in some cases. Anyone who has worsening or prolonged illness should seek medical care from a provider, regardless of flu test results. The standing orders also allow pharmacists to offer preventive treatment to high-risk individuals who have had a significant exposure to influenza within the past 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“This action reduces barriers for people who are feeling sick or have been exposed to someone with the influenza virus,” said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Dev Sangvai. “Being able to get tested and immediately treated at a pharmacy increases access for people who do not have a regular provider and will help make communities healthier during the respiratory virus season.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In addition to treatment, NCDHHS individuals will receive education on self-care strategies, measures to limit the spread of influenza, and information about when to seek follow-up care from a medical provider. Pharmacists will also send information from the visit to the individual’s primary care provider to help keep care coordinated. If they do not have a doctor, pharmacists will help connect them to one.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Flu season typically starts in October with peaks between December and February.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt; recommends people six months and older, with rare exceptions, to receive the vaccine. Officials say the vaccine is “trivalent” this season, meaning it protects against three strains of the flu virus.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS said fees may apply for the evaluation and any medications provided. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“While some private insurers may offer immediate coverage, we anticipate that coverage will expand over time,” NCDHHS said. “You should check with your pharmacy to ensure availability of pharmacists to test and treat the symptoms in the same visit. An appointment may be required.”&lt;/p&gt;

According to a 2022 meta-analysis, by University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) researchers, people with blood type A have a modestly higher risk of what experts call early-onset ischemic stroke. Here’s the lowdown — what the study found, what it doesn’t mean, and what you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the 2022 study discovered&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2022/um-school-of-medicine-researchers-find-blood-type-linked-to-risk-of-stroke-before-age-60.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Researchers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;pooled data from 48 genetic studies involving nearly 17,000 stroke patients (all under age 60) and almost 600,000 control participants who never had a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Understanding hypertension as a major risk factor for the heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with blood type A had about a 16% higher risk of early-onset ischemic stroke compared to those with other blood types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the flip side, those with blood type O had roughly a 12% lower risk of early stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The association was stronger in younger adults (under 60) than in people older than that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also noted that the increased risk is “modest” — this isn’t something that guarantees anything, just something that adds into your overall risk profile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does blood type A carry more risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t definitively pin down why type A has this edge when it comes to stroke risk, but there are some good clues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood clotting factors: People with non-O blood types (especially A) tend to have higher levels of certain proteins, like von Willebrand factor (vWF) and Factor VIII, which help blood clot. Bigger clot risk = higher chance of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic link: The locus (area) of the chromosome that codes for the ABO blood group was implicated in the analysis. That means the genetic “region for blood type” showed up as relevant in the stroke risk search. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But important: none of this proves causation. Having type A don’t cause stroke directly, it just appears associated. Lifestyle, environment, and other risk factors still play much larger roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What it doesn’t mean&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start panicking or making big health changes just because of your blood type, here are a few calming facts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk increase is relatively small. It’s not like having type A means you’ll definitely have a stroke. It’s just one factor among many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with blood type A aren’t recommended to undergo special screening just because of their type. Doctors aren’t saying you need extra tests solely based on this finding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest effects were in younger adults (&amp;lt;60). For older age groups, the blood type-stroke connection was weaker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should pay extra attention&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have blood type A, it's good to be informed. But what really matters is combining that with other known risks. These situations may increase risk more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have high blood pressure (hypertension)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you smoke or have a history of smoking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have high cholesterol or other cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, obesity, sedentary lifestyle)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have a family history of strokes or cardiovascular disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you can do to reduce your stroke risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood type is something you’re born with; you can’t change that. But you can control a lot of other factors. Whether you’re type A or not, here are smart moves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track your blood pressure regularly and keep it in a healthy range.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit smoking if you do, or avoid starting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat a heart-healthy diet — lean proteins, plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise regularly — even moderate activity helps protect against stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage medical conditions like diabetes, cholesterol, weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, blood type A does seem to bump up the risk of early ischemic stroke by about 16% compared to other blood groups, and type O seems to have a modest protective effect. But by itself, your blood type isn’t something to worry about in isolation. What really counts are all the other risk factors, lifestyle, medical history, and habits, that you can change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious, talk with your doctor about your individual risk, especially if you’re under 60, type A, and have other risks like high blood pressure or smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Indiatimes</author><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据芝加哥论坛报Lurie DOCTOR的研究，在第二次COVID-19感染后，儿童长期感染COVID的风险增加了一倍</title><link>https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/09/30/long-covid-children-lurie-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children are twice as likely to develop long COVID after two COVID-19 infections, compared with children who’ve only had COVID-19 once, according to a new study co-authored by a doctor at Lurie Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study come amid controversy over COVID-19 vaccines, especially for children, with the state and federal governments issuing differing recommendations about who should get the shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study offers one more reason why parents might want to get their kids vaccinated against COVID-19, said Dr. Ravi Jhaveri, head of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Lurie Children’s Hospital and a co-author of the study, which was published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Lancet Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of children and families that suffer from the various conditions that comprise long COVID,” Jhaveri said. “I think people tend to dismiss the omicron and beyond variants as not a big deal, not as bad as the original SARS-CoV-2 variants. While that’s largely true in terms of the severity of the respiratory illness, I think we can appreciate that it can still drive whatever processes lead to long COVID symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previous study from Jhaveri and others found that about 4% of kids who get COVID-19 develop long COVID, he said. Long COVID is a chronic condition that develops after a COVID-19 infection and lasts for at least three months, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of long COVID in children can be similar to those experienced by adults, such as brain fog, difficulty concentrating, fatigue or a rapid heart rate. More common symptoms in young children may include behavioral issues, irritability and asthma, Jhaveri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers behind the study published Tuesday analyzed the electronic health records of more than 465,000 children, looking at the prevalence of long COVID diagnoses and groups of symptoms common to long COVID, among kids who’d had one infection and kids who’d had two infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that the risk of certain long COVID symptoms in kids increased at different levels after a second infection. For example, the risk of myocarditis (swelling of the heart muscle) tripled with a second COVID-19 infection compared with just one infection. Blood clots were also more than twice as likely after a second infection versus a first.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;It’s long been known that adults who get multiple COVID-19 infections are at higher risk of developing long COVID and other problems, and it’s useful to know that also applies to children, said Dr. Joe Bailey, a pulmonologist with the Northwestern Medicine Comprehensive COVID-19 Center, who was not involved with the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is valuable because people have been thinking about kids and adults really differently when it comes to COVID,” Bailey said. “This is showing that there’s still a medical consequence of getting COVID, even in children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s publication comes on the heels of &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/09/24/illinois-issues-its-own-covid-19-vaccines-recommendations-breaking-with-federal-goverment/"&gt;Illinois releasing its own recommendations on COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; last week — guidance that broke with what the federal government has released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal advisory panel recently decided not to recommend COVID-19 vaccines at all, instead leaving it up to individuals whether to get the shots.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;That recommendation followed &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138"&gt;a May announcement&lt;/a&gt; by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., that COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children because of a “lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois, however, is recommending the COVID-19 vaccine this respiratory virus season for all children ages 6 to 23 months old and for children between the ages of 2 and 17 if they are in higher risk groups, or if their parents want them to have the shot — recommendations that are similar to those made by the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major health insurers have pledged to continue covering the vaccines this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study published Tuesday is part of an initiative funded by the National Institutes of Health that includes 40 U.S. children’s hospitals and health institutions and that aims to learn more about the long-term effects of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initiative is still receiving funding at this point, Jhaveri said, despite other cuts made to COVID-19 research and programs by the administration of President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement in March, as it announced &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/03/26/illinois-covid-19-money/"&gt;cuts to state and local health department efforts related to COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois and other states &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/04/01/trump-administration-sued-health-funding/"&gt;sued over those cuts&lt;/a&gt;, and a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction temporarily blocking the cuts in the states that sued.&lt;/p&gt;

Those folks are having trouble concentrating, remembering or making decisions — and the challenge is particularly bad among younger adults, ages 18 to 39.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nearly 1 in 10 in that age group are challenged, while the share over age 70 with similar struggles has actually gone down a little bit, according to a new study led by researchers at the University of Utah that was published in &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214226___.YzJ1OmJvbm5ldmlsbGVpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsOmM6bzplNGIyMTQ4Mzg3NTg5YjhjZDcwNDI4MzRjMGViOGNjYTo3OmM0OWY6Y2Y5MDkxZjEwNDk3ZGM3MTI1NDk2NDA4MDhkMTQzZTM5OTI2MWFhZWEyZDg4NjI4NDlmNjVkODUyM2Q2OGMwZDpoOlQ6Tg" target="_blank" rel="" title="Protected by Check Point: https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214226"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And before blame is placed on the stressful impacts of the pandemic, the researchers thought of that and dropped the responses collected from the year 2020, so the data wouldn’t be skewed, using the findings from every other year between 2013 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Lead author Ka-Ho Wong, a research associate of neuroimmunology in the University of Utah Department of Neurology, told Deseret News he was especially shocked by the change in rates of cognitive disability among those young adults, which nearly doubled, jumping from 5.1% to 9.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among adults 70 and older, cognitive disability decreased a little, from 7.3% to 6.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Because cognitive disability and depression often occur side by side, Wong said researchers also excluded those individuals who said they had depression, too. But that also means the increase in the number struggling with memory, concentration and decision-making could be higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Cognitive disability” is defined by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System — the source of the data the researchers analyzed — as “serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions because of a physical, mental or emotional condition.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And it’s now the most often-reported disability among U.S. adults. The researchers looked at national trends based on self reports, sorted and weighted by age, racial and ethnic populations and factors like poverty to be nationally representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-jump-in-cognitive-challenges" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A jump in cognitive challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Wong said the researchers were especially interested to see if the challenges were growing at the general population level, since much of the other research looks at clinical diagnosis. Theirs isn’t a clinical diagnosis, but rather a population-level assessment that involved data from 4.5 million survey responses over that decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The increase in the cognitive challenges began appearing back in 2016, according to Wong, who said he and his colleagues were not able to say what drove the differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But while no clear explanation of what changed was found, he added they did think of some possibilities. To definitively link them to the findings, however, would require more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He noted that both an increase in economic challenges or in reliance on digital devices could play a role. It’s also possible that younger adults don’t feel as much social stigma and are more willing to discuss and own their cognitive challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But it’s also likely that other factors, including illness and poor mental and physical health are contributing to the increase, as well. And there are other pressures, such as the fact that lots of people struggle with changes in job availability, for instance, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Lending credence to those ideas, the researchers noted the highest incidence among those with household incomes below $35,000 a year and those with chronic health conditions. The low-income group saw an increase over the decade from 8.8% to 12.6%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Facing-and-treating-health-issues" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Facing and treating health issues&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Health could be a significant factor, Wong told Deseret News, noting the possibility that high blood pressure, poor diet and other medical factors are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He said it’s important that health care providers look at those issues and consider the impact on patients because managing chronic conditions could prove vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the researchers, it’s important that people not hide their struggles, but rather talk to their family doctor or other health care providers to get help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We have found that individuals who have a chronic disease or condition such as stroke or high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol, those individuals are at a baseline higher rate of cognitive disability,” Wong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The findings suggest the steepest increase in memory and thinking problems are among these people who are already facing structural disadvantage and we need to really better understand and address these underlying social and economic factors that may be driving this trend,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study suggests that memory, focus and decision-making could all potentially improve if those conditions are managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 23:03:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOcWw0THZKVTU0MWJ1M21rdzNKNFYzX2lxeWlQQTJpbnVwb0hFRDIyNGpQaU5NV1pNdDNVWVhidTRqZEZLa0IzS2x6X1M1WTRDbE5VRUJsZS14cmwxc1R0Y3lJMXZjNGVPQmRrSFJ0eXdHNW1OTlhZS1Y3SmRKY0t0UnJDN1BPRFcyZWNBd25CanNwTF9leTgtcnhLYXV6XzQzUjQ0VTNadU9GNGJ1azFkdHlndDhTRTQ</guid></item><item><title>耳朵播种：古老的保健技术真的能让你的脸部消肿吗？ |抗病毒-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/01/ear-seeding-can-ancient-wellness-technique-really-de-puff-your-face</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;ikTok users have a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/16/cortisol-face-tiktok-cushings-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;well-known obsession&lt;/a&gt; with efforts to “de-puff” the face in the pursuit of a “snatched” jawline and to combat &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@alia.abk/video/7484321740718394632?q=face%20bloating&amp;amp;t=1759135477611" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“face bloating”&lt;/a&gt; and “cortisol face”, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/29/what-is-a-cortisol-detox-diet-can-it-help-stress-levels" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has already been debunked&lt;/a&gt; as not a medical term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest trend going viral is “ear seeding” – a needle-free form of acupuncture applying beads (often secured in place by adhesive) to stimulate pressure points in the ear that are supposed to target different body parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As one influencer, who has more than 5 million followers on the platform, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mireyarios/video/7547390919096454413" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;presses the seeds into her ear&lt;/a&gt; she tells her followers “this point really hurts”. She then directs them to “look at my jawline here” – pointing to the side where she has applied the seeds before turning her head so as to create a double chin on the other side, her voice noticeably lower with the strain – “versus here”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She is not alone, as many others also claim to see a difference. “I just watched the before and after and it’s definitely worked!” &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@abbimae_/video/7548495906824359190?_r=1&amp;amp;_t=ZS-906cVxUrSbA" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;another influencer tells her followers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="55ea2a82-cb59-44d2-bdfd-fdbd80a773ae" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Birth control: why are influencers turning away from the pill and towards natural contraceptive methods? | Antiviral","elementId":"55ea2a82-cb59-44d2-bdfd-fdbd80a773ae","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/birth-control-why-are-influencers-turning-away-from-the-pill-and-towards-natural-contraceptive-methods"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what do the experts say about this trend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-ear-seeding-and-where-does-it-come-from" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What is ear seeding and where does it come from?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lily Feng, an acupuncturist and the director of the Australian &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/acupuncture" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Acupuncture&lt;/a&gt; and Chinese Medicine Association, says ear seeding is a form of traditional Chinese medicine. Auricular acupuncture or auricular acupressure uses filiform needles, dermal needles, metal seeds or &lt;em&gt;Semen vaccariae&lt;/em&gt; seeds to apply physical pressure to stimulate auricular points. These points are supposed to correlate with body parts – based on the association between the ear’s shape and an inverted foetus – so stimulating the corresponding point of the ear can help achieve a therapeutic outcome elsewhere on the body, Feng says. “But it does not relate to cosmetic claims made online.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Jon Wardle, the director of the national centre for naturopathic medicine at Southern Cross University, says the trend co-opts traditional Chinese medicine. The difference is that “people are bypassing the practitioners and the expertise and recommending uses that may or may not be useful”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many influencers promote ear seeds customers can apply themselves at home. The trend’s popularity has led to beauty brands including Mecca offering gold ear seed therapy sessions with an acupuncturist – to add a “‘feel-good sparkle’ to your wellness path”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-does-the-evidence-show" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;What does the evidence show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Theone Papps, a dermatologist at the Skin hospital in Sydney, says there have been some randomised controlled trials where one group have ear seeding and another placebo group have tape and no seed, or nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A lot of these research studies come from China and Korea. The assumption is that ear seeding – like acupuncture – may trigger nerve reflexes, which may then release muscle tension, Papps says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most of the studies have been conducted on patients who have had surgery, she says – often jaw or dental surgery. “Many of these studies are positive in that they show that there is improvement in pain and anxiety … but there’s not enough robust research with regards to facial de-puffing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Associate Prof Deshan Sebaratnam, another dermatologist at the Skin hospital, says there is no evidence to support that ear seeds can sculpt or lift the face, nor evidence that pressing on an ear can help with respiratory, digestive or endocrine issues, as is sometimes claimed in ear seed marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-any-harms-from-ear-seeding" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Are there any harms from ear seeding?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Papps says considers ear seeds a “low-risk treatment” but cautions that excessive repeated pressure could cause trauma to the cartilage. If the tape is left on too long it could can dryness or irritation to the skin. To people who want to use ear seeds, she advises avoiding excessive pressure when applying them and maintaining hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wardle agrees that the therapy in itself is not harmful but harm could come if people used it to address symptoms related to an underlying medical issue, ignoring other treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c2e79566-3bdf-4bef-bef7-2b469a668bf3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":18,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"A meaty topic: what is the carnivore diet and why do so many influencers seem to swear by it? | Antiviral","elementId":"c2e79566-3bdf-4bef-bef7-2b469a668bf3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/03/what-is-carnivore-diet-meat-benefits-science-does-work-why-so-many-influencers"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The regulations for unregistered health practitioners require them to avoid monopolising the care of a patient and not discourage multidisciplinary care where appropriate, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-reasons-to-be-worried-about-a-puffy-face" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Are there reasons to be worried about a puffy face?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Facial puffing can be serious if it is due to underlying medical conditions, Papps says, such as thyroid malfunction, kidney problems that cause fluid retention or hormonal changes, as well as dermatological issues including cutaneous sarcoidosis and skin lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If it’s persistent and not responding to some simple measures, it is, of course, always important to have a review with a medical professional to make sure anything serious is excluded,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But “a lot of people wake up quite puffy in the morning, and a lot of that’s just gravity and poor lymphatic flow”, she says. “The lymphatics drain all of our toxins – it’s basically the plumbing system to eliminate a lot of the junk that’s in our body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If someone has ruled out any other serious causes of facial puffiness, Papps recommends trying simple solutions like elevation – sleeping on a few extra pillows. Facial massage can also promote circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sebaratnam says: “Most people do not need to do anything extra to help clear their lymphatics – your body does this naturally.” But in certain situations, he said, for instance for patients who have had their lymph nodes removed because of cancer surgery, some people find that massage can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span data-dcr-style="bullet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/antiviral" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Antiviral&lt;/a&gt; is a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="993177f9-76fa-4ff0-972f-b21f2f1cb4d9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Share your experience","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"993177f9-76fa-4ff0-972f-b21f2f1cb4d9","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

&lt;h2&gt;Switching names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2022, the WHO decided to change the name. The United Nations health agency noted that it had received reports from individuals and countries about the "racist and stigmatizing language online, in other settings, and in some communities." The WHO decided to switch to the name "mpox" with a one-year grace period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency also clarified its authority to make such a change, saying: "Assigning names to new and, very exceptionally, to existing diseases is the responsibility of WHO under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and the WHO Family of International Health Related Classifications through a consultative process which includes WHO Member States."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO does not, however, have the authority to change the names of viruses. That power belongs to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which has not changed the name of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the virus remains the same, the world has shifted to using mpox to discuss the disease. The &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240525134901/https:/www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/index.html"&gt;US CDC&lt;/a&gt; followed suit, changing its websites and health information to use the new name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, however, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/monkeypox/index.html"&gt;reverted to monkeypox&lt;/a&gt;. The change was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/09/12/g-s1-88287/mpox-monkeypox-virus-stigma"&gt;first reported by NPR&lt;/a&gt;. When journalists have asked about the change, the Department of Health and Human Services (which includes the CDC) has responded only by saying "Monkeypox is the name of the viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus," which is not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

Once inside, they attach to the intestinal wall, causing inflammation and interfering with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Disturbingly, microplastics have been detected in human feces and even gallstones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The average person unknowingly consumes an amount equivalent to the size of a credit card every week. This exposure has been linked to reduced good gut bacteria, increased harmful microbes, and a compromised immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Our gut health is deeply connected to our overall well-being, from how we digest food to how we fight off disease. By damaging the gut lining and allowing toxins into the bloodstream, microplastics may increase the risk of chronic illnesses, infections, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, the disruption of healthy gut bacteria can weaken the immune system, making the body more vulnerable to a range of health issues beyond just digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"These findings reinforce the urgent need for public awareness and stricter policies to reduce plastic pollution," said Dr. Ravindra Khaiwal, who led the study.

&lt;p&gt;The MIT team proposed that a BEC of radioactive atoms—say, rubidium-83—could radioactively decay in sync to produce a laser beam. Neutrinos are released naturally during radioactive decay, and in the quantum BEC state, that decay should accelerate, an effect that should produce an amplified beam of neutrinos akin to how stimulated emission amplifies photons to produce a conventional laser beam. The next step is to build a tabletop demonstration of the concept. If that works, the team envisions using neutrino lasers as a new tool for underground communication and as a source of radioisotopes for medical imaging and cancer diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest forms of the pinhole camera have been around for millennia, dating as far back as the 4th century BCE in China. Light passes through a tiny hole punched into a light-proof box, projecting an inverted image of the scene outside onto the opposite interior wall. Lens-based imaging is prone to distortion and has limitations on depth of field and wavelength. So scientists have revived the pinhole technology to create a prototype pinhole camera for infrared imaging, according to &lt;a href="https://opg.optica.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-12-9-1478&amp;amp;id=577004"&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Optica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make their IR pinhole imaging system, the authors used a laser to create an optical hole inside a nonlinear crystal with a "chirped-period" structure capable of gathering light rays from a wide range of directions, resulting in a wider field of view. The crystal's unique optical properties essentially convert infrared images into visible light, making it possible for a standard silicon camera to record those images. The process also naturally suppresses noise, so it can work even in low-light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their prototype, the team used 3D time-of-flight IR imaging to image a matte ceramic rabbit and reconstruct its 3D shape by synchronizing ultrafast pulses. The IR pinhole camera can even be adapted to far-infrared or terahertz wavelengths. It's still very much in the proof-of-concept stage, but once their innovation makes IR imaging systems more affordable, portable, and energy-efficient, the authors envision applications in night vision, industrial quality control, and environmental monitoring, among other uses.&lt;/p&gt;

Just take the way that one adorable pup was watching over her favorite little human so carefully. The dog was so concerned when her dad started burping the little baby. Was he hurting the poor thing? The dog was scared! She can’t take it when someone cries. And her concern has people online totally smitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caoimhe has a tender heart when it comes to her humans. She doesn’t like to see them in pain. Crying specifically really tears her up inside. Which is why she was upset when she heard the tiny human getting fussy. Have no fear, little one! Caoimhe is there for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like the dog was the baby’s personal bodyguard. She wasn’t letting dad get away with anything, that’s for sure. The dog was keeping a watchful eye over the infant as her father patted her back to get her to burp. But we guess the man was using a little too much force for the dog’s liking, because she put her paw up to get him to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/protective-american-bully-big-brother-crying-newborn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Protective American Bully Is the Best Big Brother to Crying Newborn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: Protective American Bully Is the Best Big Brother to Crying Newborn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not hurting her,” the man explained. “I’m trying to make her burp, Magoo,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something tells us that the dog wasn’t convinced! Commenters were positively tickled by the overprotective pooch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dad out here on supervised visits only,” joked one commenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That poor dog is about to call Paw Patrol on y’all,” someone else teased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dog is probably like ‘that’s enough, no more slaps,’” a third commenter wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You know what, hit on my baby one more time, and we will have a problem buddy,” added another commenter, as if speaking for the pup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Do Dogs Become Overprotective?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just Caoimhe who gets a little touchy around her favorite baby. Many dogs become &lt;a href="https://wagwalking.com/behavior/why-do-dogs-become-overprotective" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:overprotective;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;overprotective&lt;/a&gt; of their humans. There are  a few different reasons why this happens, one of which is that overprotective dogs can sometimes be jealous. If your dog received a lot of attention when they were young, they might feel jealous when another dog (or human) is getting the attention that they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time your pup is a little territorial, just keep in mind they might be feeling jealous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more PetHelpful updates?

This can cause pain, muscle weakness, sensory problems, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We did a lot of physical therapy three times a week, and occupational therapy every week. It’s been a wild ride. He just started walking again in April of 2024 last year. He was walking again and quickly learned how to run,” Grover says. “Every three months we would go to Lehi, Utah, down to the new Primary Children’s Clinic, which is incredible, to get Botox shots in his joints to keep him from stiffening up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even through the rollercoaster of health setbacks, Grover says Carter is a loving, funny, and energetic kid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Carter is just so happy to be alive. He’s got a little attitude of course, but who doesn’t these days? He loves dancing, he loves music, he loves all animals,” Grover says. “He’s just so playful and happy, and he always needs to be right there with me in everything that I do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 22, Carter’s grandmother, Laurie Peterson, was driving him to his physical therapy appointment, which he goes to three times a week in Rexburg, when she suffered a medical emergency while driving near the intersection on Salem Road at 3000 North. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eastidahonews.com/2025/09/road-closed-as-officials-investigate-three-vehicle-crash-involving-tractor-in-rexburg/"&gt;RELATED | Road closed as officials investigate three-vehicle crash involving tractor in Rexburg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson.jpg" alt="Laurie Peterson and Carter Grover during Carter's first appointment at Primary Children's Hospital. | Courtesy Katherine Grover" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781359" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-300x200.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-860x573.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-750x500.jpg 750w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GroverandPeterson-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Laurie Peterson and Carter Grover during Carter’s first appointment at Primary Children’s Hospital. | Courtesy Katherine Grover&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“She suffered a stroke that led to her being unable to stop properly at the stop sign and was hit by another oncoming vehicle. It did, unfortunately, involve a hay-baler,” Grover says. “We do feel like the vehicle rolled, but we aren’t sure. They were both wearing seatbelts at the time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six people were transported to the hospital, including Carter and his grandmother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grover was at Costco when she received the call from law enforcement, learning that her mother and son had been in a serious car crash and were both unconscious at the scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They were rushed to EIRMC in Idaho Falls, and somehow (Peterson) had become coherent enough to give them my name and phone number,” Grover says. “Shortly after that, she crashed and had to be intubated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shortly after being rushed to EIRMC, Carter was life-flighted to Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The accident caused a spinal cord tear in the C1 and C2 of (Carter’s) spine, and his C5 and C6 were also damaged,” Grover explains. “Due to the severity of the spinal cord tear, it has left Carter paralyzed from the neck down, and he is unable to breathe on his own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Katherine, doctors have given Carter a difficult prognosis. Still, the family says they are choosing to keep hope alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The chances of him being able to walk again and breathe on his own again are pretty slim,” Grover says. “But, he is extremely cognizant of his brain. Activity is excellent, and he is awake, and he is communicating with me and the nurses and doctors with his eyes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/family.jpg" alt="Carter Grover (left) with his grandmother, Laurie Peterson, brother William Grover, and mother, Katherine Grover. | Courtesy of Katherine Grover" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781360" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/family.jpg 534w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/family-267x300.jpg 267w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/family-445x500.jpg 445w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;(Left to right) Carter Grover with his grandmother, Laurie Peterson, brother William Grover, and mother, Katherine Grover. | Courtesy of Katherine Grover&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Grover says she has been staying with Carter in Utah, while her sister, Emily Gonzales, has been with their mother, as she is in critical condition in the ICU at EIRMC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gonzales says Peterson has suffered multiple strokes and is not “out of the woods yet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, she did suffer multiple strokes, and those were on the left side of her brain,” Gonzales says. “She’s got a long road of recovery as well. She has two broken collar bones, a fractured sternum, broken ribs, fractured pelvis, a laceration to her spleen, and two pneumothoraxes, so she’s got holes in each lung.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite all the challenges, the sisters say that the community’s support has been overwhelming, and they have been flooded with help from family and friends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am just so humbled and honored to have such amazing and incredible people in my life,” Grover says. “Carter’s preschool came, they made him pictures and a big poster that everybody signed and drew on. And they brought a bunch of books and they brought Carter’s favorite stuffed lion.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gonzales, who owns The Neighborhood Barber in Idaho Falls, says she was recently grateful to learn that her coworkers had planned a fundraiser for Carter titled “Cuts for Carter.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon.jpg" alt="The Cut for Carter fundraiser. | Facebook" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781358" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-300x300.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-150x150.jpg 150w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-860x860.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-500x500.jpg 500w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-600x600.jpg 600w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-100x100.jpg 100w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cutathon-250x250.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Cut for Carter fundraiser. | Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“My team has just been so incredibly amazing, and they want to help and support,” Gonzales says. “They started a cut-a-thon that they’re hosting at my shop on Oct. 11th, and all the proceeds they get from that day are going to be donated towards Carter’s recovery and to help my sister out with whatever she needs while she’s in Utah.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gonzales also started a GoFundMe to raise money for Carter’s medical treatment, recovery, and other expenses while the family is in Utah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-carters-healing-journey"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click here to donate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe.jpg" alt="The GoFundMe organized to raise money for Carter's medical expenses. | GoFundMe" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-781374" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-300x212.jpg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-768x543.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-860x608.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-708x500.jpg 708w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CarterGoFundMe-600x424.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Carter has really surprised so many doctors and has overcome every challenge that he has been faced with,” Gonzales says. “As he’s grown older, he just keeps proving doctors, and everybody wrong.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grover says she wants the community to know that her mother is strong and an inspiration to the family, which keeps them believing that she will fully recover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She’s an amazing woman.

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not a doctor, but I am passionate about this stuff in my own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Exercise, sleep, and diet. Plus a zillion different supplements and medicines as adjuncts to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, consider what inflammation &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;. It's fundamentally an immune response designed to attack unhealthy tissue and to facilitate repair of healthy tissue - the effects of inflammation are largely driven by cytokines like TNF-alpha (which is responsible for killing unhealthy cells and recruiting immune cells), IL-1 (which recruits immune cells), and IL-6 (which drives cRP production - the biomarker that you usually look for to gauge systemic inflammation). The production of these is mediated by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other major factors are things like reactive oxygen species (or "free radicals"), which can oxidize all sorts of things in the body and cause damage (which is good when the thing being damaged is a pathogen or damaged cell, bad when it's healthy tissue). Damaged tissue provokes immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to "reduce inflammation", you want to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Reduce stimuli or downregulate processes which are causing the production of inflammatory cytokines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Upregulate the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Ensure sufficient antioxidant capacity to deal with ROS production and oxidative stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've got a chronic illness or autoimmune disorder, you're dealing with inflammation just because your "make immune defenses" signals are stuck on. But you can also have chronic inflammation through too much fat (adipose tissue is an endocrine organ!), environmental or diet factors, or just behaviors which result in an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the body (for example: smoking induces consistent tissue damage, which drives immune responses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise upregulates production of anti-inflammatory cytokines and improves mitochondrial efficiency, which results in less ROS production during cellular respiration. Sugar surges cause elevated ROS production, and chronically-elevated blood glucose results in insulin resistance, which promotes inflammatory cytokine production. Lipopolysaccharides from gut bacteria in the bloodstream stimulate immune responses. Insufficient sleep upregulates NF-kB directly, but also contributes to dysfunction of other systems which can upregulate NF-kB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're sleeping plenty, eating well, and exercising, and you don't have a chronic health condition, your inflammation levels are probably pretty good. But you can generally further reduce them with supplementation of things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Omega-3 fatty acids (which compete with omega-6 fatty acids - "seed oils", which produce inflammatory prostaglandins) - this is why your doctor wants you to take fish oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Turmeric, resveratrol, and green tea extracts (which contain compounds which inhibit NF-kB and are ROS scavengers),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Vitamin D (which inhibits cytokine production and supports your natural antioxidant systems)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* NAC, which replenishes glutathione (the primary driver of the body's antioxidant systems)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are medications, of course, like your regular old aspirin and ibuprofen, which reduce prostoglandin production (which is one upstream of NF-kB), corticosteroids (which block NF-kB), as well as more exotic entries such as GLP-1 peptides (which, among other things, improve insulin sensitivty and reduce adipose tissue, which results in reduced systemic inflammation) or BPC-157 peptides (which acutely inhibit NF-kB, upregulate antioxidant enzymes, and help regulate nitrous oxide, which is how they can help heal NSAID-induced leisons).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is by no means comprehensive - there are plenty more mechanisms and interventions to explore - but it should be a pretty good clue as to why "diet and exercise" are standard health advice. You don't want to turn &lt;i&gt;off&lt;/i&gt; your inflammation responses - they're responsible for taking out pathogens, killing tumors and maintaining a healthy body - but you don't want them chronically upregulated, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class="athing comtr" id="45431696"&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;table border="0"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="ind" indent="0"&gt;&lt;img src="s.gif"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign="top" class="votelinks"&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a id="up_45431696" href="vote?id=45431696&amp;amp;how=up&amp;amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45430498"&gt;&lt;p class="votearrow" title="upvote"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="default"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Olson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, director of the IPN and a professor of chemistry, biochemistry and molecular medicine at UC Davis. “But it’s a little more nuanced than that in terms of who can really benefit and who might be at risk. There are different patient populations.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With mental illness being the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States, the research lays a critical foundation in the search for a viable therapeutic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is an urgent need for treatments in the postpartum period,” said study co-author and IPN affiliate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurotherapeutics.ucdavis.edu/people/danielle-stolzenberg"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Danielle Stolzenberg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an associate professor of psychology at UC Davis. “I think most importantly what we’ve learned is that the effects of psychedelics can differ based on the ovarian hormone context and that is a critically important finding.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not only were psylocibin’s negative impacts long-lasting in mouse mothers (persisting for two weeks after a single dose), but the researchers also found that offspring raised by psylocibin-treated mothers also exhibited anxiety and depression-like symptoms long into adulthood. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The finding suggests that the mothers passed on those negative effects via lactation, permanently stunting the offspring’s neurodevelopment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A one-of-a-kind mouse model for postpartum depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was built around Stolzenberg’s innovative mouse model of postpartum depression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the model, mouse mothers live with their offspring in a two-cage system that allows them to escape from the demands of motherhood. Stolzenberg found that repeated exposure to a social threat (a male mouse) destabilizes maternal behavior, leading to infant avoidance and triggering other stress responses. These symptoms are hallmarks of postpartum depression in humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One of the things that’s discussed consistently in the clinical literature is that moms often feel like they have trouble bonding with their infants when they’re experiencing depressive symptoms,” Stolzenberg said. “The mouse moms in the social stress paradigm spend significantly more time in the cage without the pups. They will often run back and forth to check on them but tend to actively avoid their infants for long periods of time.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team initially thought the treatment might help alleviate postpartum depression symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Psilocybin was of such interest for us because it’s been demonstrated to be useful across a whole host of mental disorders, including addressing anxiety and depression,” said study first-author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurotherapeutics.ucdavis.edu/people/cassandra-hatzipantelis"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cassandra Hatzipantelis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow at the IPN. “We thought it could have the ability to address things that go wrong in postpartum depression like parent-infant connection.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, psilocybin induced the opposite effect, having both negative behavioral impacts on mothers and their offspring. Mouse mothers continued avoiding their offspring and displaying anxiety and depressive-like symptoms. These symptoms persisted after mice were separated from their offspring. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Two weeks after a single dose of psylocibin, the mothers were dramatically impaired,” Hatzipantelis said. “We were shocked.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Psilocybin-treated mice, the researchers found, were at higher risk for behavioral impairments and depressive-like symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was very surprised that we saw the moms getting worse,” Olson said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virgin female mice did not show such effects. The findings indicate that there may be distinct neurochemical differences in the brains of mouse mothers that led to psilocybin producing adverse effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We know that ovarian hormones regulate serotonergic signaling, but we understand very little about the interaction between ovarian hormones and drugs that impact serotonin,” said Stolzenberg, noting that the latter is critical to how psychedelics affect the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passing on negative effects to offspring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team also found that behavioral effects were passed to the offspring. Nine weeks after weaning, both male and female offspring exhibited pronounced measures of anxiety and depression compared to the control groups. Their brains also showcased traces of psilocin — a metabolite of psilocybin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We now know that even low doses of exposure can impact offspring for long periods of time,” Stolzenberg said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study highlights the IPN’s commitment to studying both the positive and negative effects of psychedelics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These could be really important therapeutics, but we also realize they have limitations, and we have to conduct rigorous science to understand what those limitations are,” Olson said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since its launch in 2023, the IPN has attracted nearly 80 UC Davis faculty affiliates spanning diverse fields from anthropology and chemistry to neuropharmacology and genomics. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“UC Davis has incredible experts across a breadth of fields and in specialized domains,” Olson said. “That’s why we can do this type of high impact, interdisciplinary science. It’s really the people.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additional study authors include Min Liu, Adam Love, Sadie J.

Published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03544-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the research also documented notable improvements in the participants’ overall well-being and their performance on several cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was prompted by the rising prevalence of major depression, particularly on college campuses. Existing treatments, such as psychotherapy and medication, are effective for many but do not help everyone and can come with unwanted side effects. Researchers led by Drew D. Decker at The Ohio State University sought to explore a different approach, one that addresses the potential link between metabolic health and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence connects issues like insulin resistance and excess body fat to an increased risk of depression, possibly through inflammatory pathways. The team hypothesized that a dietary intervention known to improve metabolic health, the very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, might serve as a beneficial add-on therapy for students already receiving treatment for depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed as a single-arm prospective trial, meaning all participants received the same dietary intervention without a comparison control group. Researchers recruited students from The Ohio State University who had been formally diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and were currently engaged in counseling or taking medication for their condition. After an extensive screening process to confirm eligibility and rule out conditions like eating disorders, 24 students began the study, with 16 completing the full 10 to 12 week intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we really wanted to make sure of is that we were providing a treatment for people who met the diagnostic criteria for having major depressive disorder,” said co-author Jennifer Cheavens, a professor of clinical psychology at Ohio State who oversaw the clinical assessments. “Each participant had about a 2 1/2-hour interview at the beginning, and then weekly assessments of their symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting the diet, each participant received a detailed educational session. The well-formulated ketogenic diet required them to limit carbohydrate intake to less than 50 grams per day, consume a moderate amount of protein, and get the rest of their calories from fat, with an emphasis on whole food sources like olive oil, nuts, and fatty fish. To help with adherence and offset costs, the research team provided some staple ketogenic foods and ongoing support from dietitians through a secure messaging application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very important to make sure participants knew what they were getting themselves into,” said Drew Decker, the study’s first author. “And a big part of increasing chances for adherence to the diet was talking to each individual about what they like and don’t like to eat so we could tailor some suggestions for how they could structure their diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study, researchers tracked several outcomes. Participants self-reported their depressive symptoms bi-weekly using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. A qualified clinician also rated their depression at the start, midpoint, and end of the study using the Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression. To confirm they were following the diet, students measured their morning blood ketone and glucose levels daily. Researchers also assessed body composition using scans, collected blood samples to analyze for markers related to metabolism and inflammation, and administered a battery of cognitive tests on an iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a robust and sustained decrease in depression symptoms. Among the 16 students who completed the study, self-reported depression scores dropped by an average of 69 percent from the beginning to the end of the intervention. Clinician-rated scores showed a similar 71 percent reduction. Every participant who completed the study showed an improvement in their depression scores, and by the end, no one met the criteria for moderate or severe depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Patel, a psychiatrist at Ohio State who met with the students during the trial, noted the significance of these changes. “The average effect size for medications and counseling after 12 weeks is about 50%, and we saw a substantially greater result,” he said. “That is an impressive finding, that across the board, in this real-world setting, everybody got better, and across the board, our participants did not need more treatment or emergency intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside the mental health improvements, participants experienced physical changes. Fifteen of the 16 students lost a clinically significant amount of weight, with an average loss of five kilograms, or about 11 pounds. This weight loss was predominantly from body fat. Blood analysis revealed a 32 percent increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein important for neuron health, and a 52 percent decrease in leptin, a hormone related to body fat and appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet was also associated with better cognitive function. Participants showed significant improvements on tests measuring episodic memory, processing speed, and executive functions. For example, they were able to recall more words from a list and complete symbol-matching tasks more quickly at the end of the study compared to the beginning. Their self-reported global well-being also increased nearly threefold over the course of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explored whether the improvements in depression were simply a result of weight loss or the presence of ketones in the blood. They found no significant statistical correlation, suggesting the diet’s positive effects on mood may stem from more complex biological changes rather than weight loss alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea is that the ketogenic diet is working through a variety of potentially different mechanisms, there’s a whole range of physiological metabolic adaptations to the diet that could overlap with some of the pathophysiology of depression,” explained Jeff Volek, the study’s senior author and a professor of human sciences at The Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors acknowledge several limitations. The single-arm design means it is not possible to definitively separate the effects of the diet from the participants’ ongoing counseling and medication, or from the simple passage of time. The small sample size and the fact that participants volunteered for a diet study could also influence the results. Additionally, repeated cognitive testing can sometimes lead to better scores due to practice, an effect that could not be ruled out without a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is needed to confirm these findings in larger, randomized controlled trials that can more clearly isolate the diet’s impact. Such studies could also help identify the specific biological mechanisms responsible for the observed benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the researchers see the results as a promising step toward new treatment options. “We have a treatment gap in that we have more students suffering from mental health concerns than can feasibly receive professional treatment,” Patel said. “There is a need for finding ways of helping students on a large scale. And nutrition is one way we can do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volek added that the study provides a solid foundation for further investigation. “So many people are suffering right now, so it’s rewarding to potentially bring forward a solution,” he said. “This is one of the first really well-controlled studies and it has limitations, but the results encourage us to want to keep pursuing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-025-03544-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A pilot study examining a ketogenic diet as an adjunct therapy in college students with major depressive disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Drew D.

But what’s even more concerning is that the illness is more serious than many parents realize. &lt;strong&gt;“Many kids can have complications including dehydration or bacterial infections such as pneumonia,” says &lt;a href="https://www.cooperhealth.org/doctors/april-douglass-bright-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:April Douglass-Bright, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;April Douglass-Bright, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the division of general pediatrics at &lt;a href="https://www.cooperhealth.org/services/childrens-regional-hospital" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Children’s Regional Hospital at Cooper University Health Care;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Children’s Regional Hospital at Cooper University Health Care&lt;/a&gt;. “The flu also can cause pediatric deaths.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While kids with &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/chronic/Pages/Flu-A-Guide-for-Parents-of-Children-or-Adolescents-With-Chronic-Health-Conditions.aspx?_gl=1%2A1m3fn3e%2A_ga%2AMTIzNDQ4NjY0My4xNzU3MDk3NDYy%2A_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ%2AczE3NTcwOTk4NTIkbzIkZzAkdDE3NTcwOTk4NTIkajYwJGwwJGgw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:underlying health conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;underlying health conditions&lt;/a&gt; such as asthma are especially at risk for flu-related complications, even healthy kids can be affected. “As adults, we build our immune systems every time we get sick, but babies and kids are at risk because their immune systems are not fully developed,” says &lt;a href="https://nursing.rutgers.edu/profile/daniela-moscarella/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daniela Moscarella, D.N.P.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daniela Moscarella, D.N.P.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant clinical professor at &lt;a href="https://nursing.rutgers.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rutgers Health School of Nursing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rutgers Health School of Nursing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;“They get everything quickly and more severely.

The heartbreaking reality is that so much of this can be prevented with the flu vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, last year was one of the most severe flu seasons since 2017-2018. “&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-29.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 266 influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported during the 2024–2025 season,” says Faulkner. “Alarmingly, 90% of these children were not fully vaccinated.” Last year, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:49.2% of children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;49.2% of children&lt;/a&gt; ages 6 months through 17 years received the shot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Witthaya Prasongsin - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is the best time for your child to get a flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, flu season runs from October to May, so the best time to get a flu shot is in the fall. “It takes two weeks to be effective, so, &lt;strong&gt;ideally, plan to get your child’s shot sometime in September to early October,”&lt;/strong&gt; says Moscarella. But because flu season runs so long and peaks in February or March, &lt;strong&gt;even later in the season isn’t “too late” to get the vaccine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also especially important for kids who are going into day care or school for the first time to be vaccinated because they’ll be in close contact with others, sharing lunches and so on, says Douglass-Bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s equally vital for &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/tips-tools/ask-the-pediatrician/Pages/Do-college-students-and-teens-need-a-flu-shot.aspx#:~:text=Answer,will%20not%20protect%20against%20flu." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthy young adults entering college;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthy young adults entering college&lt;/a&gt; and dorm life to be vaccinated, says Moscarella. Although they may already have left for school before your doctor’s office received the vaccines (which typically is in late August), many campuses offer flu vaccination clinics, so encourage your older child to prioritize getting the shot, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Karl Tapales - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does your child need two doses of the flu shot?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends. Starting from the age of six months, your child can receive the flu vaccine. Your child may need more than one dose, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/hcp/vax-summary/vaccine-dosage-admin.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended dosing schedule;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;recommended dosing schedule&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, this year the &lt;strong&gt;intranasal needle-free spray for people ages 2 to 49 years &lt;/strong&gt;is available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An annual flu vaccination is recommended for all children over the age of six months and it's best to get it done in September or October for maximum protection. However, if they receive a flu shot later in the season it can still be protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 17:38:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE1LcG1oaV9DM2c1enphd2RnRkN4dTdYaGhWbDJCeG9OSHF5T09La1JyRUhPdk1RQ1JpQUdKNXNoTFpJS2FvUk5EeE53S0ZtYlNabHNfLWItMTZta0J5U0hxRGdNZThlYUxtclpMYVE1UVQ5OWFpWi1J</guid></item><item><title>抗衰老$ 1补充剂可将心脏病死亡风险降低近三分之一-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15146135/Anti-aging-supplement-slashes-risk-heart-disease.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists at one of America's top hospitals have found that a compound found in cocoa can dramatically protect the heart, reducing the risk of cardiovascular death by nearly a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-3e23a620-9d7a-11f0-9ffd-db4034e82741"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; tested the ability of cocoa extract supplements to reduce markers of inflammation in people’s blood that raise the risks of heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, cognitive decline and dementia, type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-3e1db2b0-9d7a-11f0-9ffd-db4034e82741"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and age-related muscle wasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flavanols are considered the key active component behind &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12135965/Six-squares-dark-chocolate-day-memory-loss-bay.html"&gt;the anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; properties observed in the cocoa extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flavanols directly neutralize free radicals, or unstable molecules that cause stress and damage cells, which is a significant trigger for inflammation, suppress the production of pro-inflammatory proteins like the cytokines mentioned in the study and reduce the activation of genes that are involved in the inflammatory response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the course of a year, the group taking the cocoa extract saw an eight percent drop in a key marker of inflammation compared to the group taking the placebo, reducing their overall &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11053191/Good-news-dark-chocolate-lovers-scientists-cocoa-lower-blood-pressure.html"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe that cocoa extract supplements, which are priced between $15 and $45, could be the solution for slowing ‘inflammaging,’ a term they coined by combining ‘inflammation’ and ‘aging.’ It describes the chronic, low-grade, and systemic inflammation that slowly builds up in the body as people get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yanbin Dong, senior study author and director of Augusta University's Georgia Prevention Institute, said in a statement: ‘While cocoa extract is not a replacement for a healthy lifestyle, these results are encouraging and highlight its potential role in modulating inflammation as we age.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cocoa flavanol supplements are widely available for purchase online and in health food stores, vitamin shops and pharmacies, but supplements are not regulated tightly and therefore buyers can never be absolutely certain that what they are buying is both safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers at a top American hospital have discovered that a natural compound in chocolate can dramatically reduce the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by nearly 30 percent (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Howard Sesso, associate director of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/cocoa-extract-reduces-inflammation-aging"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: 'We also appreciate the important overlap between healthy aging and cardiovascular health, where aging-related inflammation can harden arteries and lead to cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because of that, we wanted to see whether multi-year cocoa extract supplementation versus a placebo could modulate inflammaging—and the data suggests it does.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article-abstract/54/9/afaf269/8253933?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false"&gt;Age and Ageing&lt;/a&gt;, come as part of the COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cosmostrial.org/results/"&gt;COSMOS&lt;/a&gt;), a landmark clinical trial investigating the health effects of cocoa flavanols by taking 500mg of cocoa extract supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists identified five different markers in the body that play different roles in the generation and reduction of inflammation that affects the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that cocoa extract had a targeted effect. It significantly reduced levels of hsCRP, a key marker of systemic inflammation associated with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two years, the group taking the cocoa extract saw a significant, year-over-year drop of 8.4 percent in hsCRP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, it increased levels of IFN-γ, a marker that plays a vital role in the immune system, stimulating immune cells and 'killer' cells to protect against infections and clear tumor cells from the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three other markers remained mostly unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Flavanols are the key anti-inflammatory component in cocoa extract.

          &lt;p&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How’s anal with&lt;/strong&gt; someone with pearls in their dick? I’m getting some installed soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;You’re referring to pearling, a body modification where small pearl-like beads are inserted under the skin of the penis. Post-pearling, your cock — to the untrained eye (read: most eyes) — is gonna look like it’s covered in cysts that could burst at any moment. Since I’ve never had anal with someone who had their dick modified in this way, I can’t tell you what it’s like. And before you can find out what it’s like, you’re gonna have to convince someone to let you fuck them with what looks like a cyst-covered cock. Good luck with that. (But if you do get the procedure done and manage to find someone who’ll let you fuck them, please come on my new mini podcast After Action Report — coming very soon to the podcast feed at &lt;a href="https://savage.love/lovecast/"&gt;Savage.Love&lt;/a&gt; — and tell me all about it!)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="inline-ad my-4 py-2 text-center" id="div-gpt-ad-native-inline-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;P.S. I don’t mean to be kink-negative here — I’ve seen people put far crazier looking things up their butts than a pearled cock, and sex shops sell ass toys with bumps and ridges because people like how bumps and ridges feel. So, your pearled cock may be in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;a name="more"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;2. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Pete Buttigieg&lt;/strong&gt; more electable with a beard?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;I don’t think anyone would buy Pete Buttigieg pulling a &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/tim-scott-mindy-noce-married-wedding.html"&gt;Tim Scott&lt;/a&gt; and getting himself a wife to make himself more electable — that is the kind of &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gay+Beard"&gt;beard&lt;/a&gt; you meant, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p class="inline-ad my-4 border-bottom border-top py-4 text-center" id="div-gpt-ad-inline-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;3. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My husband and&lt;/strong&gt; I are about to open our marriage. He wants to have sex with men. This will probably only happen four times a year at most. Should he get on PrEP? Should he take doxy after each encounter? I asked him to wear a condom, and he agreed, although I know that wouldn’t be his preference. What’s the best way for him to protect himself and me as we move into this next chapter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;For maximum protection, your husband should get on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/prep.html"&gt;PrEP&lt;/a&gt; (a daily pill that prevents HIV infection) and have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/hcp/doxy-pep/index.html"&gt;Doxy PEP&lt;/a&gt; on hand (two pills taken after a sexual encounter that decreases the risk of contracting syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) and insist on using condoms. If your husband is only having sex with men four times a year — and he’s scheduling those sex dates in advance — he could opt for PrEP on demand: taking two pills (Truvada or Descovy) 24 hours before he has sex with a man, another pill the day after, and one last pill two days after. But if your husband has poor impulse control — if he’s likely to jump on a dick if the opportunity presents itself — then he should be on daily PrEP.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;4. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to ask&lt;/strong&gt; a partner to wash their vulva better? Is there ever a nice way to say it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="inline-ad my-4 border-bottom border-top py-4 text-center" id="div-gpt-ad-inline-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;When my husband’s junk doesn’t smell great, I can say, “Hey, you stink,” and tell him to jump in the shower — and he can say the same to me. But we can afford to be blunt because men haven’t been told for centuries (millennia!) that our genitals are smelly and unclean. So, you’ll have to be more tactful. Open by acknowledging how fraught this is and then emphasize that your first concern is for her health. Then say it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;5. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you&lt;/strong&gt; find your soulmate?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;You find someone willing to pretend you’re their soulmate and you pretend they’re yours and — if you’re lucky — eventually the relationship lives up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p class="inline-ad my-4 border-bottom border-top py-4 text-center" id="div-gpt-ad-inline-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;6. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there such&lt;/strong&gt; a thing as too much lube?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;I used to think there was no such thing as too much maple syrup — I love me some syrup-soaked pancakes — until I read about the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Molasses_Flood"&gt;Great Molasses Flood of 1919&lt;/a&gt;: a storage tank in Boston filled with molasses burst, sending more than two million gallons of molasses pouring through the streets. This giant wave of molasses was moving faster than people could run — 35 miles per hour! — and 21 people drowned and another 150 were injured. So, while sex educators will sometimes say, “There’s no such thing as too much lube,” to correct for the common problem of people using too little, the Great Molasses Flood suggests that there could be such a thing as too much lube. (My editor tells me that maple syrup and molasses aren’t the same thing, which I knew but was pretending not to know for the sake of argument.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;7. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need&lt;/strong&gt; to have a third partner at all times to be considered poly?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;Yes — just like a gay person needs to have gay sex at all times to be considered gay, a bisexual person needs to have MMF or FFM threesomes at all times to be considered bi, a kinky person needs to have someone chained to the wall in their sex dungeon at all times to be considered kinky, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;8. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does one&lt;/strong&gt; even begin having anal sex again after recovering from an anal fissure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;One focuses on anal pleasure, not anal penetration. One lays a vibrator across one’s asshole and one has a few dozen solo orgasms. Then one progresses to small plugs, which are for the pleasure of the person being penetrated. One slowly works one’s way back to dick, while listening to one’s body the whole time. At first one treats the dick like another plug — one gets it in, one gets off, one gets it out. It’s about the penetrated feeling good, not about the penetrator getting off. If it hurts, one stops. If the pain is persistent, one sees a sex-positive gay doctor who specializes in treating anal health issues, like frequent Savage Lovecast guest &lt;a href="https://drevangoldstein.com/"&gt;Dr. Evan Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;9. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was against&lt;/strong&gt; marriage after my divorce — but my potential new marriage comes with an EU passport. Should I do it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;Are you following the news? Run — don’t walk — down that aisle!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;10. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a mostly straight&lt;/strong&gt; cis dude with has a specific kink: I’d love to have my female partner use another man’s cum as lube on my cock during group play. My question is: what level of STI risk does this activity involve? Please rank the risk relative to kissing, oral, PIV, PIA, and other sexual activities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;Rankings, shmankings: If the man whose semen you use as lube has a sexually-transmitted infection — syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, etc. — you and your girlfriend would be at risk of contracting that STI. If the man whose semen you use as lube doesn’t have an STI, you wouldn’t be at risk of contracting an STI. So, the only way to enjoy this kink safely is to find a man who’s willing to get tested and share his test results with you, which would obviously exclude using the semen of some rando you just met at a sex party.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;11. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFAB here. I’ve&lt;/strong&gt; worn out two plug-in Hitachi Magic Wands in the last three years. (RIP. LOL.) Is there a waterproof plug-in vibrator out there that costs less?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;“Cheaper options exist,” said my go-to sex toy expert &lt;a href="https://www.erikamoen.com/"&gt;Erika Moen&lt;/a&gt;, “but your AFAB reader will burn through those cheaper options even faster because when it comes to sex toys, you really do get what you pay for: cheaper toys are of cheaper quality and they wear out much faster. Stick with Magic Wands, which are built to last (mine is 15 years old!) and come &lt;a href="http://magicwandoriginal.com/warranty"&gt;with a warranty&lt;/a&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;You submitted your question via Instagram, so I took a peek at your feed to make sure we were talking about a human pet here, which we are. If your pet isn’t restrained when you peg him, you could encourage your pet to stroke himself during a pegging session. But for some people — and human pets are people — anal penetration is its own reward/pleasure, and they can be soft and loving it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          &lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-native-contribution" class="inline-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;13. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How tight does&lt;/strong&gt; a silicone cock ring need to be in order to help with ED?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;A cock ring needs to be snug enough to restrict the flow of blood out of the penis but not so tight as to completely prevent the flow of blood out of (and into) the penis. Silicone rings are safe to experiment with because, unlike steel rings, you can easily remove one that turns out to be too tight. (Removing a steel cock ring that turns out to be too tight could require a trip to the ER.) So, get a selection of silicone cock rings in different sizes and find the one that feels comfortable and gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;14. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My boyfriend has&lt;/strong&gt; a degradation kink. It doesn’t work for him to be degraded by someone who loves him (me), so he’s asked for permission to get this need met outside our relationship. He says his last boyfriend refused to give him permission and he wound up cheating on him. Being told I either have to agree or get cheated on feels like I don’t actually have a choice. Advice?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;Pick your poison: you can give your boyfriend permission (and live with the awareness that he’s getting this one need met elsewhere) or you can withhold permission (and live with the anxiety that he might cheat on you to get this one need met) or you break up with your boyfriend (and live without him because you couldn’t live with the awareness or the anxiety).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;15.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; I’m a straight&lt;/strong&gt; female dating a straight male who was a sperm donor ten years ago. His donor-conceived children can choose to contact him when they start turning 18 and he could have as many as sixty children! I want to have children myself with him myself but the anxiety of having to discuss this with my children— and having to worry about &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-sperm-donor-limit-accidental-incest-fertility/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;accidental half-sibling incest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — is weighing on me. My partner is not concerned, and it frustrates me that he does not understand why I have so much concern. I honestly think this will be an ongoing issue and that my future children will need therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;If the thought of having children with this particular straight male causes you this much anxiety — if you’re spending all your time worrying about the therapy your future children will need if you have them with this man — there’s a simple fix: have your future children with some other straight male.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;16. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we have&lt;/strong&gt; great and very connected sex for more than an hour but neither of us can come, what does that mean? This has been going on for six years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;If you’re referring to not being able to come during intercourse, it could mean that PIV or PIA doesn’t get either of you there and you should enjoy penetrative sex before pivoting to sexual activities that get you both off. But if you mean you can’t come in each other’s presence at all — if  neither of you can achieve climax during your hour-long sex sessions — you should seek the help of a qualified sex therapist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;17. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does it&lt;/strong&gt; seem like no one is doing anything? No mass protests? Nothing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
          
        
          
          &lt;p&gt;Five million people took part in the No Kings protests across the United States on June 14.

          &lt;p&gt;18. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a 23-year-old&lt;/strong&gt; gay man. I recently hooked up with a 55-year-old man who is married to a woman. I didn’t find out he was married and DL until I was at his place and about to have sex with him. I was too timid to end the interaction, so I went through with the hookup. I ended up blocking him after, but I feel really guilty. Did I do something really awful? And if so, how do I make it better?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="d-inline-block my-3 p-3 bg-light"&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to read the rest?&lt;/strong&gt; Subscribe now to get every question, every week, the complete Savage Love archives, special events, and much more!&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p class="login-cta fs-5 fw-bold"&gt;&lt;a data-bs-target="#subscriptionBenefits" data-bs-toggle="modal" href="https://savage.love/savagelove/2025/09/30/quickies-84/#"&gt;All Subscriber Benefits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt; &lt;hr&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating breakfast within two hours of waking up helps stabilize blood sugar and supports a healthy metabolism.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping a consistent breakfast time is important for maintaining a healthy body.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study suggests that eating breakfast later in the day may be linked to poor health and a shorter life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While having breakfast an hour earlier won’t automatically extend your life, eating at a consistent time is important for maintaining a healthy weight and more stable blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-breakfast-timing-matters"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Breakfast Timing Matters &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study included 2,945 older adults in the United Kingdom. Participants who began eating breakfast later had an increased risk of early death. For every hour breakfast was delayed, mortality risk increased 8% to 11%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Genetics, challenges preparing meals, illness, and sleep issues may have contributed to the shifts in breakfast timing. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings suggest that later breakfast timing may help identify older adults at risk for health problems, but more research is needed to understand the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/timing-of-meals-chrononutrition-7098622" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relationship between breakfast timing and longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Unfortunately, from this publication, we do not know if the later breakfast time is the result or the cause of adverse outcomes in aging,” said &lt;a href="https://scholars.uab.edu/19152-robert-mankowski" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Robert Mankowski, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, Division of Gerontology, Geriatrics, and Palliative Care, who was not involved in the study. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study does not identify a perfect breakfast time. Still, many nutrition experts recommend eating within an hour or two of waking up to break your overnight fast and provide nutrients to fuel the day ahead.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For most people, starting the day with an earlier meal helps set the tone for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-eat-healthy-11682129" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthier eating and better metabolic balance&lt;/a&gt;,” said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/angel-planells" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Angel Planells, MS, RDN, CD&lt;/a&gt;, a Seattle-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Planells added that eating within two hours of waking up helps stabilize blood sugar, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-boost-metabolism-11725404" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;kickstart metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, and align eating with your circadian rhythm. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has shown that having an early breakfast helps improve blood glucose levels and enhances glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) response after eating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This hormone is naturally released after meals to regulate appetite, support digestion, and manage blood glucose levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When thinking about the best time to eat breakfast, maintaining a consistent schedule is key.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The 'best' breakfast time is one that you can stick to consistently throughout the entire week and feel energized and satiated, but eating breakfast closer to when you wake up is generally better," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.uci.edu/faculty/matthew-landry/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Matthew Landry, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of Population Health &amp;amp; Disease Prevention at UC Irvine, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study on the long-term effects of calorie restriction found that consistent breakfast timing was associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/calorie-deficit-vs-intermittent-fasting-8773958" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss and greater calorie restriction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some animal and human research also suggests that eating breakfast consistently supports a healthy circadian rhythm.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A disrupted circadian rhythm can lead to drowsiness, difficulty focusing, diabetes, blood pressure problems, and mood disorders.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "When you eat breakfast at roughly the same time each day, you're essentially telling your internal clock: it's time to wake up and time to get to work. I think that’s why we see the connection to metabolism, hormone levels, blood sugar control, and energy levels," Landry said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-should-you-start-eating-breakfast-earlier"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Should You Start Eating Breakfast Earlier? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the new study's findings, eating breakfast an hour early won't magically add years to your life. But there are many potential benefits to eating within two hours of waking up: better glucose control, a healthy circadian rhythm, and weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "If it is hard to eat right after waking up, give yourself 60-90 minutes before you start eating. That can give your body time to wake up, and it's still within the healthy 2-hour window," &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/ncal/doctor/bethgoodridge" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Beth Goodridge, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian at Kaiser Permanente in Walnut Creek, CA, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's normal not to feel hungry right when you wake up, but don't wait too long to eat. She added that not eating breakfast means you might make up the missed calories later with higher-calorie foods or larger portions.

Researchers found that analyzing subtle facial cues was just as informative as tracking neural activity, suggesting that the mind leaves visible traces on the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similarity of patterns across different mice indicates that these facial “thought signatures” may be stereotyped, much like emotions. While the discovery paves the way for new diagnostic and research tools, it also highlights the urgent need to protect mental privacy in an era of ubiquitous video recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equal to Neurons:&lt;/strong&gt; Facial movements matched brain recordings in decoding strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar facial signatures were found across multiple mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; Results raise questions about protecting mental privacy in humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s easy to read emotions on people’s faces – each one has its clear, unmistakable signature. But what about thoughts? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; shows that mice’s problem-solving strategies can be deciphered from subtle facial movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113108"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince.jpg" alt="This shows a face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/face-thoughts-neurosceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results were striking – the movements of the face were just as informative as populations of neurons. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this is a proof of concept that the contents of the mind can be read out from video recordings, potentially offering powerful new research and diagnostic tools.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To our surprise, we found that we can get as much information about what the mouse was ‘thinking’ as we could from recording the activity of dozens of neurons,” said author Zachary Mainen, a principal investigator at the Champalimaud Foundation in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having such easy access to the hidden contents of the mind could provide an important boost to brain research. However, it also highlights a need to start thinking about regulations to protect our mental privacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do mice think about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, the team had challenged mice with a puzzle in which they had to figure out which of two water spouts provided a sugary reward. Since the availability of the reward switched from one spout to the other, the mice had to develop strategies for deciding which spout to opt for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that mice can solve this task using different strategies, and we could identify which strategy they were using according to their behaviour,” explained Fanny Cazettes, the first author and now a principal investigator at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Aix Marseille University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected that neurons in the mice’s brains would only reflect the strategy they used, but in fact all strategies were present simultaneously, regardless of which the mouse was using at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery presented the team with a unique opportunity to link brain activity and facial movements.  They asked: “Could all strategies simultaneously present in the brain also be detected in the face?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mirror of the mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team recorded the animals’ facial movements along with the activity of neurons in their brains and analysed these data using machine learning algorithms. The results were striking – the movements of the face were just as informative as populations of neurons.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Davide Reato, currently a research associate at Aix Marseille University and Mines Saint-Etienne highlighted that even though these results were remarkably robust, the similarity across mice was even more surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Similar facial patterns represented the same strategies across different mice. This suggests that the reflection of specific patterns of thought at the level of facial movement might be stereotyped, much like emotions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new way of studying the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this study charts a path to studying the brain non-invasively, which could help us better understand brain function in health and disease. However, given the ubiquitous nature of video recordings in our society, they also highlight the need to consider how to protect people’s mental privacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that videos are not just records of behaviour – they can also provide a detailed window into brain activity. Even though this is exciting from a scientific perspective, it also raises questions about the need to safeguard our privacy,” concluded author Alfonso Renart, a principal investigator at the Champalimaud Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759250082130"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Can thoughts be read from facial movements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Yes—researchers showed mice’s problem-solving strategies could be decoded from subtle facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759250098103"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How does reading facial movements compare to brain recordings when reading thoughts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Facial movements were as informative as monitoring dozens of neurons directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759250141416"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why does it matter that facial movements can predict thoughts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It opens the door to non-invasive brain research but also raises concerns about mental privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99f1fcfdf0b7e0f6ecf7fed9f7fcecebf6b7fffaf1f8f4e9f8f5f0f4f8ecfdb7f6ebfe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hedi Young&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neuro.fchampalimaud.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hedi Young – Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02071-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Facial expressions in mice reveal latent cognitive variables and their neural correlates&lt;/a&gt;” by Zachary Mainen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facial expressions in mice reveal latent cognitive variables and their neural correlates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain activity controls adaptive behavior but also drives unintentional incidental movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such movements could potentially be used to read out internal cognitive variables that are also neurally computed. Establishing this would require ruling out that incidental movements reflect cognition merely because they are coupled with task-related responses through the biomechanics of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we addressed this issue in a foraging task for mice, where multiple decision variables are simultaneously encoded even if, at any given time, only one of them is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that characteristic features of the face simultaneously encode not only the currently used decision variables but also independent and unexpressed ones, and we show that these features partially originate from neural activity in the secondary motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that facial movements reflect ongoing computations above and beyond those related to task demands and demonstrate the ability of noninvasive monitoring to expose otherwise latent cognitive states.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 16:48:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9LaHZ3NEtlbVh0SDFZSHJPTnZyN3p1TTdQUGdINnhTeFVEakxfc1NRWmlndjBMVnhsU1ZEYzY3ZEJtT0YydW9uZFZMRXc1Vk9ORlhQM2x0MGR4YTl5UTd6LUk5dGhhb2FFcHRjOQ</guid></item><item><title>纽约中部有电子电气设备的男子死亡；自2015年以来首次在这里发生与电子电气设备相关的死亡- Syracuse.com</title><link>https://www.syracuse.com/health/2025/09/central-ny-man-with-eee-dies-first-eee-related-death-here-since-2015.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4RLEYXO4HBFELIWEVGCH3ZTR6U"&gt;Sullivan, N.Y. - A Madison County man with the rare eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YXULIH5XOBEX5O2HAXKNN5NBAE"&gt;The man is the first human death from the mosquito-borne virus in Central New York since a &lt;a href="https://www.syracuse.com/news/2015/09/salina_man_dies_of_eastern_equine_encephalitis.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Salina man&lt;/a&gt; died in 2015.

But there are so many supplements out there—which ones do you truly need and which ones may actually be effective? We asked our editorial team what supplements they take and why. Here's what they said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-vitamin-d-fish-oil-and-magnesium-glycinate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few supplements I take and swear by—with my doctor's recommendations:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/vitamin-d2-vs-d3-8726305" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is my number one. I take it all year round but less frequently in the summer since I get it naturally. It makes a noticeable difference in my energy levels and mood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/fish-oil-benefits" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fish oil&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I take it for brain and mental health benefits (and my eye doc says it's good for preventing dry eye).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/magnesium-glycinate-8415806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Magnesium glycinate&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This is for when I need help sleeping. It helps me relax and feel drowsy before bed without making me feel groggy in the morning (which melatonin sometimes does). Plus, it's good for muscle relaxation and recovery, so I might take it before bed if I feel sore from a workout.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-womens-multi-vitamin-muscle-recovery-and-stress-management-gummies"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Currently, I take three types of supplement gummies:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women's multi-vitamin:&lt;/strong&gt; I take this because I don't think I get all the nutrients I need from food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Muscle recovery sleep gummies:&lt;/strong&gt; They have melatonin, tart cherry extract, and vitamin D to help with my insomnia and muscle recovery. I'm not sure if it's working well for my muscles, but I do feel like it's helped with my sleep recently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress management gummies:&lt;/strong&gt; I gummies I take have GABA, L-theanine, and lemon balm. I can definitely tell a difference in my mood from taking these. These are awesome for me!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not everyone needs a supplement. The supplements you may need are based on your &lt;strong&gt;individual health needs and wants&lt;/strong&gt;. If you are considering taking a new supplement, discuss it with your doctor first. They can let you know if the supplement is right for you and direct you on how to take it.

The U.S. Food &amp;amp; Drug Administration does not inspect supplements the same way it does medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A supplement company can have its products third-party tested for ingredient safety. Look for a seal from third-party testers, such as NSF International, United States Pharmacopeia (USP), or ConsumerLab, on the supplement package.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s College of Medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzhm4yu005028pa254xddl5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One recent weekend, I didn’t drink much while out in the sun. That Monday morning, after seven hours of sleep, I still felt exhausted. I was irritable, moody and unfocused.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz000s3b6nvd1la8a7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My first instinct was coffee, which only made me jittery. Then I realized I was dehydrated. I drank two bottles of water over the next hour — and felt like myself again. Hydration restored my body’s balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz000t3b6n5wy0labg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We hear so much about daily water requirements, and like you, I aim to drink mine carrying &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/reviews/best-water-bottle?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=mainsite&amp;amp;utm_id=features"&gt;reusable water bottles&lt;/a&gt; in every shape, color and size. What you might not hear as much is that it’s not just water in — it’s water &lt;em&gt;out.&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz000u3b6ntics9y12@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients, even those with no kidney stone issues, always ask me, “How much water should I drink?” It’s one of the most challenging questions to answer because there’s no one-size-fits-all. As a urologist — and as a kidney stone patient in recovery, I stress this advice: The goal isn’t ounces in, it’s urine out. Here’s what else to know about developing a healthy water habit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmfzi13ds001l3b6nuu3pc51m@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="water-matters-to-your-body" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Water matters to your body
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz000v3b6n809m03qn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your body is about &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/water-science-school/science/water-you-water-and-human-body" target="_blank"&gt;60% water&lt;/a&gt;. That fluid lives inside your cells, between them and in the bloodstream. It cushions organs and joints, carries essential nutrients and hormones, clears waste and helps keep your body temperature in check.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz000w3b6n3yz0ikjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Water also works in conjunction with electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium and chloride. They help your muscles contract, your nerves fire and your blood pressure stay balanced. If water intake falls behind losses, electrolyte concentrations can shift. That’s why dehydration can show up as muscle cramps, dizziness or even an irregular heartbeat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz000x3b6nzsq8ljwk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you’re even mildly dehydrated — as I was that weekend — the body has to work harder to maintain balance. Blood becomes more concentrated, the heart must pump harder, and the brain feels the strain — fatigue, fuzzy thinking, slower reaction time. Digestion can also slow down since water helps move food through the gut.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz000y3b6nbo1v6ci8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On the flip side, overhydrating without enough sodium — especially during endurance exercise — can be just as dangerous. It dilutes sodium in the blood, which can lead to confusion, nausea and in extreme cases, seizures. That’s why balance matters: Hydration is not just about water, but water and electrolytes working together.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz00103b6nhdcd9o78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most people immediately freak out when I suggest about eight to 10 glasses of water a day. That’s because they realize they’re nowhere close. And to be honest, unless I’m actively paying attention, I don’t always hit that number either. That’s OK. The truth is, some people need more, and some need less. And it can be harder to do when you’re doing shift work or traveling or facing any other number of reasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz00113b6nq1osudj3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The standard advice is about 3.7 liters or 125 ounces per day for most men and 2.7 liters or 92 ounces per day for most women — from all sources, not just glasses of water, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2004/02/report-sets-dietary-intake-levels-for-water-salt-and-potassium-to-maintain-health-and-reduce-chronic-disease-risk" target="_blank"&gt;National Academy of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the Institute of Medicine.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Roughly 20% of that typically comes from food. Think of these numbers as a starting point, not a hard limit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz00123b6nhb24uxob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Remember it’s also how much urine you produce: &lt;a href="https://www.auanet.org/guidelines-and-quality/guidelines/kidney-stones-medical-mangement-guideline" target="_blank"&gt;Urology guidelines recommend&lt;/a&gt; producing at least 2.5 liters of urine a day to lower stone recurrence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz00133b6nb152bd4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Water needs depend on your body size, activity level, the climate you live in and even the medications you take. A one-size-fits-all number doesn’t exist. That’s why I like the simple “urine color check” more than counting ounces.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz00153b6nc945azfs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now look at your urine. Yes, really. Aim for pale yellow throughout the day. Medium to dark yellow usually means you’re behind. Vitamins and some foods can change the shade, and your first pee of the morning will almost always be darker — that’s normal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz00163b6n1qcbswsf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Some days call for more water: when it’s hot or humid, you’re doing a long workout, you have a fever, you’re nauseous or have diarrhea, you’re doing high-altitude travel or eating a salty meal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz00183b6ni2tq0ksj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the heat, steady sipping is best — about 8 ounces every 15 to 20 minutes. Don’t exceed 48 ounces (1.5 quarts) in an hour, or you risk dangerously low blood sodium. Think of this as a water marathon, not a sprint.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz00193b6nxwv5xyjn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hydration is important for urinary tract infection prevention in both &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/15/health/urinary-tract-infection-men-wellness/index.html"&gt;men&lt;/a&gt; and women. Want proof? In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2705079?utm_source=chatgpt.com#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; of premenopausal women prone to recurrent UTIs, those who increased their water intake by about 1.5 liters daily experienced 1.7 infections over a year, compared with 3.2 in the control group — a nearly 50% reduction. They also required fewer antibiotics (1.9 courses versus 3.6).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001a3b6ngtx878it@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overhydration — especially during endurance activities — can dangerously dilute blood sodium, a condition known as exercise-associated hyponatremia. Marathon runners collapsing at the finish line often drank too much plain water, not too little. If you’re running long distances in the heat, combine water with salt — through sports drinks or salty foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001b3b6nmzb0obdp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have chronic conditions such as kidney disease or heart failure, be extra cautious. Your body might not handle large fluid loads well. In these cases, drinking excessive amounts can overload your system, causing swelling, shortness of breath or dangerous electrolyte imbalances. For these individuals, fluid intake goals should always be tailored with your doctor’s guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001c3b6ngwff94j7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plain water is ideal, but it’s not the only way to meet your hydration needs. Coffee and tea count for regular caffeine consumers. In fact, controlled studies show that moderate coffee hydrates about as well as water. Alcohol does the opposite — drawing fluid out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001d3b6nug29war8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Regarding the many types of water at stores — alkaline, spring, reverse osmosis, “structured” water — most are marketing gimmicks, not medical essentials. Your kidneys don’t care if your water is from a mountain spring or your tap filtered at home. What matters is consistency, not branding. If a particular type encourages you to drink more because you like the taste, that’s fine. But don’t feel pressured to pay extra for gimmicks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001e3b6nazrtyk2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If plain water isn’t your thing, add a squeeze of lemon or fruit slices. A few drops of flavor enhancers — such as squeezable sweeteners found in grocery aisles — can also make water more enjoyable. The best water is the one you will actually drink throughout the day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001f3b6ndllsyzt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For extended, sweaty activities, add electrolytes or salty foods to replace sodium along with water. For everyday life and moderate exercise, water plus a balanced diet is usually sufficient.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001g3b6n6tw659lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s the same thinking with water bottles: The “best” water bottle is the one you’ll use. If a specific style or gadget encourages you to drink more, that’s great. But don’t let marketing convince you that the container matters more than the habit. Keep it simple — just drink.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001h3b6n98zuy5rw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For me, drinking water has to fit into my daily routine. Between surgeries, I grab a glass of water — if I have seven cases, that’s seven built-in breaks to hydrate. In the clinic, I drink less because I’m constantly moving between patients, but I make up for it during lunch and on the drive home. I also consume two to three protein shakes a day. They remind me that fluids come from more than just water bottles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001i3b6nns5r3082@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We often think about water only during emergencies — such as hurricanes or heat waves with empty store shelves. But the real success lies in making hydration a daily habit, not a panic-buying response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001j3b6ntzzval8l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Set a realistic baseline, monitor your urine, adjust as needed, and respect heat and activity-related limits. Simple, consistent habits keep you hydrated — and that’s the plan I follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfzi12xz001k3b6ndxwi9l8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And yes — as I finish writing this, I’m drinking from a water bottle I picked up at the CNN souvenir shop. Proof that sometimes, the best hydration plan is the one you’ll stick with — even if it has a logo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating enough protein throughout the entire day is more important than timing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consuming high-quality protein before and after exercise, about four to six hours apart, may good for muscle growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein timing is a popular strategy thought to optimize workouts by consuming protein immediately before or after exercise, especially within the anabolic window. Athletes sometimes obsess over this "window of opportunity" to facilitate muscle repair and enhance post-exercise strength.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-is-the-anabolic-window"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Is the "Anabolic Window"? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The "anabolic window" is the 30- to 60-minute post-workout period that’s supposed to be the best time to consume protein for &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-hypertrophy-5079597" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle growth&lt;/a&gt; and recovery.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the optimal window—if it exists—can stretch to four to six hours before or after exercise, according to a meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There is not an all-or-none switch that if you don’t get protein in now, nothing happens. That’s definitely not the case.” &lt;a href="https://hhp.ufl.edu/about/faculty-staff/gordon,-benjamin,-ph.d./" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Benjamin Gordon, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an instructional assistant professor of applied physiology and kinesiology at the University of Florida, told Verywell.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Proteins contain amino acids that help repair and build muscles, so there are benefits to eating protein both before and after a workout.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s more important to eat enough protein throughout the day than to time it right.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally, you need 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight on a daily basis to stay healthy. Athletes who want to gain muscle should eat between 1.2g–2g of protein per kilogram of body weight each day, according to a 2016 position statement from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada,and the American College of Sports Medicine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re physically active and want to gain muscle, you should prioritize protein in every meal, according to &lt;a href="https://hses.ku.edu/people/ashley-herda" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ashley A. Herda, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor for the exercise science program at the University of Kansas Edwards Campus in Overland Park.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 2018 study found that consuming high-quality protein before and after exercise, around four to six hours apart, is best for increasing muscle mass. And the “anabolic window” isn’t that narrow—your muscles can stay sensitized to protein for 24 hours after exercising.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein supplements are synonymous with muscle gains in the fitness world, but nutrition experts say it’s better to get protein from food sources first.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s best to consider a protein supplement just that—a supplement to an otherwise varied and nutritious eating pattern. Supplements can be beneficial if a person is having trouble meeting their daily protein needs due to their high activity levels or active growth and development,” &lt;a href="https://www.fcs.uga.edu/people/bio/emma-laing" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Emma Laing, PhD, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor and director of dietetics at the University of Georgia, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein powders are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so it’s not a guarantee that the contents match what is listed on the label, and some products reportedly contain toxins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people can get enough protein from a regular diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/whey-protein-uses-side-effects-and-more-7498855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whey&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/casein-5081318" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;casein&lt;/a&gt; are two protein types that support muscle growth, and they can be found in cow’s milk and some dairy products. Eggs, meat, and beans are also good sources of protein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-you-need-more-than-protein-for-muscle-gain"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; You Need More Than Protein for Muscle Gain &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is essential for building muscle, but one macronutrient alone isn’t enough. It’s also important to consume healthy fats and to stay hydrated, according to Herda.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Water aids in muscle recovery and helps the body maintain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/homeostasis-6755366" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;homeostasis&lt;/a&gt;. If we even get slightly dehydrated, our systems become disrupted, and that will hinder recovery and gains,” Herda said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are also important since your body needs energy for muscle building. In addition to protein, you should consume 2–3g of carbohydrate per pound of body weight daily, according to &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, RDN, LDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian based in Miami.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Strength training is required for building muscle on top of eating protein and carbohydrates, she added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Lifting weights will be more beneficial for building muscle than simply eating more protein, unless you’re not obtaining enough protein through your diet,” Kimberlain said.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A baby in Mississippi has died of whooping cough, the Mississippi State Department of Health announced on Monday, marking the state’s first whooping cough death in 13 years. The infant was less than two months old and was not old enough to receive the pertussis vaccine, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mississippi has seen 115 pertussis cases from Jan. 1, 2025, to Sept. 29. Through all of 2024, the state had only detected 49 whooping cough cases, MSDH reported. Mississippi State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney said that Mississippi’s last whooping cough deaths were in 2008 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do believe that declining vaccination rates are impacting this,” he told reporters on Sept. 29. “Mississippi, as you know, scores very high with our rate of vaccination for our infants and school-aged children, but we don’t score nearly as well with adults. And so, our concern is that adult Mississippians are not maintaining the pertussis immunity, which puts our babies at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory infection with symptoms like extreme, uncontrollable coughing that causes shortness of breath, he said. It usually starts with a runny nose and congestion that manifests into a violent, uncontrollable cough that often sounds like a “whoop,” the state health officer explained. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pertussis could linger anywhere between two to eight weeks in a person if left untreated, Edney said. In adults, pertussis is typically mild, and he said people usually think they have a common cold. People should quarantine for anywhere between six to 21 days if they have pertussis, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That cough can hang around for a very long time, and the longer they have it untreated, the more dangerous,” Edney warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics can treat pertussis and slow the spread of the disease to others, he said. Coughing can be particularly dangerous for infants as it can cause breathing complications, he reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A lot of times, you know, babies don’t cough; they just stop breathing,” the state health officer said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edney said the best way to prevent pertussis is to get vaccinated against it and keep up with booster shots every 10 years through the &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page/41,0,71.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tdap shot&lt;/a&gt;, which is available for those ages 7 and older and also offers protection against tetanus and diphtheria. Since infants cannot get vaccines until they are two months old, the state health officer said it is especially important for older children and adults to get vaccinated to protect the smallest Mississippians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are some vaccines that are fully protective—like the MMR, measles, mumps, rubella—once you’re vaccinated or you have the illness, then you have personal, lifelong immunity,” he said. “Then we have other vaccines that are more temporary, like tetanus, that’s why you have to get a tetanus booster every 10 years—very protective, but if you don’t stay up to day, then your immunity is going to wane.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pregnant women should get the pertussis vaccine or booster, usually offered in conjunction with tetanus and diphtheria as the Tdap shot, between the 27th and 36th week of pregnancy, Edney said. He encouraged families to keep newborns at home and away from many visitors, especially sick people, during the baby’s first six to eight weeks of life. After two months, infants can receive the DTaP shot, which protects against whooping cough for children under 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pertussis falls into the category of vaccines that’s extremely helpful but not fully protective, so we need to keep our immunity rates as best we can to protect the little ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More information on vaccinations and how to get them is available on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page/14,0,71.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mississippi Department of Health’s website&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They ate sugary cereals, frozen dinners, snack cakes, and colorful drinks loaded with artificial flavors and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study says that early exposure may have done more than shape eating habits – it may have led to something more serious: addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-cravings-mimic-drug-dependence"&gt;Food cravings mimic drug dependence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have debated whether food can truly be addictive the way drugs or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/is-marijuana-really-safer-than-alcohol-science-weighs-in/"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; are. This study strengthens the idea that food can be addictive. Ultra-processed foods, designed to hit the brain’s reward system hard and fast, make the case even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at Americans between ages 50 and 80 and found something surprising: 21 percent of women and 10 percent of men aged 50 to 64 met the clinical criteria for addiction to ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot higher than what was found in older adults. Among people aged 65 to 80, only 12 percent of women and 4 percent of men showed signs of food addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers came from a national survey conducted by the &lt;a href="https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Michigan’s National Poll on Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers used a tool called the Modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey explored cravings, withdrawal, failed attempts to cut back, and avoiding social events to keep eating certain foods. Basically, the team applied the same standards used to diagnose addiction to drugs or alcohol – but here, the “substance” is processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-raised-on-tv-dinners"&gt;Raised on TV dinners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generation born in the late 1960s through the early 1970s hit their teens and twenties just as ultra-processed foods exploded in popularity. Fast food chains multiplied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grocery stores filled with low-fat cookies and frozen meals marketed as healthy. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/controversial-soda-additive-has-been-banned-by-the-fda/"&gt;Soda&lt;/a&gt;, candy, and chips became everyday staples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say this matters. “Today’s older adults were in a key developmental period when our nation’s food environment changed,” said Lucy Loch, a graduate student in the University of Michigan Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With other research showing clear links between consumption of these foods and risk of chronic disease and premature death, it’s important to study addiction to ultra-processed foods in this age group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diet-foods-backfire"&gt;Diet foods backfire&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that women in their 50s and early 60s are more likely than men to meet the criteria for food addiction. This goes against the trend seen with other addictions like alcohol or nicotine, which tend to affect more men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible reason? The marketing of diet foods. In the 1980s and 1990s, companies heavily pushed “light” and “&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-or-low-fat-food-quality-is-more-important-for-heart-health/"&gt;low-fat&lt;/a&gt;” products aimed at women – things like low-calorie frozen dinners, 100-calorie snack packs, and fat-free desserts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food companies still processed these products heavily and packed them with carbohydrates and artificial ingredients. They marketed them as better options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The percentages we see in these data far outpace the percentages of older adults with problematic use of other addictive substances, such as alcohol and tobacco,” said Ashley Gearhardt, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan and the senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also see a clear association with health and social isolation, with much higher risks of ultra-processed food addiction in those who call their mental or physical health status fair or poor, or say they sometimes or often feel isolated from others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-self-image-drives-food-addiction"&gt;Self-image drives food addiction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data shows strong connections between food addiction and how people see their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-two-key-habits-for-losing-weight-without-dieting-meal-timing/"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt;, mental health, physical health, and social lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women between 50 and 80 who described themselves as higher weight were more than 11 times as likely to meet the criteria for ultra-processed food addiction compared to women who said their weight was about right. For men, that number jumped to 19 times as likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all age groups in the study, 33 percent of women who considered themselves of higher weight showed signs of food addiction. Thirteen percent of women who said they were slightly heavier and 17 percent of men who said they were of higher weight also showed signs of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-health-raises-risk"&gt;Poor health raises risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental and physical health also played a role. Men in fair or poor mental health were four times more likely to develop an addiction to ultra-processed foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women in the same category were nearly three times as likely. When it came to physical health, men were three times as likely and women were nearly two times as likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/loneliness-impairs-memory-in-older-adults/"&gt;socially isolated&lt;/a&gt; made a big difference too. Those who said they felt isolated at least some of the time were more than three times as likely to meet the criteria for food addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that people who see themselves as higher weight especially opt for processed foods marketed as healthy – low-fat, low-calorie, high-protein – but still formulated to encourage overconsumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These products are sold as health foods – which can be especially problematic for those trying to reduce the number of calories they consume,” said Gearhardt. “This especially affects women, because of the societal pressure around weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ultra-processed-food-addiction"&gt;Ultra-processed food addiction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings raise urgent questions about whether there are critical developmental windows when exposure to ultra-processed foods is especially risky for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/zapping-the-brain-with-ultrasound-waves-may-cure-drug-addiction/"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt; vulnerability,” said Gearhardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger people today eat even more ultra-processed food than Gen X did. If that trend continues, the future could hold even higher rates of food addiction in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just as with other substances, intervening early may be essential to reducing long-term addiction risk across the life span,” said Gearhardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn’t just shine a light on a generation – it raises concerns about the long-term effects of a food system built for speed, profit, and shelf life. As researchers keep digging into how our brains respond to processed foods, one thing is clear: the line between habit and addiction may be thinner than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.70186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 16:21:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOYnFZaVlWaS1ESHE2bkVwM2FUanFHZ0dRYUdQVjlPS2JlLW9OTG5nNFpaelVNai1BeDZheVhNejB0MlROVTRzeERvV3FUeG1nRnlSbHhOaHRZZmc2empZRXdXSWZueUFyWHZIa29SMk5MMFFLcXJnNXgyUFRRWkRia0l1MXNaT0J0TjRPUHhOMWo3NHBy</guid></item><item><title>研究人员对电动滑板车受伤成本飙升发出警报- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/researchers-sound-the-alarm-on-soaring-e-scooter-injury-costs-2000665263</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2019, I moved to Paris for a study abroad experience and discovered Lime e-scooters. The world’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856423000228"&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; shared scooter system had been around for a little over a year and likely inspired the surge in micromobility solutions—shared and private—that we see today. I loved using them to zoom around the French capital. My host family, less so. And given how much money e-scooter injuries are costing an Irish hospital that isn’t even in a city, their instincts may have been right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Monday, researchers at the European Emergency Medicine Congress revealed that e-scooter injuries cost Irish hospitals an average of $2,024 USD (€1,726) per patient. For one hospital in particular, the total overall cost in one year added up to $150,867 USD (€128,650). While for American standards that might not seem like an exorbitant amount of money, the point is that more people are getting hurt and showing up at hospitals with complex injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Orthopedic burdens&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In 2021 we published the number of patients who came to the emergency department of our suburban hospital as a result of e-scooter injuries, and recently we published an update that showed these figures had more than tripled in 2023. Today I am presenting the results of the follow-on project to delineate the financial costs of them,” Thomas Suttie, a senior house officer in emergency medicine at Dublin’s Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, told the congess, as reported by a European Society for Emergency Medicine &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-staggering-scooter-injuries-quantified-hospitals.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In 2023, 76 patients with e-scooter injuries arrived at the hospital, mainly with musculoskeletal injuries, which frequently featured complex trauma that needed major surgery. Suttie and his colleagues collected information on the cost of their ER visits, acute care ward admissions, radiology services, surgery, and outpatient visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These often placed a burden on our orthopedic colleagues, as these patients required orthopedic follow-up with or without surgery or hospital admission. Thirteen patients required orthopedic admission and 34 patients, including those who were admitted, required outpatient follow-up,” Suttie explained. “The other type of injury was usually head injuries, which did not require medical intervention. There were no deaths among the patients with head injuries, nor were they admitted to the intensive care unit.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, Suttie told Gizmodo that while the 2023 group used for this financial analysis didn’t include any severe head injuries requiring intensive care, these types of cases are becoming more common. He noted that helmet use among e-scooter riders remains limited—only about 8% of patients in a related study were wearing protective headgear—and that many of the head injuries in the cost analysis were concussions that could be treated and discharged directly from the emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Mounting costs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That year, Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown spent $150,867 USD (€128,650) on e-scooter injuries. In addition to the average cost of $2,024 (€1,726) per patient, the total cost of emergency department visits was $41,356 (€35,264), the total cost for outpatients was $20,382 (€17,380), and the total cost of hospital admission was $88,660 (€75,600). According to the researchers, these results can be extrapolated to other Irish hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, as “our hospital is a suburban one, it is not where the majority of e-scooter riding and injuries occur in Dublin. Dublin’s city center hospitals would see more and the cost of them is likely to be significantly higher than in our hospital,” Suttie said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smarter public health policies and updated legislation—such as mandatory helmet laws and stricter enforcement of e-scooter regulations—could significantly reduce injuries, lower costs for riders, and ease the burden on healthcare systems, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because Ireland’s public hospitals absorb medical costs directly, these injuries are further burdening an already overstretched healthcare system. Hospitals in the U.S., however, bill patients or insurance companies directly, meaning the nation’s &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/e-scooter-and-e-bike-crashes-are-skyrocketing-in-the-us-2000478564"&gt;rapid increase in e-scooter and e-bike injuries&lt;/a&gt; is probably leading to significant out-of-pocket costs for patients and higher premiums for insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In fact, according to a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/clinorthop/abstract/2025/02000/electric_scooter_related_injuries_are_becoming.26.aspx"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year on e-scooter injuries in Denver, Colorado, the highest hospital charges for these types of injuries reached nearly $23,000. Even the lower end of the spectrum was exorbitant, with a median cost of $4,871 for e-scooter injuries that occurred during the day.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 16:20:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNcWFmZkl1YlpGWWY3LVlOLUF0Mk5IRkJST2lLbDRSd3IxVVFkdEJKSEZCSkhySVhna3otWFRUOVdUOXFEMUwzU0I4TVZ0dXV3OVJBTVNlVjZ6bUo5MUljR0NueXVQVDRPZ0d5MGhjQ2NxTDRXUjN0cGVLOW1kd3c2OU9IV19aT0E5YWt0WnAxYTNVZnE3VjZZ</guid></item><item><title>新研究显示， 99%的心脏病发作和中风都有可以及早发现的警告信号- Scripps News</title><link>https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/new-study-reveals-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-have-warning-signs-that-can-be-detected-early</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study shows that heart attacks, strokes and heart disease are almost always preceded by warning signs, offering hope that these life-threatening events can be prevented through early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published on Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Researchers analyzed thousands of cases of cardiovascular disease in South Korea and in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They determined whether patients had common risk factors, including blood pressure levels, blood sugar, cholesterol and smoking habits. The findings revealed that in more than 99% of heart disease cases, patients had at least one identifiable risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets this research apart is that the study looked at patients' medical data to note an individual's risk factors rather than just examining patients who were already identified as having high blood pressure or high blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores the importance of preventive care and lifestyle modifications in reducing cardiovascular risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say this data reinforces that patients can take proactive steps to lower their chances of developing heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 2021 to 2024, 41 rodents tested positive for plague in the Tahoe Basin area within El Dorado County, and an additional four tested positive in 2025, totaling 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of the outbreak, one visitor who was camping in the area this summer contracted the plague but they recovered after receiving medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a piece for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sfgate.com/renotahoe/article/lake-tahoe-mice-rat-outbreak-unprecedented-21041674.php"&gt;SF Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Brooks revealed he visited a few hardware stores around Lake Tahoe, with workers describing the same trend - booming sales for rodent traps and poison, leading to a run on supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One staff member told him: 'We get cleared out by the end of the day. Everyone in town is going through the same thing right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And at North Shore Ace Hardware in Kings Beach, assistant manager Maurice Jacques revealed locals haven't seen anything like it in 15 to 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'We're been upping our orders on mouse traps, really anything to do with mice or rats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We get trucks two times a week. By Saturday, we're all out. Some people come in and buy 15 traps at a time.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sergio Arias, of Tahoe Pest Management, said that the rodent problem started surfacing in March, and by the summer months it was surging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told SF Gate: 'This year has been out of this world crazy busy for these rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's highly unusual. I have other buddies in the industry. They say, "I can't keep up."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said he now gets up to 60 calls a week and visits anywhere from eight to 15 homes per day to eradicate the rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, he might have handled around 20 incidents a month.  In one recent call-out, he said he pulled 70 rats out of one house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'That's not even the worst I've seen. The worst was a vacant home. I think we pulled something like 150 rats out of this home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're chewing through siding. They're chewing through the wood on people's homes to get into the walls.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person from Lake Tahoe tested positive for the Black Death in August&lt;span&gt; after being bitten by an infected flea while camping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;California health officials said at the time the person was under the care of a medical professional and was recovering at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It marked El Dorado's first confirmed case of the plague since 2020, which was also believed to have been transmitted in the South Lake Tahoe Area. Prior to that, the disease had not been detected in California since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC map shows confirmed plague cases in the US from 1970 to 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most recent US case prior to that was in July&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14898079/US-state-rocked-sudden-death-medieval-disease-officials-warn-come.html"&gt;, in Colorado&lt;/a&gt;. That patient did not survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the same month, the plague was also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14898079/US-state-rocked-sudden-death-medieval-disease-officials-warn-come.html"&gt;detected in Arizona &lt;/a&gt;when an unidentified resident became the state's first death from the disease since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The resident's cause of death was pneumonic plague, the most dangerous form of the Black Death, which spreads by inhaling droplets of saliva emitted from an infected person or animal coughing or sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorado and New Mexico also recorded plague cases last year. The New Mexico patient was the first to be infected with and die of the plague since 2020. Colorado's was the state's first death since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just seven cases of the plague are reported on average in the US each year, according to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-6d2bb000-7dce-11f0-a524-137e79053e67" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a significant reduction when in medieval times the plague, sometimes referred to as the Black Death, wiped out 25 to 50million people in Europe. This was thought to be 30 to 50 percent of the population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plague cases in the US today are rare, with fewer than ten every year. They mostly occur in the Four Corners region (New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Utah), where rodents and fleas thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Untreated plague has a mortality rate of 30 to 60 percent in the US. But if it spreads to the lungs or bloodstream, it's nearly 100 percent deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plague symptoms strike within one to eight days, with fever, chills, and debilitating fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's often accompanied by painful swollen lymph nodes in the groin or armpits. Left untreated, it can enter the bloodstream and travel to the lungs, causing deadly infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is carried by fleas and transmitted between animals. The picture above is a 3D illustration of the bacterium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above CDC graph shows both fatal and non-fatal US plague cases from 2000 to 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the disease enters cells, it kills them by releasing deadly toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infection can arise from handling infected cats, rodents, or their fleas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the California Department of Health, there were 45 ground squirrels or chipmunks with evidence of exposure to the plague bacterium in the Lake Tahoe Basin from 2021 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Modern antibiotics and hygiene have drastically reduced deaths, but the disease remains endemic in wildlife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials urge caution in high-risk areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recommend wearing long pants tucked into boots and using a bug repellent with DEET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people in the area should never feed or touch wild rodents and refrain from camping new animal burrows or dead rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 16:01:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>SAPD要求司机在调查期间避开Huebner路附近的I-10西行- KSAT</title><link>https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2025/09/30/sapd-asks-drivers-to-avoid-i-10-westbound-near-huebner-road-amid-investigation/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAN ANTONIO&lt;/strong&gt; – A live pipe bomb was found at an apartment complex Tuesday morning along Interstate 10 on the Northwest Side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;San Antonio police Sgt.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6ow279000h3b7afpk8tywt@published"&gt;My 12-year-old son has not seen his father since we divorced and he moved about seven hours north, 11 years ago. Backstory: Both paternal grandparents and all three of his father’s siblings were drug addicts. When I found out that his father was also using drugs, after we had moved across the country to leave behind that toxic situation, I filed for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6ow06m000c3b7az9mxajj6@published"&gt;When my son was younger, I always explained his father’s absence by saying, “Your dad loved you so much but knew he wasn’t able to be a parent. He knew that Mommy loved you and would be able to take care of you always.” This felt like an adequate explanation for a small child, and since he rarely asked questions about his father, I never really went any deeper with it. Now that we are nearing the teen years, I feel like I should give him a more fleshed-out history. I also worry about the genetic predisposition to addiction; from a clinical perspective, this information is necessary for the choices he will be faced with making in the upcoming years.&lt;br&gt;Should I bring up this history in our conversations about why his father, or anyone else from his father’s family, is not in his life? I’m worried that telling him will make him feel like he is genetically cursed, potentially making drugs more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6ow7ap000m3b7aq9w7pj8d@published"&gt;But I also worry that not saying it will make it seem like it was a shameful secret we tried to bury. He has a dad who’s been in his life since he was 2, a little brother who adores him. Maybe he just isn’t interested in knowing about a family he never knew.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6owguc00113b7aoy799oyz@published"&gt;You can tell your son the truth. There is nothing inherently shameful about the fact that his father was an addict. Addiction destroys families because it is a personal, physical, and some may even say spiritual sickness that makes its sufferers sacrifice everything they would want to hold dear, including those they love. Addiction is terrible. But it is no more shameful than cancer, and it does not need to be a secret.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6owiza00163b7ae2x3gt72@published"&gt;So if and when your son asks, you can be honest. You can say, “Your father had the disease of addiction, and it made it very difficult for him to show up for you and love you as you deserved to be loved. I’m sure he would have liked to have done better, but he could not. And the good news is that I am able to be here and love you and your dad is able to be here and love you, and we always will.”&lt;/p&gt;

But the unfortunate truth is that the science on this is &lt;a href="http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/addiction/genes/"&gt;equivocal&lt;/a&gt; at best. And there is nothing you can say or not say to your son that will guarantee he won’t try drugs, or even become addicted. Obviously this doesn’t stop us from trying. We tell our children that drugs can have a way of ruining lives for some people, many people, and that no one whose life was destroyed ever thought it was going to happen to them. Addiction is cunning, baffling, and powerful. And we hope these words have an impact. And they may. But there is no way to guarantee it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6owmgy001g3b7a2knix7mf@published"&gt;As parents we cannot live too far in the future no matter how much we would like to. Right now, today, you have a safe and happy child who is loved and supported. That’s all you need for today. You can be assured that he is off to a much better start and in better hands than his father was.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p09jq00203b7af0g7a6m6@published"&gt;I have been divorced from my son’s father since my son was 1. We have shared custody in which my son spends every other weekend, parts of the summers, and school vacations with his father. I have always encouraged his father to spend as much time with him as possible, and there have been very few issues regarding custody.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p0bnz00253b7a39lhv3tj@published"&gt;My son is now 12 and in seventh grade. In our town, he has a choice between two high schools: one that is traditional, and the other is specialized and will teach him a trade. I was curious which school he might like to attend, and he brought up that he’d had this conversation with his father already. Apparently his father and stepmom (who is a foreigner) are encouraging my son to go to a high school in their town and live with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p2atv000u3b7av1yfhy9s@published"&gt;This angers me for two reasons. One, his father should have spoken to me about this before bringing it up to our son. I don’t want to get his hopes up only for plans to fall through. Two, my son has lived with me and my husband his whole life. We have raised him to be a competent, respectful, and helpful young man. But like any 12-year-old, he has his faults. I don’t feel like his overly lenient father can provide him the parenting a teenager will require.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel like they are trying to take my son from me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p1e4y00083b7ank6u1k9a@published"&gt;You say that your son has a choice of two high schools to attend, but the reality is that he has a choice of three: the two in your town and the one in his father’s town. That’s right. He has a choice about where he wants to go to school and also where he wants to live. It’s entirely understandable not to like that. But in this case, not liking something doesn’t make it wrong or unfair.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="147" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p1e7a00093b7ain1a817v@published"&gt;Your use of the phrase “trying to take my son from me” implies that he somehow belongs more to you than he does to his father. And I wonder if and why you feel that way. Nothing in your letter explains why his dad should have less of a right to him than you do. Your kid has two parents. You are one of them. (Surely this can’t be related to your bizarrely xenophobic comment that your husband’s partner is a “foreigner.” You know that “foreigners” also successfully have and raise kids, don’t you?) Your son’s dad has every right to suggest that your son come and live with him in high school. And while I agree that it would have been much kinder of him to bring this up to you before he brought it up to your son, the cat’s out of the bag now.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p20ci000k3b7aiowvh6kc@published"&gt;Your son is in seventh grade, and he doesn’t have to make this decision for a year. Even though the topic was introduced in a less-than-ideal way, it is good that it’s out in the open. This is a big decision and would require serious transition. Having it introduced now gives everyone a chance to sit with it for a while. Your son may be leaning toward it now, but against it later. You may be leaning against it now, but come around later. Either way, your ex did you all a favor by jumping the gun.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="207" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmg6p1su3000e3b7aeb2g9vs5@published"&gt;But the one thing I would remind you is that your son’s wishes in this matter should be considered very important, perhaps the most important of anyone’s. You don’t like his father’s parenting style, but there’s no indication that it’s a bad or dangerous one. Just not what you prefer. I’m sure he has some opinions about your choices as well. (As you know, that’s the wonderful world of co-parenting with an ex.) The point here is that your son spends significant time in his father’s household. He comes back happy and in one piece, and is so comfortable there that he’s considering moving there for high school. What is being suggested here is a change in the custody agreement; in most states, courts will take both households into account as well as your son’s preferences as they decide whether or not to grant it. That is, if you want to take it to court. I would remind you that it’s not necessary to do that yet, and probably better not to do it at all. No kid deserves to see their parents fighting one another in court. It’s clear you care deeply for your son, so you should try with all your might to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;

But don’t make your son organize his life around it. There may be very good reasons he wants to spend more time with his father. Let him do what he wants to do with this situation and let him know that you will love and support him always. I wish you good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

But if I ask my brother’s fiancée to be one of my bridesmaids, I’m worried that my parents may refuse to pay. My parents and brother are estranged, and have had very limited contact for several years. Their relationship is tumultuous, and I’ve done my best to stay out of it, but frequently I do something that makes my parents think I’ve formed some sort of alliance with my brother. These “infractions” have included attending their daughter’s birthday party, taking photos with her and posting them on Facebook, and going out to dinner with them. This has caused me to also have a somewhat strained relationship with my parents for the past year or so.&lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/06/dear-prudence-wedding-problems-for-wedding-season-who-pays-who-goes-and-who-goes-too-far.html"&gt; I want my brother’s fiancée to be a bridesmaid and their daughter to be a flower girl, but that also has the potential to cause a big problem. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once a cancer develops in the body, it still takes time for it to come to the attention of the patient and the healthcare system.

Once a cancer develops in the body, it still takes time for it to come to the attention of the patient and the healthcare system.

&lt;p&gt;FENNVILLE, Mich. (WOOD) — A person at Fennville High School was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis, officials say. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No information about the patient’s identity has been released, with officials citing the person’s privacy, but the Fennville Public Schools superintendent said the person has been treated and is expected to be OK. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a Tuesday release, the district and the Allegan County Health Department said they have implemented a “comprehensive and coordinated response plan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Our top priority is the health and well-being of our students and staff,” Superintendent Albert Lombard said in a statement. “We appreciate the rapid, seamless coordination with the Allegan County Health Department. We are following all expert protocols to ensure this situation is managed quickly, discreetly, and effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The district and health department said they were working to identify anyone who may have spent an extended period of time in an enclosed space with the patient and will reach out individually to anyone who may have been exposed with instructions for testing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are working closing with Fennville Public Schools to ensure that that active and inactive TB cases have access to safe and effective testing and treatment. Although tuberculosis can be a serious condition, it is treatable. Completing treatment is one of the best ways to protect yourself, your family and friends, and your community,” Dr. Richard Tooker, the health department’s medical director, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/keep-mi-healthy/communicablediseases/diseasesandimmunization/tb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a bacterial disease that is often spread when people speak, cough or sing. It does not spread as easily as the cold or the flu, but can be spread among people who are in closed spaces or around each other for an extended period of time. The illness cannot be spread by someone who has inactive TB. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Active TB is diagnosed when a person has a positive test and signs or symptoms, such as an abnormal chest X-ray, night sweats, a cough or weight loss. Officials advised anyone with symptoms to contact their doctor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The district and ACHD stress that while active TB is a serious, contagious condition, it is treatable, and outbreaks are uncommon in U.S. school settings,” the Tuesday release said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year, 165 people in Michigan were diagnosed with TB, according to the Michigan Department of Health. In January, a student at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.woodtv.com/news/kalamazoo-county/1-diagnosed-with-active-tb-found-at-kalamazoo-central-hs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kalamazoo High School was diagnosed with TB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

What started as a treatment for seizures and nerve pain has expanded far beyond its original purpose. According to recent CDC data, prescriptions nearly doubled between 2010 and 2016, and although the pace has slowed since then, gabapentin use is still climbing. By 2024, more than 15 million people were receiving it, making it the fifth most dispensed drug in retail pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/blood-type-a-linked-to-higher-stroke-risk-find-out-where-your-blood-group-stands/articleshow/124227869.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Blood type A linked to higher stroke risk: Find out where your blood group stands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/can-geomagnetic-storms-affect-your-blood-pressure/articleshow/124226871.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Can geomagnetic storms affect your blood pressure?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/what-does-magnesium-deficiency-look-like-in-women-know-common-symptoms/photostory/124241743.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;What does magnesium deficiency look like in women? Know common symptoms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the rise comes from doctors using gabapentin “off-label.” That means it’s being prescribed for conditions not officially approved by the FDA, such as certain types of chronic pain. For many patients, it can offer relief when other treatments fail. But the increasing popularity also raises concerns. While gabapentin is often seen as safer than opioids, it carries its own risks—some of which aren’t widely known. From side effects that affect daily functioning to more serious dangers like breathing problems when combined with other drugs, the medication demands careful attention. Patients may not always realize these risks, and many don’t know what symptoms to watch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Gabapentin and why is it prescribed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant drug approved by the FDA to treat seizures, nerve pain after shingles, and restless legs syndrome. It’s sold under the brand name Neurontin and also as a lower-cost generic. The drug comes in capsules, tablets, and liquid form, while an extended-release version is approved only for restless legs syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors often prescribe gabapentin off-label when they believe it may help with conditions beyond its approved uses. This has contributed to its widespread availability and popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people taking gabapentin experience drowsiness, dizziness, or blurred vision. These effects may seem mild but can interfere with driving, working, or daily concentration. Some patients also report nausea, digestive problems, or swelling in the hands and feet. Others notice weight gain, headaches, or flu-like symptoms that are hard to connect to the medication at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rare but serious reactions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, gabapentin can trigger severe allergic responses, including swelling of the face or throat, rashes, or yellowing of the skin. Some people may develop difficulty speaking or swallowing. Others notice sudden changes in memory, concentration, or even personality. These warning signs should never be ignored, as they may signal dangerous complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Breathing problems and abuse potential&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Because gabapentin can increase the effects of opioids, it has also been linked to misuse and, in some cases, overdose deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mental health concerns&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another overlooked risk is its possible impact on mood. Rare cases have connected gabapentin use to suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Patients and families are urged to watch for unusual changes, such as aggression, depression, or talk of self-harm, and report them immediately to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopping gabapentin suddenly can trigger seizures, even in people who were not taking it for epilepsy. That’s why doctors recommend tapering the dose gradually rather than quitting cold turkey. If you need to stop taking it, your physician will guide you through a safe plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Indiatimes</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 14:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>只有拥有非凡记忆力的人才会记得10个童年细节- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-t-10-childhood-details-only-people-with-exceptional-memory-still-remember/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Crafting this list took me back to the small, ordinary moments that most of us let blur together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people don’t—they keep snapshots so crisp it’s like their mind never hit “compress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wondered whether your memory is unusually sharp, look for these specific childhood details that tend to stick only for the outliers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) The map of your first home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exceptional memory often shows up as a mental floor plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just “the kitchen was near the door,” but where the loose tile lived, how the afternoon light slid across the carpet, the exact drawer with the birthday candles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t grand scenes—they’re spatial and sensory anchors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can still “walk” room to room and point to the squeaky board without moving your feet, that’s your &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/j-bt-people-who-stay-mentally-sharp-into-their-80s-all-avoid-these-10-brain-draining-habits/"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; flexing like it never left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) The soundtrack of ordinary days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the hum of the refrigerator at night, the pitch of the school bell, the click-clack pattern of your teacher’s shoes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-baby-scientist/202412/how-to-make-your-memories-stick" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stickier memory&lt;/a&gt; keep audio files of their childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can still hear the off-beat jingle from a local radio station my dad played on Saturday drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those small loops become time machines because sound bypasses the gatekeeper and goes straight to feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) The exact words adults used&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because I said so” is generic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-10-tiny-childhood-details-only-people-with-exceptional-memory-can-still-recall-and-picture-perfectly/"&gt;Exceptional memory&lt;/a&gt; stores the line and the cadence: “Young man, we will return to this conversation once you’ve cooled your head.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You remember who said it, where they stood, and how the room smelled like lemon cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about drama; it’s about verbatim snippets—dialogue captured with punctuation—because emotionally charged or patterned language gets tagged as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) The routes that got you there&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some kids knew every turn to school, not because they navigated, but because their brain recorded the route like a favorite level in a game—left at the mural with the peeling dolphin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Count three speed bumps, wave at the lady with the red watering can, right after the corner store with the flickering “O” in “Open.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could still bike that route today without a map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the path is coded with landmarks, it sticks—and your &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240215-do-some-people-have-a-better-sense-of-direction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sense of direction&lt;/a&gt; becomes a file you never delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) The textures your hands knew&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/texture-clay-lifestyle-child-play.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory isn’t only pictures—it’s touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prickly plastic on the cafeteria chairs, the waxy drag of new crayons, the velcro rasp of sneakers getting ripped open during gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember the ridges on the volume knob of our old stereo because I used to turn it down fast when a song got too loud (ironic, since I grew up blogging about music later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can still feel those &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/dna-psychologists-say-these-6-things-reveal-more-about-a-person-than-their-words/"&gt;micro-textures&lt;/a&gt;, your brain kept the haptic layer of your past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) The micro-timelines nobody else tracked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned this before but our brains love timelines—especially when they’re personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with especially sticky memory know whether the field trip happened before or after Aunt Maya’s visit, what month the neighbor’s dog had puppies, and that the first time they stayed up past midnight was the same week the kitchen got repainted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren’t “facts” you studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re linked events, stitched by context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your childhood plots like a calendar instead of a fog, your &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-episodic-memory-2795173" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;episodic memory&lt;/a&gt; is unusually organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) The smells that called the shots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smell has a VIP pass to memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can conjure the specific scent of the library—the papery dust with a hint of tape and sun—or the way rain on hot asphalt meant soccer practice might be canceled, you’re in rare territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the darkroom at a community center photo class had a sweet-chemical smell that means “quiet focus” to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/smells-and-memory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scent equals instruction&lt;/a&gt;—“this smell means this thing happens”—the brain keeps it on speed dial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) The “rule book” of your household&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every family runs on unwritten rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exceptional rememberers can recite them like a manual: You never answered the landline during dinner, you always left your shoes sideways on the mat, and you called Grandma first on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the exceptions are filed—that one time you ate in the living room because the power went out and dinner was candlelit on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your childhood still reads like a &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/d-t-if-you-grew-up-in-the-1960s-you-probably-remember-these-8-strict-house-rules/"&gt;set of procedures&lt;/a&gt;, your memory stored not just moments but systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9) The small artifacts that had big meaning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all remember a favorite toy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer of us recall the scratch on the sticker, the missing green marble from a board game, or the hairline crack in the blue cereal bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a notebook with a bent corner that made a triangle shadow across every page; I can picture that triangle more clearly than some high school classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tiny artifacts are saved in HD, it signals &lt;a href="https://careers.usc.edu/blog/2024/08/19/12-simple-ways-to-be-more-detail-oriented-and-how-it-will-change-your-life-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;attention to detail&lt;/a&gt; and an emotional tag that said, “Keep this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10) The weather on ordinary days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the first snow or the big storm—everyone remembers those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean the Tuesday that was damp and gray, the weird warm wind at recess in October, the sunbeam that hit your desk at 10:10 a.m. every morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I still recall the exact feel of air in the garage where I practiced chords—cooler by five steps, like walking into a song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you carry the &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/travel/m-7-hot-weather-travel-items-i-could-not-have-done-without-on-my-one-month-trip-to-thailand/"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt; of regular days, your memory didn’t wait for milestones; it archived the ambience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do these details stick for some people and not others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a few patterns show up again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there’s attention. You don’t store what you don’t notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kids who were naturally observant—or who used observation as a way to feel safe, creative, or entertained—built a thicker logbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, there’s emotion. Anything tied to wonder, pride, fear, or comfort gets a highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily intense emotion—just something that mattered to you at the time: a new backpack, a surprising sound, a ritual with a parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there’s repetition. Daily loops solder memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk the same block a hundred times, and your brain builds a 3D model without asking permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those crisp details aren’t there just to impress your friends with your recall as they tell you what you valued early and how you took in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were a “map person,” you might still think best while walking a route; if you were a “soundtrack person,” build playlists to nudge your focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, if you didn’t relate to many of these, that doesn’t mean your memory is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may mean your brain optimized for meaning over minutiae, for people over places, for feelings over furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, when I’m shooting photos or listening to a new indie record, I feel those old circuits glow—the ones that loved patterns, textures, and the ways small things add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the quiet superpower of a detailed memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the small, ordinary moments do what they’ve always done—add up to something unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

Ultrasound can help determine whether that lump is a harmless cyst or a solid mass that warrants closer investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neck and thyroid nodules, swollen lymph nodes and breast lumps are all commonly evaluated with ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other imaging tools, ultrasound avoids radiation exposure and delivers fast results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Thyroid evaluations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thyroid is a small gland that plays a big role in regulating metabolism and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nodules or swelling are fairly common, and many can be detected or monitored using ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients without insurance coverage for extensive diagnostic workups, a self-pay thyroid ultrasound offers a safe, affordable way to check for changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Circulatory health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound can also evaluate blood flow. Carotid artery scans, for instance, help measure the risk of stroke by showing whether fatty deposits are restricting blood flow to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an abdominal aortic aneurysm — a dangerous bulge in the body's largest artery — can be detected before it becomes life-threatening. These scans provide preventive knowledge that can literally save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Liver, kidney and gallbladder function&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound is a frontline tool for evaluating organ health. Liver disease, gallstones and kidney conditions can all be spotted through imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detecting issues early makes treatment more effective and prevents complications down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pregnancy checks and more&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, expecting parents can still benefit from ultrasound technology. Echo Ultrasound offers everything from early pregnancy confirmation and heartbeat checks to detailed anatomy scans and even 3D/4D keepsake imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pregnancy is only part of a much larger story when it comes to what ultrasound can reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Accessible care without the wait&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, ultrasound evaluations often require a doctor's referral, an insurance approval and then weeks of waiting for an imaging appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.echo-ultrasound.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Echo Ultrasound &lt;/a&gt;eliminates those barriers by offering direct scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone can call or book online, pay a flat fee and be seen as quickly as the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That convenience has proven especially valuable for people in between providers, those with high-deductible insurance plans or families who want quick answers without navigating red tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every scan is read by a board-certified radiologist, with results provided within 24–48 business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Affordable, transparent pricing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, the cost of medical imaging is a deterrent to getting the preventative care they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echo's flat-rate model ensures patients know exactly what they'll pay before they walk in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No surprise bills, no confusing codes and no hidden facility fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That transparency gives patients peace of mind and makes preventive screenings more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should consider an ultrasound?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pregnant women are the most obvious candidates, ultrasound has broad applications for anyone who:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiences unexplained abdominal, or pelvic pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Notices a lump or swelling in the neck, extremities or underarm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wants peace of mind with preventive screenings (carotid arteries, abdominal aorta, thyroid, liver, kidneys.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is uninsured or underinsured and seeks a cost-effective diagnostic option.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prefers same-day or next-day access to imaging without referral delays.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound is also useful for patients of all ages, older adults who want to monitor circulatory health and even for young adults experiencing unexplained symptoms that warrant closer examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health conditions often develop quietly before symptoms become severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive imaging offers an opportunity to catch problems while they are still manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it's detecting an aneurysm, monitoring a thyroid nodule or ruling out kidney stones, the earlier an issue is discovered, the better the outcome is likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For communities where access to affordable imaging is limited, Echo Ultrasound fills a crucial gap. The clinic's model brings high-quality diagnostics directly to patients without gatekeeping or long wait times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Peakstock - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound isn't just for expectant parents. It's a powerful, radiation-free diagnostic tool that serves patients of all ages and health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Echo Ultrasound, individuals can schedule themselves, pay a flat fee and receive quick, reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone experiencing pain, swelling or simply seeking peace of mind through preventive screening, ultrasound is a simple step that can provide quick answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And thanks to Echo's affordable, patient-first model, that step is more accessible than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more or schedule an appointment, visit &lt;a href="https://www.echo-ultrasound.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;echo-ultrasound.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2025 14:02:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQN0lHSDNrWXJmOFdsakdRa2hEYWpUbkR1NDhnNTRkWDBxTmpjRDR6WUpVeE4xckc1MUpDcjZDR2lzODhzTFdCeDRCWWFzTTRwR19FRlZfQVgwZnBKZER2VWNrc2ZzbWIxUW80UWFlblRmbW5vWUNGeEpOaEg5TVE1Y2Y5WVJ6MlIzRGx2N1A2Mmg4NzdPeFdmYzdB</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 5种最好的抗炎饮料可以改善血糖- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/best-anti-inflammatory-drinks-better-blood-sugar-11811239</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inflammation and high blood sugar often travel together. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing healthy, low-carb drinks may help manage both of these issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea, golden milk, coffee, dairy milk and 100% veggie juice are all great choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is the wellness buzzword of the moment—and for good reason. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can increase your odds of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669105/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;developing a variety of illnesses&lt;/a&gt; like heart disease, cancer and type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, for people with diabetes, ongoing inflammation can also make &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diabetes-myths-to-stop-believing-11781817" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;managing diabetes difficult&lt;/a&gt;, as inflammation makes it harder for the body’s cells to use insulin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-tea-for-metabolic-syndrome-8782901" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietitians agree that green tea&lt;/a&gt; is a standout beverage on so many levels, including steadier blood sugar and protection from inflammation. For starters, green tea boasts a cocktail of substances that have been linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-tweaks-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-11792895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;better blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, particularly catechins like EGCG.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s not all. Green tea also contains compounds that provide anti-inflammatory benefits in an unexpected way, says &lt;a href="https://www.oswalddigestiveclinic.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcie Vaske, M.S., LN, CNS&lt;/a&gt;. “The polyphenols in green tea feed beneficial gut bacteria, which play a role in blood sugar regulation and inflammation control,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-low-sugar-golden-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Low-Sugar Golden Milk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When it comes to taming inflammation and supporting stable blood sugar, golden milk reigns supreme,” says &lt;a href="http://staceywoodson.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stacey Woodson, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. “This warm, comforting beverage, similar to a chai latte, combines your choice of milk with powerhouse spices.” Included in that potent spice mix is turmeric. This bright, yellow spice is rich in curcumin, a compound with a solid inflammation-fighting track record.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to a 16-study systematic review and meta-analysis, curcumin may also significantly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833638/foods-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower fasting blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and A1C levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As encouraging as this is, golden milk is often sweetened with honey or maple syrup. You may not need to skip these entirely, but it’s a good idea to experiment to find the smallest amount that works for you. Or, whisk in a dash of vanilla extract or sugar-free sweetener for a healthy, low-sugar drink. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you can’t imagine starting your day without a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt;, you aren’t alone. Sure, a cup of joe provides a quick energy boost. It also offers multiple health perks, including help with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291826/7-simple-ways-to-reverse-prediabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;diabetes prevention&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, research has found that coffee drinkers often have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What gives coffee its diabetes-fighting powers? Coffee is rich in an antioxidant called chlorogenic acid, which may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/morning-habits-to-help-prevent-inflammation-11769878" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;improve the body’s ability to use insulin&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like golden milk, coffee can be a vehicle for lots of added sugars, though. Ideally, the best way to enjoy it is black or with a splash of milk. But if you can’t imagine it without some sugar, measure out the minimum you can get away with. Then, slowly scale back from there. Over time, your taste buds will adjust (promise!). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-dairy-milk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Dairy Milk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If someone said there was a drink that packed the highest-quality protein available and was loaded with hard-to-get nutrients, we’d all be running out to buy it. Well, that drink is dairy milk. However, the common misconception that milk is pro-inflammatory has given this nutrient powerhouse a bad name. The truth is, research suggests quite the opposite. Consider the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis that examined the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056066/heres-what-a-dietitian-says-about-dairy-causing-inflammation/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relationship between dairy milk and inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. After culling the results of 28 studies, researchers found that at worst, milk had no impact on inflammation, and in some cases, it may protect against inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This familiar beverage is also a great option for diabetes. Not only does dairy milk provide a long list of underconsumed nutrients, like calcium, potassium and vitamin D, it also is one of the few drinks on this list that contains a hefty dose of protein. Just 1 cup of nonfat milk delivers &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;8 grams of high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, you may have heard that milk contains sugar, and it does. But not to worry. Milk’s protein can help slow the absorption of its sugars. The American Diabetes Association even lists dairy milk as one of its superstar foods for diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-100-vegetable-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. 100% Vegetable Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no denying that vegetables are an excellent choice for blood sugar balance, not to mention your overall health. But when you can’t squeeze in enough veggies at meals, grab a glass of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252667/tomato-vegetable-juice/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;100% vegetable juice&lt;/a&gt;. True, vegetable juice doesn’t provide the fiber that you’d get from whole veggies. But you’ll still score plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;anti-inflammatory nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, one serving of vegetable juice often contains the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17573/what-is-a-serving-of-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;nutrition of several servings of vegetables&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, some types of vegetable juice are higher in carbs than others. Plus, they can also be loaded with sodium. To play it safe, be sure to check the carb, sugar and sodium content on the Nutrition Facts panel and stick to the recommended serving size.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-to-select-a-blood-sugar-friendly-anti-inflammatory-drink"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips to Select a Blood Sugar-Friendly Anti-Inflammatory Drink &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When browsing the beverage options at your store, keep these dietitian-recommended tips in mind to pick the best drink. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit added sugars: &lt;/strong&gt;“Added sugars spike blood sugar levels and can increase inflammation when consumed in larger amounts,” says &lt;a href="https://dietredefined.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Helen Tieu, RD, M.A.N., CDE&lt;/a&gt;. So, be sure to double-check the Nutrition Facts panel for added sugars before tossing a drink into your cart. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be choosy about juice: &lt;/strong&gt;While 100% vegetable juice is a great choice, fruit juice may not work for everyone. While its natural sugars may not be an issue for people with healthy blood sugar levels, the American Diabetes Association recommends that people with diabetes limit fruit juice to ½ cup daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep an eye on serving size:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthy beverages can spell trouble if serving sizes are too large. Even a drink that’s sugar-free may pack lots of calories if it’s oversized. Over time, that can lead to weight gain, making blood sugar management more challenging. So, pour yourself a small glass or cup. And if you’re grabbing a drink on the go, order the smallest option on the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation and blood sugar issues tend to travel together. Whether you’re living with diabetes or simply want to prevent it, choosing the right drinks can help target both of these issues. Green tea, low-sugar golden milk, coffee, dairy milk and 100% vegetable juice are all packed with nutrients that can help tackle inflammation and keep blood sugar in check. Just be sure to opt for the unsweetened or sugar-free varieties and keep serving sizes small. Then go ahead and drink up!&lt;br&gt;

While diabetes has long been seen as the leading danger, researchers discovered that high blood pressure may pose an even greater risk of death, along with low “good” cholesterol. Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients with chronic liver disease (MASLD) who also have high blood pressure, prediabetes or diabetes, or low HDL cholesterol face the greatest risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than one in three people worldwide live with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), making it the most common chronic liver condition across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disease develops when excess fat accumulates in the liver and is linked to one or more of five health issues: obesity, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and low HDL cholesterol, often referred to as the “good” cholesterol. Collectively, these issues are known as cardiometabolic risk factors because they influence both heart health and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, MASLD can progress to severe complications, including advanced disease of the liver, heart and kidneys. However, researchers have only recently begun to investigate whether certain cardiometabolic risk factors increase the likelihood of death more than others in people with this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The deadliest cardiometabolic risk factors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study from Keck Medicine of &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_d8eaebe4b77c21082330234975facd70" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;USC&lt;/span&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/em&gt; reveals that three of the cardiometabolic risk factors carry the greatest risk of death for those with MASLD: high blood pressure, pre-diabetes or Type 2 diabetes, and low HDL, which raise the risk of death by 40%, 25% and 15%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results were independent of how many or which combination of cardiometabolic risk factors patients had, and held steady despite individuals’ gender, sex, race, or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_496619" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-496619" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Norah-A.-Terrault-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-496619" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Norah-A.-Terrault-777x981.jpg" alt="Norah A.

&lt;p&gt;“MASLD is a complicated disease, and this study sheds new light on where doctors may want to focus their efforts when treating patients,” said Norah A. Terrault, MD, a hepatologist with Keck Medicine and a senior author of the study. “Knowing which aspects of MASLD might lead to poorer outcomes can help us offer patients the best possible care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers were especially surprised to discover that high blood pressure was associated with a higher chance of death than diabetes, said Matthew Dukewich, MD, PharmD, MS, a USC transplant hepatology fellow and lead author of the study. “Until now, it was commonly thought that diabetes was the most pressing health problem for MASLD patients, which is a key insight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that obesity, the most common cardiometabolic risk factor of MASLD, can substantially raise the risk of mortality depending on a patient’s body mass index (&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_889b45cd17a07af55bd0691d1ab1a332" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;BMI&lt;/span&gt;), which is a formula used to estimate body fat percentage based on an individual’s height and weight. The higher a patient’s BMI, the higher the association with death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the research adds to the growing body of research that patients with more cardiometabolic risk factors have poorer outcomes. The study found that the risk of death in MASLD patients increased by 15% for each additional cardiometabolic risk factor present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How the study was conducted&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which collected health information about children and adults in the United States from 1988-2018, the most current year for which data were available for their study. Out of 134,515 participants 20 years or older, some 21,000 patients qualified as having MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors tracked all-cause mortality rates by individual cardiometabolic risk factors to reach their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the study authors hope to conduct further studies examining patients’ genetic background, dietary habits, and alcohol use in relation to MASLD outcomes to provide more comprehensive risk profiles. “The more we can understand about the drivers of the disease, the more we can identify those most in need of interventions and prioritize our resources for enhanced outcomes,” said Terrault.&lt;/p&gt;
