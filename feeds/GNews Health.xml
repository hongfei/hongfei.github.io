    &lt;p&gt;Dr.
Lois Anne Cook (née Simmons), age 76, passed away on November 3,
2025, in Eureka, California. Born on October 22, 1949, in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lois lived a life defined by service,
compassion, and an unwavering dedication to healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
pursued her medical education at the David Geffen School of Medicine
at UCLA and completed her residency in pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center. Her commitment to public health led her to serve as a
Fellow in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control from 1985 to 1987, where she focused on the
epidemiology of birth defects and developmental disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Her
career was marked by a deep devotion to children and families. From
June 1988 to June 1999, she served as a developmental pediatrician
and multidisciplinary team leader for the United States Department of
Defense’s Exceptional Family Member Program. In this role, she worked
tirelessly to ensure that military families with special needs
children received the support and care they deserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In
June 2001, Lois founded Comprehensive Pediatric Care, P.C., where she
served as owner and pediatrician until May 2013. Her practice was not
just a place of medicine but a sanctuary of hope for countless
families. She later continued her work as a developmental
pediatrician at Open Door Clinic from June 2013 to July 2014 and then
as a pediatric hospitalist at Mad River Community Hospital beginning
in October 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
also gave generously of her time as a mentor with the Meritius
Foundation, helping guide and inspire future generations of
caregivers and leaders. Her professional life was a testament to her
belief that every child deserved not only medical care but also
affirmation, encouragement, and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Outside
of her professional accomplishments, Lois lived with profound
spiritual depth. Her spirituality transcended any single tradition —
it was an ever-present force in how she moved through life, treated
others, and found meaning in both the ordinary and extraordinary.
Whether hiking with her beloved dogs Lulu and Muzzy or listening to
meditation books through her earbuds, she found peace and purpose in
nature and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Every
day, rain or shine, she walked Lulu and Muzzy at the dog park near
her home in McKinleyville. During blackberry season, she would return
from those walks with bags full of berries she had picked along the
way — simple joys that reflected her deep connection to the world
around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois
was an avid reader with an extensive library that reflected both her
intellectual curiosity and spiritual journey. She inspired countless
people to believe in themselves and pursue their dreams. Through her
example, she showed that anything is possible when guided by love,
faith, and determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She
leaves behind her daughter Jennifer Paris; her sister Jeanne; and
brothers Leon, John, Mark, and Joe. She was preceded in death by her
daughter Marian Jessica Cook and brother Danny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lois’s
legacy lives on in the lives of those she touched — patients who
felt truly seen and heard under her care; colleagues who were
uplifted by her wisdom; family members who were nourished by her
love; and friends who were transformed by her presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
She
was truly an instrument of God — relentless in her pursuit of
healing, committed wholly to service, and gifted with one of the most
compassionate hearts imaginable. She gave selflessly — never
hesitating to offer help or comfort — and never stopped searching
for answers when it came to those under her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
May
her memory bring comfort to all who knew her and continue to inspire
those who follow in her footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The obituary above was submitted on behalf of Dr. Lois Cook’s loved ones.

			&lt;p&gt;A new, small study suggests children with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, and anorexia share similarly disrupted gut microbiomes, which, by some measures, have more in common with each other than with their healthy, neurotypical peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from &lt;span&gt;Comenius University in Slovakia, the study used stool samples to assess the gut microbiomes of 117 children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exploratory study included 30 boys with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ASD)&lt;/span&gt;, 21 girls with anorexia nervosa, and 14 children with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD). The remaining samples were from age- and sex-matched healthy and neurotypical children, providing a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-people-in-your-life-are-sharing-their-gut-microbes-with-you"&gt;The People in Your Life Are Sharing Their Gut Microbes With You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratio of two dominant groups of microbes in the human gut, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteroidota"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillota"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was higher across all three disorder groups than was typically seen in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This increase in &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;, especially in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73013" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ASD&lt;/a&gt;, and a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/i&gt;, particularly in ADHD and AN, corresponds with findings in inflammatory diseases, where altered ratios have been linked to glucose metabolism, inflammation, and satiety regulation," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ADHD and autism groups, the richness of microbiome species was lower than usual. The researchers measured higher levels of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, microbes that typically hang out in our body without causing damage, yet cause serious infections when elevated in numbers or migrate out of place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desulfovibrio"&gt;Desulfovibrio&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;bacteria were more abundant in children with ADHD and girls with anorexia nervosa. These bacteria are known for living in low-nutrient, waterlogged environments, where they reduce sulfate as a source of energy. They also commonly reside in the human gut, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11071772"&gt;at low levels,&lt;/a&gt; potentially causing disease when they grow out of balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, children with ADHD and girls with anorexia nervosa both harbored fewer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faecalibacterium"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than their peers. This bacterium is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2013.06.003"&gt;usually quite abundant&lt;/a&gt; in healthy human microbiomes, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuad039"&gt;lower levels have been associated&lt;/a&gt; with inflammatory conditions like irritable bowel disease, colorectal  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Notably, certain resemblances were observed in the microbiotic taxa abundances across all patient cohorts, underscoring the conceivable influence of gut microbiota composition on the behavioral manifestations of mental disorders," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/halloween-candy-can-overload-your-gut-microbiome-expert-warns"&gt;diet has a direct impact&lt;/a&gt; on the diversity and species that make up our gut microbiomes: less variety on the menu typically means &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria"&gt;less variety&lt;/a&gt; in our gut flora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picky, slow, and restrictive or excessive eating are common &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361321995631"&gt;among children with autism&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251314223"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; due to sensory issues, and deliberate food restriction is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/disordered-eating-vs-eating-disorders-whats-the-difference"&gt;defining feature of anorexia nervosa&lt;/a&gt;. Similarities in the gut microbiomes of these children may arise from their limited diets. Changes to the gut microbiome can also exacerbate mental health problems, and these, in turn, may impact the gut, further contributing to a positive-feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note their plans for this research were disrupted by the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="181388" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, significantly limiting data collection and resulting in the small sample size here. They also note that some children were not keen on cooperating with their parents in collecting stool samples, further limiting the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given these limitations, our findings should be interpreted with caution," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;they write&lt;/a&gt;. It's unclear, for instance, whether these gut profiles contribute to the children's conditions, are a result of them, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hope future studies can replicate their methods with a much larger sample size to gather more reliable profiles of gut microbiomes in children with these disorders, which &lt;span&gt;could one day &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-identifies-gut-microbe-imbalances-that-predict-autism-and-adhd"&gt;help with diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2025.08.020"&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"We want residents to be aware, watch for symptoms, and make sure they're protected with the MMR vaccine. Community awareness and quick action to limit exposures are key to preventing additional cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge anyone who thinks they were exposed to a measles carrier to watch for symptoms linked to the virus for 21 days after a possible exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms can include fever, cough, runny nose, and red or watery eyes, followed by a rash that starts on the head or face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Central Utah Health Department says anyone who suspects they've been infected with measles should stay home and call their health care provider before seeking care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials remind the public that the best way to prevent the illness is vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two doses of MMR prevent more than 97% of infections. The vaccine is widely available through health care providers, pharmacies, and (Central Utah Health Department) clinics," the department said in its release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why strength training is best for your knees&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research shows aerobic exercise, such as swimming, cycling or walking, is important for those with osteoarthritis to help &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/natural-ways-to-relieve-arthritis-pain/"&gt;reduce pain&lt;/a&gt; and improve quality of life, a strength training routine is crucial if you want to boost your knee health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’re going to have to do something weight-bearing to help the knees,” she explains. This is because compressive forces – which put downward pressure on the knee – stimulate the growth of cartilage cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key is to try and maximise the amount of compressive force you’re getting through the joints, while minimising gliding forces [forward and backward motion].” Working the knee in this way is key to preventing and easing any pain that occurs in or around the joint, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/matt-roberts-best-exercises-strengthen-knees/"&gt;strengthening the main muscle groups of the knees&lt;/a&gt; – your quads, hamstring, calves and glutes – give you better control of the joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can strengthen those muscle groups, you’re going to keep your knees healthier. That’s whether you’ve got no damage at all, wear and tear or &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/foods-help-arthritis-symptoms/"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the best three exercises you can do for your knees, according to Macdonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Squats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most useful exercise is squats,” Macdonald says. “They can sound intimidating but, fundamentally, it’s just standing up and sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really simple movement pattern but you get serious bang for your buck with it. You’ve got your weight going through both legs; it’s a really safe thing to do; you’ve got compression of the cartilage; the concentration of the quad muscles in your upper thigh; glute activity; and, more broadly, you’re getting a cardiovascular workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to do squats if you have no knee pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with your feet pointing straight forward, keeping your chest and core engaged. Next, bend your knees, going down into a sitting position, until your thighs are nearly parallel with the ground. Allow the knees to move forward, over the centre of your feet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ya4rf005v28qo6jdw30cz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States may be heading into its second severe flu season in a row, driven by a mutated strain called subclade K that’s behind early surges in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagh00022e6ft0anr0jv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last winter’s season was extreme, too.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The US had &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2839724" target="_blank"&gt;its highest rates&lt;/a&gt; of flu hospitalizations in nearly 15 years. At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;280 children died of influenza&lt;/a&gt;, the highest number since pediatric death numbers were required to be shared in 2004.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagh00032e6fxahxk6yf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, with a new variant in the mix, experts say we’re on track for a repeat. And with flu vaccinations down and holiday travel on the way, they worry that things may look much worse in the weeks ahead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00042e6fie4bakk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The good news: Early analysis shows that this season’s flu shots offer some protection against being hospitalized with this variant, especially for kids. The bad news is that many Americans appear to be skipping their flu vaccines this year. New data from prescription data company IQVIA shows that vaccinations are down compared to where they usually are at this point in the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00052e6faie3wgb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu activity is low but rising quickly in the United States, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-45.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest FluView report&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00062e6ftpq3qx8l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the flu viruses identified this season have been an A strain called H3N2, and half of those have come from subclade K, a variant that was responsible for a rougher-than-normal flu season this summer in the Southern Hemisphere.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00072e6f4we6ksc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That variant wasn’t a major player when scientists decided which strains should be in the annual flu shots, so the vaccines cover a related but slightly different group of viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00082e6fr1hft3se@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not like we’re expecting to get complete loss of protection for the vaccine, but perhaps we might expect a little bit of a drop-off if this is the virus that sort of dominates the season, and early indications are that’s probably going to be the case,” said Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center for studies on the ecology of influenza in animals and birds at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi00092e6fopkchlv1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early analysis by the UK Health Security Agency shows that subclade K has seven gene changes on a key segment of the virus. Those mutations change the shape of this region, making it harder for the body’s defenses to recognize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000a2e6fy0u4w9u3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;predominant thing that our immune system targets with antibodies, and that’s also pretty much what’s in the vaccine,” said Dr. Adam Lauring, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000b2e6fbfs6nfnb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            UKHSA scientists found that the current flu vaccines are still providing decent protection against subclade K viruses. Vaccination cut the odds of an emergency department visit or hospitalization&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for the flu by almost 75% in children. The effectiveness for adults, even those over 65, was lower, about 30% to 40% against needing to visit the hospital or ER.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ynbrk00033b6qw9uhjq2c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the scientists offer a caveat: These results are from early in the season, before the protection from seasonal flu vaccines has had time to wane or wear off. The findings are posted in a &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/691349457a0ccd6a3aad7fa9/_Flu_interimVE_2526_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recent preprint study&lt;/a&gt;, which means it was published ahead of scrutiny from outside experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi4h9ull00002e6f4valxrnv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some protection is better than no protection, and while subclade K is expected to dominate the season, it won’t be the only flu strain circulating. No one gets to pick what they’re exposed to. Lauring said his daughter has just recovered from the flu, but it was a B-type strain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000c2e6f900nm9hy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the same time this new variant has emerged, flu vaccinations appear to be down in the US. According to IQVIA, about 64% of all flu vaccinations were administered at retail pharmacies, which administered roughly 26.5 million flu shots between&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;August and the end of October. That’s more than 2 million fewer shots than the 28.7 million given over the same time frame in 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000d2e6fqm51il2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not surprised,” said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, who directs the Pandemic Center at Brown University’s School of Public Health. Vaccine skepticism expressed by leaders of the US Department of Health and Human Services has “injected chaos into the whole vaccination system,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000e2e6f4k9arot4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s been a lot of attention on really non-issues,” like vaccine ingredients and separating shots, that “I think, at the best, left people confused but possibly at the worst have left people worried about getting vaccinated,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000f2e6f0nmeyxyj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.racgp.org.au/gp-news/media-releases/2025-media-releases/october-2025/australia-posts-record-breaking-flu-numbers-as-vac" target="_blank"&gt;have also fallen&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, where subclade K was the predominant virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;this year. As a result, flu hit a record, with &lt;a href="https://nindss.health.gov.au/pbi-dashboard/" target="_blank"&gt;more than 443,000 cases&lt;/a&gt;. Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere typically runs from May to July, so infectious disease experts often look to those countries for a preview of what might be on the way to North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000g2e6flj4i5bbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What they saw in Australia is that they had a bad season. And so it’s concerning for you and us, what’s coming,” said Dr. Earl Rubin, director of the infectious disease division at the Montreal Children’s Hospital in Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000h2e6fhbfmji3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s difficult to say whether subclade K actually makes a person sicker than other flu strains, but if it drives more cases, it will certainly drive hospitalizations too, Rubin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000i2e6fdv3vb6vx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you look at severity, the more cases you have, if the same percentage get hospitalized, obviously you’re going to have more hospitalization if you have more cases. So it sometimes will look like&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the severity is also worse,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ya77p00002e6fhvg21jlp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lab testing data has begun to show an uptick in flu cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000j2e6ftdxcoq3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is the time we start to see the rise,” said Dr. Allison McMullen, a clinical microbiologist at BioMerieux, which makes the BioFire test, a popular diagnostic tool for respiratory pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ysxp500053b6q4ybr387l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company anonymously compiles its test results into a &lt;a href="https://syndromictrends.com/" target="_blank"&gt;syndromic surveillance tool&lt;/a&gt;, which can offer a glimpse of what bugs are making people sick at any given time. At the beginning of the month, less than 1% of tests were positive for type A flu. Now it’s 2.4% – still low numbers but going up briskly, which aligns with the CDC trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000k2e6f1zfy2bzv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to start seeing heavy holiday travel before we know it,” McMullen added. “With the rising cases that we’re seeing the UK and Japan, it can definitely be a bellwether for what we’re going to see in North America.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000l2e6fq8zw1ye8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Signals &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?charts=CjcQACABSABaC0luZmx1ZW56YSBBcgoyMDI1LTEwLTA2cgoyMDI1LTExLTE3igEGYTc3NzdjwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=a7777c" target="_blank"&gt;are also rising&lt;/a&gt; in wastewater, said Dr. Marlene Wolfe, an assistant professor of environmental health at Emory University. In October, 18% of samples in the WastewaterSCAN network – an academically led wastewater monitoring program based at Stanford University, in partnership with Emory – were positive for type A flu, Wolfe said. In November, that number had risen to 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000m2e6fzwjx3fo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu is something where, when it’s not in season, we don’t detect it very frequently in wastewater,” Wolfe said. Covid, on the other hand, can be detected pretty much all the time, which makes it challenging to know if it’s going up or down, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000n2e6fnifoulpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scientists can set a threshold for when they can declare that a specific area is in flu season, Wolfe says. So far, just four of the 147 sites they monitor in 40 states have reached that threshold. Those sites are in the Northeast – in Maine and Vermont – in Iowa and in Hawaii.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000o2e6fv0wsin8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am concerned, I guess, that we could have a big flu season this year based on what we’re seeing in other parts of the world, and particularly Europe and elsewhere,” Michigan’s Lauring said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3yaagi000p2e6fjkwaldxn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not too late. Go and get your flu shot,” Lauring advised. “And be alert that it’s out there.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Every winter is a different flu season,” said Barouch. “Some seasons are more severe than others, and in some seasons the vaccines are more effective. It is largely driven by mutations that occur every year in flu.” Those gradual changes, known as antigenic drift, can make vaccines less effective at preventing infection and contribute to a more severe flu season.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The culprit is a drifted version of H3N2, a subtype of influenza A that has circulated for decades. This variant, dubbed “subclade K,” carries several new mutations. UK leaders are warning of a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/14/flu-mutated-strain-uk-hospitals-winter-surge"&gt;once-in-a-decade&lt;/a&gt;” winter surge as more young people test positive for the subtype. . The variant has also been detected in Canada and Japan, where public health authorities declared a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures#:~:text=Japan%20is%20seeing%20early%20and,Smederevac%20/%20iStock" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/influenza-general/japan-sees-early-flu-activity-school-closures#:~:text=Japan%20is%20seeing%20early%20and,Smederevac%20/%20iStock"&gt;flu epidemic last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The latest Massachusetts Department of Public Health dashboard &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting"&gt;shows low flu activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Historically, patterns in the UK have often signaled what is ahead for Massachusetts winters, and this year is no exception, Barouch said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The concern is that the H3N2 strain in England carries a cluster of additional mutations that scientists have not seen before, meaning this year’s shot is less able to prevent infections, although health experts still expect it to offer meaningful protection against severe illness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The impact of those mutations is still being studied, so we do not know for sure,” Barouch said. “But it is likely that those mutations will result in partial evasion of the current vaccine and a more rapid spread.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Individual patients will not be able to tell which strain they have unless they are tested. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What we might see on a population level, since the uptick of the flu season appears to be a bit earlier, is that there is a possibility it could peak at higher levels and be more drawn out.

It may influence gene activity in ways that support heart health, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;In a small but detailed study, 20 healthy adults drank about two cups of 100% orange juice every day for two months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, North Carolina State University and the University of California, Davis, tracked changes in more than 1,700 genes within participants' immune cells, finding broad shifts in genetic activity tied to blood pressure, fat metabolism and inflammation — all key factors in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cardiovascular health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/orange-juice-sugar-cuts-proposed-fda-help-citrus-growers-what-means-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORANGE JUICE SUGAR CUTS PROPOSED BY FDA TO HELP CITRUS GROWERS: WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how citrus flavonoids — plant compounds also found in berries, tea and cocoa that act as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories — may influence the body at a molecular level. The research was published in the journal Molecular Nutrition &amp;amp; Food Research in late October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the changes among participants pointed toward lower inflammation and healthier blood vessel function, though responses differed by body weight. Normal-weight participants showed shifts in inflammation-related genes, while &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;those who were overweight&lt;/a&gt; displayed changes tied to fat metabolism and energy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study suggests that drinking orange juice daily may influence genes linked to heart health.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings reinforce the therapeutic potential of orange juice by providing unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms behind its health effects," the researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"Orange juice isn't an elixir — it's one deeply studied example."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also suggest that body weight "may influence molecular response to bioactive compounds in OJ and provide information for personalized recommendations on the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/fruit-vegetable-coatings-grocery-store-produce-spotlight-know-what-were-eating" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COATINGS ON GROCERY-STORE PRODUCE IN THE SPOTLIGHT: 'KNOW WHAT WE'RE EATING'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cautioned that the study was small and lacked a control beverage, showing associations rather than proof of cause and effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said more research is needed to determine whether these molecular shifts translate into &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;clinical benefits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study found that orange juice affected genes differently based on body weight.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicolette Pace, a registered dietitian nutritionist from New York, said &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; supports using plant compounds to promote longevity and reduce future disease risk, but noted that while changes in gene expression and health are interconnected, they are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="c-link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Orange juice isn't an elixir — it's one deeply studied example," Pace told Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, she said, the new study "opens the door to incredible possibilities for how &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;individualized nutrition&lt;/a&gt; can truly work."

This highlights the direct link between nighttime light exposure and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. As reported, even the small amounts of light at night could have significantly caused long-term effects on heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study relied on advanced brain imaging techniques and satellite measurements to explore how artificial light affects the cardiovascular system. The researchers discovered that higher exposure to nighttime light was associated with increased brain stress activity, inflammation in blood vessels, and a greater likelihood of developing heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Simple Bedtime Practices From Sadhguru For Better Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How environmental factors and nighttime light affect heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that environmental factors, such as air and noise pollution, can contribute to heart disease by affecting nerves and blood vessels through stress,” said Dr. Shady Abohashem, head of cardiac PET/CT imaging trials at Massachusetts General Hospital and instructor at Harvard Medical School. He emphasised that while light pollution is widespread, its effect on cardiovascular health has not been well studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, Dr. Abohashem and his team analysed data from 466 healthy adults with a median age of 55. All participants underwent PET/CT scans, and researchers measured the amount of artificial light in their homes at night. The study followed these individuals for a decade, between 2005 and 2018, tracking major heart-related events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the link between nighttime light and heart stress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the ten-year follow-up, 17% of participants experienced significant heart problems. Those exposed to higher levels of artificial light at night consistently showed elevated brain stress activity and increased inflammation in their arteries. The study found that each rise in light exposure corresponded with a 35% increased risk of heart disease over five years and a 22% increase over ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abohashem noted, “We observed an almost linear relationship: the more exposure to nighttime light, the higher the heart disease risk. Even modest increases in light at night were associated with stress responses in the brain and arteries.” The study explains that when the brain detects stress, it triggers an immune response that causes inflammation in blood vessels. Over time, this process contributes to atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, significantly increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke. These risks remained even after accounting for traditional factors such as noise pollution, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the risk was highest among participants living in low-income or high-traffic areas, where artificial light exposure tends to be greater. This suggests that environmental conditions play a critical role in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical steps to reduce nighttime light exposure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep bedrooms as dark as possible to reduce artificial light exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid using screens such as phones, tablets, or TVs before bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use blackout curtains to block external light from entering your room.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a sleep mask to shield your eyes from residual light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advocate for community measures like shielding streetlights to limit light pollution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimise unnecessary outdoor lighting around homes and neighbourhoods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage the use of motion-sensitive lights to reduce constant nighttime illumination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abohashem remarked, “Light pollution is more than just an inconvenience; it can actively increase the risk of heart disease. Clinicians and policymakers should consider this factor in prevention strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Additional risks beyond the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dangers of nighttime light exposure extend beyond cardiovascular health. Previous studies have linked bright outdoor lights at night with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Artificial light can disrupt the body’s circadian rhythm, leading to poor sleep quality, insomnia, and sleep deprivation, all of which contribute to cognitive decline. For older adults, the correlation between light exposure and Alzheimer’s risk was stronger than other factors such as alcohol use, depression, obesity, or chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article summarises research published by Harvard University and reported by ScienceDaily.

&lt;p&gt;U.S. health authorities, under the direction of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., are considering how they might discourage or even ban vaccines that rely on a common ingredient to boost their effectiveness, or break up ones that protect against multiple diseases in a single shot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If policymakers follow through on these ideas, vaccine makers could have to develop new alternatives to several key vaccines, a process that can take a decade or more and cost upwards of $1 billion, employees of vaccine makers said. The changes would impact a substantial share of the shots on the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Should the administration seek rapid changes to vaccine ingredients, certain shots could become less available and protection against dangerous diseases that haven’t been a widespread threat in decades — including measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and polio — could wither.&lt;/p&gt;

While many people rely on medication to manage symptoms, not everyone tolerates the side effects, and some prefer to explore more natural approaches. Nutrient deficiencies caused by dietary habits, lifestyle patterns and underlying health factors may contribute to a higher risk of migraine attacks. Understanding how these nutrients work in the body can offer valuable insight into more personalised migraine management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are increasingly convinced that low levels of key vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, riboflavin, magnesium, and coenzyme Q10, may significantly impact the development, severity, and duration of migraines. A growing body of research suggests that supplementing these essential nutrients could help safely reduce the intensity, frequency, and duration of migraine episodes for certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;7 Common cravings and the vitamin deficiencies they indicate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding how vitamin D deficiency increases &lt;keyword id="30752139" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="migraine-risk" source="Orion"&gt;migraine risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in recent years suggests that vitamin D supplementation may benefit individuals with recurrent migraines, particularly those whose vitamin D levels are below the recommended range. Vitamin D interacts with metabolic pathways and hormonal systems that influence how the brain and body process sensory information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When levels are low, the likelihood of experiencing migraine pain may increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is also involved in reducing inflammation and regulating nitric oxide levels. Both processes are linked to migraine development. It influences neurotransmitter release, which affects how the brain responds to pain signals. A deficiency may therefore disrupt these systems and heighten migraine susceptibility. Another reason vitamin D matters is its close relationship with magnesium. The body requires adequate vitamin D to absorb magnesium effectively and magnesium deficiency itself is associated with migraine. Low vitamin D levels may therefore compound the problem by impairing magnesium absorption, increasing the chance of experiencing more frequent or severe attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; recommends a daily intake of 15 micrograms of vitamin D for adults up to age seventy and 20 micrograms for those over seventy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How magnesium strengthens neurological stability and lowers migraine risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium works alongside vitamin D to support numerous bodily functions, including nerve signalling and neuromuscular stability. Research strongly supports an association between magnesium deficiency and migraine, with studies showing that increasing magnesium levels may reduce both the frequency and intensity of episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium plays a protective role by helping prevent excessive neuronal excitation. When nerve cells become overstimulated, migraines can occur more readily. Ensuring sufficient magnesium intake may therefore reduce the likelihood of this neurological overactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;advises a daily intake of 310 to 320 milligrams of magnesium for females and 400 to 420 milligrams for males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Riboflavin supports cellular energy and helps reduce migraine frequency&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, supports mitochondrial energy production within cells. Some studies link mitochondrial dysfunction to the development of migraine, suggesting that riboflavin supplementation may help improve energy metabolism and reduce migraine frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review of clinical research shows encouraging results. Several trials in adults demonstrate that riboflavin can reduce the number of migraine episodes, although evidence for children and adolescents appears more mixed. Another study examining a combination of 400 milligrams of riboflavin, 600 milligrams of magnesium and 150 milligrams of coenzyme Q10 found that this blend may improve symptoms and lessen the overall burden of migraine when taken consistently for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily intake recommendations from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Riboflavin-Consumer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;are 1.1 milligrams of riboflavin for females and 1.3 milligrams for males, but therapeutic doses used in studies are often significantly higher. Anyone considering supplementation should consult a healthcare professional for appropriate guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coenzyme Q10s role in mitochondrial function and migraine prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coenzyme Q10 is another nutrient crucial for mitochondrial energy production. Low levels may influence how efficiently cells generate energy, a function believed to play a role in migraine development. Some evidence suggests that supplementing coenzyme Q10 could help prevent migraine headaches, although further large-scale research is needed before it becomes a universally recommended therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People interested in exploring coenzyme Q10 supplementation should discuss it with a clinician to determine suitability and dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes migraines and how nutrient levels influence their severity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraine is one of the most common neurological conditions worldwide and can significantly affect daily life. It is estimated that around twelve per cent of the global population experiences migraines, including many children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ihs-headache.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1477_ichd-iir1final-1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;International Headache Society &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;recognises two main forms of migraine. Migraine without aura involves moderate or severe head pain lasting between 4 and 72 hours, often accompanied by nausea, light sensitivity, sound sensitivity and worsening symptoms during physical activity. Migraine with aura includes temporary neurological disturbances such as visual flashes, sensory changes, speech difficulties or motor disturbances that develop gradually and typically last between five and sixty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triggers can vary greatly. Some individuals react to specific foods, while others respond to environmental factors such as weather changes or strong smells. Episodes may also be linked to dehydration, stress, hormonal fluctuations or irregular sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrient deficiencies may be an additional contributing factor, making dietary support and supplementation a valuable consideration for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for managing migraine effectively&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helpful lifestyle strategies and complementary therapies for managing migraine pain:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anyone experiencing frequent or severe migraines should seek medical advice for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.

I would say it's a glimpse into the future, but it's happening right now, it's a pretty horrific thought."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So can AI outpace bacterial evolution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"That's a very good question, I think what we've seen is that if we can get a few good antibiotics, then we'll be back on on the front foot and then I think we can keep things in check," says Dr Edwards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dd8c/live/c506b590-c3ba-11f0-8b5b-6b842c57bf0d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dd8c/live/c506b590-c3ba-11f0-8b5b-6b842c57bf0d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd8c/live/c506b590-c3ba-11f0-8b5b-6b842c57bf0d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dd8c/live/c506b590-c3ba-11f0-8b5b-6b842c57bf0d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dd8c/live/c506b590-c3ba-11f0-8b5b-6b842c57bf0d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dd8c/live/c506b590-c3ba-11f0-8b5b-6b842c57bf0d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dd8c/live/c506b590-c3ba-11f0-8b5b-6b842c57bf0d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd8c/live/c506b590-c3ba-11f0-8b5b-6b842c57bf0d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Imperial A stone representation of Alexander Fleming on the side wall of a building, which says Fleming Discovered Penicillin'" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Imperial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The Fleming Initiative is named after Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin in 1928 and started the antibiotic age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even by the time he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 80 years ago, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/fleming-lecture.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;he had warned of the dangers of resistance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Alison Holmes, the director of the Fleming Initiative, said antibiotics were "one of the greatest health resources that has been squandered" and we should all think of how much we owe to antibiotics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Whether it's that time we stepped on a nail and or got cellulitis following an insect bite or our C-section wound, or our UTI, or our STI - we all depend on them," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The collaboration will also use AI like a weather forecast to predict how superbugs emerge and spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And the project is also looking beyond bacteria to use AI to tackle the rise of deadly fungal infections, starting with Aspergillus mould.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Its spores are normally harmless, but can become deadly in people with weakened immune systems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Tony Wood, the chief scientific officer at GSK, said: "We will open up new approaches for the discovery of novel antibiotics as well as anticipate and outpace the development of resistance to transform the treatment and prevention of serious infections." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Researchers in the US and Canada have already started using AI to shortlist drugs or even design antibiotics from scratch to target drug-resistant bacteria like gonorrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nearly-400-antibiotic-resistant-infections-each-week-in-2024" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Data for the UK&lt;/a&gt;

Chronically high intake increases the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. These, in turn, contribute to elevated triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol, high blood pressure, and systemic inflammation—all powerful drivers of coronary artery disease and heart attacks.​&lt;br&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523137178"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition revealed that adults who consume the most sugar-sweetened beverages are over 12% more likely to develop hypertension and heart disease compared to those consuming the least. Mechanistically, added sugars—particularly fructose—have been shown to increase myocardial oxygen demand, increase heart rate, and intensify blood pressure variability, all of which stress the heart and the arterial system.&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, chronic influx of sugar leads to chronic low-grade inflammation—recognized as a central pathway to atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing of the arteries), ultimately raising the chance of plaque rupture and heart attacks. Prospective cohort studies cited by the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000167"&gt;BMJ &lt;/a&gt;and others highlight a dose-response relationship: those deriving over 20% of their day’s energy from added sugars have a markedly higher risk of heart events, and risk multiplies past the 25% mark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 04:49:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这种廉价的抗炎药可以降低心脏病发作和中风的风险- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/this-inexpensive-anti-inflammatory-pill-could-reduce-risk-of-heart-attack-and-stroke/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 04:10:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOVDVCZ0xyQUxPMTdTV19xQVEtY1ZmZnFlLXduSjZ0RUpFRUhTdHdsXzZTLXAxNUlMaGJZeW94eW94TUdSY2VPNzdnV3RqTThINS1EdmJVdGpyS0FjTVkwNDIxckFMTEtSWkNnTWxZVE15T1d3b0NkZE1QcWYxN25meGNNZWd4bGZLVmI2ZnlwWE9nSXdzMGlrOHBxYVFXb0FYcVJrMllZcUJkdEQtQnRj</guid></item><item><title>Fahey/Klein画廊和ONE画廊： Herb Ritts ：盟友和图标-摄影之眼</title><link>https://loeildelaphotographie.com/en/fahey-klein-gallery-one-gallery-herb-ritts-allies-icons/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Eye of Photography</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 04:01:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNRVJCTkFvdkVhdlNfS0ZHZk9odDRfeHMtTnNCUy1WRzJQcHVoQ2pya0JXZFdyQ2xhYXE5TzRqSWhGUlp5WEhudDRTaUFWUEhGa0MzeTBtZl9rX2p6MVo4SklNN3lJOGpQMWx0Z1NteFd0QXVjV0U4SUpxQzNBUEY4RGlKclpTRkRnQ1ZBNThCZkRhS2I4NVlxaw</guid></item><item><title>“月经掩蔽”正在传播病毒，但它真的对你的皮肤有好处吗？ - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/menstrual-masking-is-going-viral-but-is-it-really-that-good-for-your-skin</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving world of beauty trends, few have sparked as much debate – and discomfort – as "menstrual masking". This is the practice of applying menstrual blood to the skin, usually the face, as a form of DIY skincare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Popularised on &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/social-media-109"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, hashtags such as #periodfacemask have amassed billions of views. In most videos, users apply menstrual blood for a few minutes before rinsing it off. There's no clear agreement on how much &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/blood-2517"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; to use or how long to leave it on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some call the practice healing or empowering, describing it as a spiritual ritual that connects them to their bodies and ancestral femininity. But what does the science say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-aging-injections-hide-environmental-costs-we-may-not-want-to-pay"&gt;Anti-Aging Injections Hide Environmental Costs We May Not Want to Pay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates of menstrual masking often argue that period blood contains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266657192400032X"&gt;stem cells, cytokines, and proteins&lt;/a&gt; that could rejuvenate the skin. There is currently no clinical evidence to support using menstrual blood as a topical skincare treatment. However, its biological composition has shown potential in medical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fj.201800086R"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; found that plasma derived from menstrual fluid could significantly enhance wound healing. In laboratory tests, wounds treated with menstrual plasma showed 100% repair within 24 hours compared with 40% using regular blood plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This remarkable regeneration is thought to be linked to the unique proteins and bioactive molecules in menstrual fluid: the same substances that allow the uterus to rebuild itself every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now exploring whether synthetic menstrual fluid could help treat chronic wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="181919" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Stem cell&lt;/a&gt; research has also turned attention to menstrual blood–derived  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="181919" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, or MenSCs. These cells grow easily and can develop into many different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181932" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181932" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Mesenchymal-stem-cells-in-red-under-microscope.jpg" alt="Red cells with blue string-like projections surrounding them" class="size-full wp-image-181932" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Mesenchymal-stem-cells-in-red-under-microscope.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Mesenchymal-stem-cells-in-red-under-microscope-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181932" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mesenchymal stem cells (red) viewed under a microscope. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADCSQd7y2Y/"&gt;vshivkova/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4904135/"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from various sources can help heal skin by boosting collagen, reducing wrinkles, and releasing growth factors that repair damage caused by burns, UV exposure, or wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they are versatile and appear safe, MenSCs are seen as a promising option for developing medical treatments to regenerate skin and slow photoaging: the premature aging caused by long-term sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not the same as a "vampire facial"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some menstrual masking advocates liken the practice to the so-called "vampire facial": a cosmetic procedure popularised by celebrities such as &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13528165.2023.2222357"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;. Vampire facials use &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/cosmetic/younger-looking/platelet-rich-plasma-secret-to-younger-skin#:%7E:text=Is%20PRP%20safe?,Who%20can%20have%20PRP%20rejuvenation?"&gt;platelet-rich plasma (PRP)&lt;/a&gt; extracted from a patient's own blood and injected into the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts caution against comparing PRP with menstrual blood. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266657192400032X"&gt;Menstrual fluid&lt;/a&gt; is a complex mixture of blood, sloughed-off endometrial tissue (the uterine lining), vaginal secretions, hormones, and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it passes through the vaginal canal, it can pick up bacteria and fungi, including &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, a common microbe that normally lives on the skin but can cause infections if it enters cuts or pores. There's also a risk that sexually transmitted infections (STIs) could be transferred to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRP, by contrast, is &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/cosmetic/younger-looking/platelet-rich-plasma-secret-to-younger-skin"&gt;prepared under sterile conditions&lt;/a&gt;. During &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/cosmetic/younger-looking/platelet-rich-plasma-secret-to-younger-skin"&gt;PRP treatment&lt;/a&gt;, a small amount of blood is drawn and spun in a centrifuge to separate out the platelet-rich layer, which is then injected into the skin using fine needles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some clinicians also add filler for faster cosmetic results. The procedure can cost thousands; unlike menstrual masking, which is free and easily accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Body-based" beauty&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual masking isn't the only unconventional beauty practice involving bodily fluids. "Urine therapy," the application of urine to the skin, has roots in Ayurvedic medicine and was once believed to detoxify the body and cure ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some modern advocates even claim &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633214/"&gt;benefits for acne&lt;/a&gt; or eczema, although these claims lack scientific support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While urine does contain urea – a compound used in some moisturisers – the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8611129/"&gt;urea found in urine&lt;/a&gt; is far less concentrated and not the same as the purified, synthetic form used in skincare products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that raw urine or menstrual blood could safely replace clinical-grade cosmetic ingredients is not supported by dermatological evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual masking sits at the intersection of body positivity, cultural ritual, and pseudoscience. For some, it's a celebration of the menstrual cycle and a rejection of stigma. For others, it's an unproven and potentially risky beauty trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biological richness of menstrual blood is undeniable, but its safe and effective use belongs in controlled medical research – not in DIY skincare routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with many viral health trends, it's vital to distinguish between symbolism and science. Menstrual masking may feel empowering, but from a dermatological perspective, it's a practice best left to personal belief rather than the bathroom mirror.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/266648/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A small population of nerve cells appears to be responsible for blood flow and neural activity across the entire brain, findings that could have significant implications in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/better-sleep-could-help-your-brain-flush-out-dementia-linked-toxins"&gt;study of sleep&lt;/a&gt;, dementia, and overall brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of cell is referred to as a type-I nNOS neuron. Found in sparse numbers &lt;span&gt;mostly in deep cortical layers, they &lt;/span&gt;are considered to be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1357-19.2019"&gt;vulnerable to mental stress&lt;/a&gt;. To understand more about the type-I nNOS neuron's role, researchers from Pennsylvania State University selectively removed them from the brains of mice to study the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without type-I nNOS neurons, the brains exhibited reduced blood flow, weaker pulsation of the blood (known as vasomotion), and decreased neural activity. Slow brain waves called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wave"&gt;delta waves&lt;/a&gt; also became weaker, and the left and right sides of the mice's brains were less in sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/our-brains-evolved-powerful-mechanisms-to-protect-our-weight"&gt;Our Brains Evolved Powerful Mechanisms To Protect Our Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In your brain, arteries, veins, and capillaries help move fluid around by constantly dilating and constricting every few seconds, which we call spontaneous oscillation," &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/engineering/story/its-not-just-your-head-stress-may-lead-altered-blood-flow-brain"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical engineer Patrick Drew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous work from our lab has shown that nNOS neurons are important for regulating blood flow in the brain. After targeting and eliminating a subset of these neurons, we observed a significant reduction in the amplitude of these oscillations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181426" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181426" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/NeuronCharts.jpg" alt="Neuron diagram" class="wp-image-181426 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/NeuronCharts.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/NeuronCharts-600x360.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181426" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Type-I nNOS neurons (in yellow) are much less abundant than other types, and were selectively removed by the researchers. (Patrick Drew)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests type-I nNOS neurons may play a role in several key brain processes. For example, delta waves are closely associated with sleep, and the researchers noticed that the reduction in blood flow and neural activity was higher during sleep. That means type-I nNOS neurons could be vital to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-reveal-surprising-tipping-point-minutes-before-we-fall-asleep"&gt;healthy sleep cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasomotion, meanwhile, is important for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.10.033"&gt;clearing waste&lt;/a&gt; from the brain, a process that goes awry and leads to damage in several neurodegenerative conditions, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="181422" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease and other forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This demonstrates that a small population of nNOS-positive neurons is indispensable for regulating both neural and vascular dynamics in the whole brain, raising the possibility that loss of these neurons could contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and sleep disturbances," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.105649.3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could confirm these links, which have only been observed in mouse brains. There's &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/10973923/why-do-scientists-investigate-mice"&gt;good reason&lt;/a&gt; to believe human brains may operate similarly, implying common neurological disorders may involve disruptions to our own type-I nNOS neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steady &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-blood-could-be-aging-your-brain-increasing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;blood flow in the brain&lt;/a&gt; is essential for delivering oxygen and nutrients, and for regulating mental health. Stress or other factors affecting the cells involved in regulating that flow may present a significant trigger for harm and, therefore, targets for future treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Reduced blood flow is one of many contributing factors to reduced brain function and neurodegenerative diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/engineering/story/its-not-just-your-head-stress-may-lead-altered-blood-flow-brain"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Drew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While we know aging plays a major role in this, losing these rare neurons to chronic stress could be an unexplored environmental cause for poor brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.105649.3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet more benefits were seen around inflammation, a driver for cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our oral health is connected to our general health,” said Dr Sadia Niazi, a senior clinical lecturer in endodontology at King’s College London. “We should never look at our teeth or dental disease as a separate entity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Root canal treatment is one of the most common – and perhaps most feared – dental procedures, though much of the anxiety derives from &lt;a href="https://www.aae.org/patients/root-canal-treatment/myths-root-canals/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;myths and misconceptions&lt;/a&gt; that hark back to the days of poor anaesthetics. The treatment is performed to treat infection or damage to the tooth’s pulp, the soft inner tissue of a tooth that contains nerves, blood vessels and connective tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;According to a public health survey in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/adult-oral-health-survey-2021/adult-oral-health-survey-2021-self-reported-health-of-teeth-and-gums" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than a third&lt;/a&gt; of adults in England had received a root canal treatment, rising to 50% in those aged 55 to 74. In the US, more than 15m root canal procedures are performed each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers followed 65 patients from Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust in London for two years after root canal treatment. Before the procedure and at four points later, they analysed the patients’ blood molecules to see how they processed sugar, fat and other substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dentists know that long-standing tooth infections can lead to bacteria entering the bloodstream. Once circulating, the microbes can increase inflammation and impair the body’s ability to control blood sugar levels. It was unclear, however, whether root canal treatment had benefits beyond clearing up the tooth infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-025-07110-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Journal of Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers describe seeing meaningful changes after root canal treatment in more than half of the blood molecules they analysed. The results point to short-term improvements in fat metabolism and long-term improvements in blood sugar levels. Markers for inflammation, a driver for a multitude of chronic diseases, dropped after the dental procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not about treating the single tooth. This has long-term benefits on the general health of the patient, particularly the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes,” Niazi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People must understand that your mouth is the main gateway to your general health, so looking after your oral health and doing regular checkups with your dentist and getting disease treated early is the best course of action.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings are particularly important for global health, since chronic tooth infections often go untreated. According to the World &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Organization, 3.7 billion people globally live with untreated oral disease. Given the broader health impact of tooth infections, oral health should be integrated into a patient’s general healthcare, Niazi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The research was published a week after a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf555/8237946?login=false" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; at University College London found treatment for severe gum disease could prevent arteries from becoming clogged, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. The treatment reduced inflammation caused by the gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Marco Orlandi, the trial’s co-principal investigator, said: “Oral conditions such as gum disease have been associated with a plethora of non-communicable disease such as cardiovascular, metabolic, rheumatic and neuro-degenerative conditions.” Gum disease should now be considered a “non-traditional risk factor” for clogged arteries, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 01:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQNl9IbDJrd0VlQTgtcFVnb0Q3SU8zTEpycm81MWY5OXFkQTJ1eUl2bV9uc0ZlOWpfNmFkS0REMGp1NmRFbFpudlh2SEx3Rnp2eTVOZ0hrZ0tOQkFJVFZkZWFwY3JSZTZFQmJkdlA3VGxCOVozTGhaM2UteXdBU3lxUy05b3ZCR0FwcXNBeFFIUnFRUkRnR1k1UlJXdUZXZ3luVHdkaldUenh1MTMwcUtuZjZZWjV3NG9xVTBjS183cFdtaG9XSXpR</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心首次将多个州的麻疹疫情联系起来-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/health/measles-us-elimination-status-outbreaks.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:25:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPbmJSZEVXUmttT0tkWWpCOEEyaGg4U3pzd1d6NEJnc2FacWlKOXlieUk4SDJ6YUxPbzhGS2xucW0xMy1SMElTTUhUQ0FDZ3ZkaVNyR0lrRW5kTEY5QVRoakxySEMtSHJEMmxfamRhUjJYSm5oYkNwVHNrcHd2SkRzWTZuX09fUTgwZTU3MXZHQQ</guid></item><item><title>以色列研究人员帮助开发突破性的治疗方法，将血脂减少50%以上- Ynetnews</title><link>https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/rjto004kxze</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-contents="true"&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="ci3si-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ci3si-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ci3si-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;A large international clinical trial led in Israel by Dr. Hofit Cohen of Sheba Medical Center has demonstrated the effectiveness of a new drug that cuts triglyceride levels by more than 50% and sharply reduces life-threatening pancreatitis.

Levels between 150 and 499 are considered elevated, 500 to 999 are significantly high, and anything above 1,000 mg/dL is extremely high and carries a real risk of pancreatitis as well as cardiovascular disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="95i3n-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="95i3n-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="95i3n-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Elevated triglycerides increase the risk for atherosclerosis, heart attacks, strokes and peripheral vascular disease. Very high levels sharply increase the risk for acute pancreatitis, a sometimes life-threatening condition that may require intensive care and can cause permanent damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="6p00d-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6p00d-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6p00d-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Cohen said elevated triglycerides usually result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Diets rich in fats and simple carbohydrates, lack of exercise, heavy alcohol use, uncontrolled diabetes, kidney dysfunction, hypothyroidism, overproduction of cortisol and central obesity are key contributors. Rare genetic disorders can also impair the body’s ability to break down triglycerides, causing extremely high levels from a young age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="duc7m-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.rylGVtNYebl" id="image_ArticleImageData.rylGVtNYebl"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.rylGVtNYebl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2021/06/10/BkXMVKkid/BkXMVKkid_0_0_1000_790_0_x-large.jpg" alt="כולסטרול" title="A 3D illustration of blood fats  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.rylGVtNYebl" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2021/06/10/BkXMVKkid/BkXMVKkid_0_0_1000_790_0_x-large.jpg" alt="כולסטרול" title="A 3D illustration of blood fats  (Photo: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;A 3D illustration of blood fats &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="5p1m4-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5p1m4-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5p1m4-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Treatment generally begins with lifestyle changes: balanced diet, reducing simple carbohydrates, avoiding alcohol, regular exercise and strict diabetes control. Many patients also receive statins to reduce heart disease risk. When levels exceed 500 mg/dL, doctors typically add fibrates or high-dose omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower triglycerides by 30% to 50%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="bidth-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bidth-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bidth-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;For some patients — especially those with levels “in the thousands” — these measures are not enough. They continue to suffer recurrent pancreatitis despite strict adherence. In severe cases, patients undergo plasmapheresis, an invasive procedure to mechanically remove triglycerides from the blood, often weekly or biweekly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="fcnc5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="fcnc5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="fcnc5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In recent years, advanced RNA-based therapies have transformed care for severe hypertriglyceridemia. These treatments target specific proteins involved in triglyceride metabolism. One key protein, apoC-III, naturally slows the breakdown of triglycerides. Suppressing its production significantly boosts the body’s ability to clear fats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="8fg6b-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8fg6b-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8fg6b-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Volanesorsen, the first drug in this class, was approved in Europe.

Eighty-five percent of patients achieved levels below 500 mg/dL, and pancreatitis rates fell by more than 80%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="9hlbj" data-offset-key="u81-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="u81-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="u81-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The drug appeared safe overall, with similar rates of side effects and treatment discontinuation compared with placebo. However, researchers noted several findings requiring monitoring: mild increases in liver enzymes, reduced platelet counts in some patients — more common at higher doses — and dose-dependent increases in liver fat.

Even within households, only about one-third of close contacts become infected when exposed to a contagious individual, Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a precautionary measure, Public Health recommended that 38 people associated with Aegis Living undergo TB evaluation. This process involves a medical risk assessment and a TB test, and the facility will directly contact those needing evaluation. All staff, patients, and their families are being informed of the situation this week, regardless of their exposure level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/tuberculosis-woman-tacoma-pierce-county-health-department-tpchd-17th-order-court-documents-antibiotic-resistance-bacteria-isolation-10-million-cases-washington-state-tb-treatment" target="_blank"&gt;Tacoma woman cured of tuberculosis after court-ordered isolation, treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any individuals are found to have latent TB infection, Public Health will facilitate treatment to eliminate the TB germs and prevent the development of active TB disease. Latent TB infection, which is not contagious, can be treated within three to four months. The individual with active TB is currently receiving treatment from Public Health, which typically involves a six to nine-month course of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active TB disease differs from latent TB infection in that it can be spread to others, while latent TB cannot. In King County, approximately 100,000 people have latent TB infection, with about 5% developing active TB within two years and another 5% over their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB primarily affects the lungs but can also impact other parts of the body. In 2024, King County reported 110 new cases of TB disease, averaging about two diagnoses per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on TB signs, symptoms, and transmission, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpublichealthinsider.com%2F%3Faction%3Duser_content_redirect%26uuid%3D1dbd8cba7b002bf2098f27689ff8fd30ca5072142b8bea2502593b0b48481366%26blog_id%3D70617574%26post_id%3D40730%26user_id%3D245971997%26subs_id%3D119072214%26signature%3D9eadabfc989a6cc6228bd0b1bdb5f84e%26email_name%3Dnew-post%26user_email%3Dtips%40komonews.com%26encoded_url%3DaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2RjLmdvdi90Yi9kZWZhdWx0Lmh0bQ%3D%26email_id%3Db158b64bdecce417e996bd2a5443eedc&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Caberry%40katu.com%7C4ce0973950d84bb29b8108de26313fbc%7C897dbc0dc02d43479a713e589c67f8aa%7C0%7C0%7C638990190128594537%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=GbgllT5ZvFMtdnsVB1gDsHXdVqoiaHNfvwj%2B5oRn%2FoU%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;TB website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 23:52:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwJBVV95cUxNZUFDTWN1UE90RjRHd3hPbWxKeDEtU2NxSTJZVm5qdHRFYldtVDBlSzlrd3U2RkdzcmZncS00Y0FsVlgxRkZOZGhsU080SDZWSEI2cDNUVUpiWndFODloQXpJODZaalMzXzVFTHp1SGxKRzhtbHRpN0N0dGhpQ3RyMnNlcWRlRVJQQWFHRWNMM3JVZnFCNUZHbFNUUXlvbzBhMEhRMkZqVU5JeFp3R1p4LUZEUWNBbWtZTFVOeUlmVXdmWFlHS19selR1LXFGN2dwNVhZN3c4UXVVaHBvZnFTUGhTRU9XaTc0My1OcU5YaGx4aVJYeU9OaGRjQTB2TlRhOUdRQ0JfZzQ5ZUtnVGxtRlpTX1FVVEh0YzBzVmtwekJzNlB1LVBjbnRxVWRYdkU</guid></item><item><title>南佛罗里达州的爸爸在儿子从鬣蜥身上感染沙门氏菌后转向职业生涯；健康专家分享警告- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/south-florida-broward-county-iguanas-salmonella/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;"He was just really off, and started having gastrointestinal issues and just violently ill," said Stephen Dickenson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickenson said his son jumped in their backyard pool after the family was on vacation, before they realized the chlorine was off and there was iguana poop everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, his son got salmonella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk is there and it's real and it's not something that we grew up with, when we were younger, they weren't here so it wasn't something we were taught to think about," Dickenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Father pivots careers after iguana incident &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't a connection the Dickenson's were familiar with before. But his son's sickness pushed Stephen to a career change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became a professional iguana trapper, opening Method Iguana Services based in Pompano Beach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want our kids to go out and have fun in the environment that they're in, and we love all the old growth trees, but with the invasive iguanas coming in and then defecating onto the playground equipment, it's just hand to mouth," Dickenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it's easy to spot iguana poop in parks and playgrounds, often falling from trees above where they gather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What steps can you take to remain safe? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what should you do to keep your family safe? Dickenson suggests that you walk around the park first. If you see a lot of iguanas or droppings, skip that park and find another. You should also wash your child's hands with something antimicrobial after playing, especially before eating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's a major problem in South Florida with iguanas all over," said Dr. Otto Ramos. He's the director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Nicklaus Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramos said it's hard to prove 100% that iguanas cause the infection, but the connection is uncanny, with iguanas known to carry salmonella in their feces and saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He warns they can be aggressive, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had children that have had to be admitted to the hospital and have had serious wounds," Ramos said. "When they bite, the teeth will be embedded in the skin, and it's very difficult to remove them, and they have salmonella in their mouth, so those wounds can get seriously infected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some parks, you'll see wraps around trees to deter the lizards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts said avoiding the risk altogether is the safest bet, especially for pets, children, and the immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a client who is immunocompromised who was a transplant recipient, and his doctor said don't use your pool anymore because if you catch salmonella, that's it, and he said you're 30% more likely to catch salmonella to exposure to an iguana than raw chicken," Dickenson said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you have iguanas in your backyard, try to get rid of them," Ramos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dickenson, though it may sound daunting, it is doable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They get a sense of predation, so when they start getting removed, very quickly they move to neighbors who aren't doing anything about the problem, and so that's how a lot of my clients have been able to reclaim their backyards," Dickenson said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists may have identified a way to naturally regulate blood sugar levels and sugar cravings in a similar fashion to drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice and humans, the key to unlocking this natural process was found to be a gut microbe and its metabolites – the compounds it produces during digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By increasing the abundance of this one gut microbe in diabetic mice, researchers led by a team at Jiangnan University in China &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; they can "orchestrate the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mounjaros-effect-on-brains-cravings-measured-for-the-first-time"&gt;Mounjaro's Effect on Brain's 'Cravings' Measured For The First Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that is naturally produced by the body and which helps regulate blood sugar levels and feelings of fullness. GLP-1's release is stimulated by certain foods and gut microbes, and its mechanism of action is mimicked by drugs like semaglutide (the ingredient behind Ozempic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="181888" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; typically have impaired GLP-1 function, leading to issues with blood sugar control, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-protein-discovery-could-rival-ozempic-with-fewer-side-effects"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and other GLP-1 agonists work as treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These drugs mimic natural processes in the body, and while they have proved very effective, some researchers want to figure out how to get the body to produce more GLP-1 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A growing body of research has revealed that our cravings for dietary components originate from signals sent from the gut, a key organ in transmitting dietary preferences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01902-8"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the authors in their paper published in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, which genes, gut flora, and metabolites in the gut microenvironment are involved in the regulation of sugar preference is currently unclear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests gut microbes like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phocaeicola_vulgatus"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacteroides vulgatus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and their metabolites may help shape a person's sweet tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments, if mice could not produce a gut protein, called Ffar4, the researchers found the gut colonies of &lt;em&gt;B. vulgatus&lt;/em&gt; shrank. This, in turn, led to a decrease in the release of a hormone known as FGF21, which is associated with sugar cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png" alt="New Study Hints at Natural Alternative to Ozempic Hiding in The Gut" class="wp-image-149407 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-642x366.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-729x415.png 729w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-768x437.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-1536x875.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-2048x1167.png 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/biomedicines-12-02328-g001-600x342.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149407" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Diagram of GLP-1 agonist pathway and FGF21 pathway.

                &lt;p&gt;The federal government is officially back to work, and unfortunately, so is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s influence over the country’s public health. Early next month, a panel of outside advisors assembled by Kennedy will meet once again and probably take a sledgehammer to more vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently posted the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt; for the next meeting of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for December 4 and 5. Among other things, ACIP plans to discuss the childhood vaccination schedule as well as “contaminants” in vaccines. Though it’s not exactly clear what ACIP will vote on during this meeting, some of its members will likely try to remove the decades-old recommendation that children be vaccinated against hepatitis B starting at birth—a decision that even some GOP lawmakers are trying to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I want to make America healthy, and you don’t start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier,” Senator Bill Cassidy (R-Louisiana) &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cassidy-louisiana-senator-face-the-nation-transcript-11-16-2025/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; CBS News’ &lt;em&gt;Face the Nation&lt;/em&gt; in an interview released Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The hijacked ACIP&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Kennedy unilaterally dismissed all 17 members of the ACIP, the panel of outside experts that helps guide the CDC’s vaccine policies. He then quickly added new &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-purges-cdcs-vital-vaccine-advisory-committee-2000613732"&gt;advisors&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom—like Kennedy himself—have a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of spreading misinformation about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In its two meetings to date, the rejiggered ACIP has issued several recommendations welcomed by the anti-vaccination movement. It moved to ban &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-vaccine-panel-votes-against-thimerosal-flu-shots-citing-debunked-risks-2000620214"&gt;the few remaining vaccines&lt;/a&gt; that contained thimerosal, for instance, an ingredient that antivaxxers have long accused of causing autism with dubious evidence. Though thimerosal was removed from most vaccines as a precaution in the early 2000s, studies since have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2908388/#:~:text=Twenty%20epidemiologic%20studies%20have%20shown,of%20epidemiologic%20and%20statistical%20methods."&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt; to find any link to autism, and autism rates have only continued to rise. The ACIP also called for children under four to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-handpicked-vaccine-panel-nixes-measles-chickenpox-combo-for-kids-under-4-2000660333"&gt;no longer receive&lt;/a&gt; the combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine (MMRV), a decision that the previous CDC had left up to parents.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These decisions, and the ACIP’s general shift away from science-backed evaluation, have helped fuel the internal collapse of the CDC. In late August, RFK Jr. fired former CDC director Susan Monarez just four weeks into her role, reportedly because she refused to sign off on the ACIP’s recommendations without conducting her own review; soon after, much of the CDC’s senior leadership resigned in protest.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the ACIP’s worst decisions have been limited in their scope. Few vaccines today include thimerosal, and most families weren’t vaccinating their very young children with the MMRV shot. But the potential removal of universal at-birth hepatitis B vaccination threatens to be its most sweeping and damaging change yet.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Unscientific fears&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. In adults, it’s usually transmitted via sex or by sharing contaminated needles. But the virus can also be passed from an infected mother to the child during childbirth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though a hepatitis B infection can be managed with antivirals if it becomes chronic, there is no curative treatment currently. Most children with hepatitis B will have it for the rest of their lives, and about a quarter will experience serious health problems, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago, ACIP and the CDC began to recommend that everyone receive the hepatitis B vaccine when young, eventually moving towards at-birth dosing for the first shot. This strategy was only adopted after previous attempts to just vaccinate the highest-risk groups failed to significantly lower cases. And since its implementation, rates of hepatitis B, especially in children, have steadily fallen in the U.S. The vaccine is also safe, with its most serious side effects, like anaphylaxis, being exceptionally rare and manageable with proper monitoring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting in September, CDC staff argued in support of at-birth vaccination and warned that more children would almost certainly develop hepatitis B if the policy was removed. Both sessions of the ACIP ran long, and at the very last minute—amidst &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03054-z"&gt;lots of confusion&lt;/a&gt; about what the members were actually voting on—the ACIP &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/universal-hepatitis-b-vaccination-at-birth-is-safe-for-now-2000661346"&gt;unexpectedly chose&lt;/a&gt; to table its planned vote on hepatitis B. Given the inclusion of hepatitis B on Friday’s agenda, however, it appears that reprieve was short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The inclusion of the childhood vaccine schedule on Thursday’s agenda is also plenty concerning. Antivaxxers have made no secret about their desire to tear the schedule to shreds if they could. The Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccination group founded by RFK Jr., hosted its “Moment of Truth” conference earlier this month. During the conference, Mark Gorton, president of the MAHA Institute—a group &lt;a href="https://civileats.com/2025/05/16/maha-supporters-form-new-organization-to-boost-rfks-goals-in-d-c/"&gt;founded&lt;/a&gt; to bolster Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy” movement—&lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1989725078050017351"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for the “childhood vaccination schedule to be eliminated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As before, the reformed ACIP has not revealed the contents of its votes scheduled for this next meeting. So it’s still up in the air just how far its members will go in trying to change the schedule. But there’s certainly no reason to be optimistic about what lies ahead for the country’s public health under the reign of RFK Jr.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

That leaves a very narrow view of a complex process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you really want to know how the body adapts during a full week without calories, you need to track many signals at once and see how they change day by day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team launched a study to do exactly that. They tracked how the body reorganized its chemistry across an entire week of fasting, not just on day one and day seven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result reads like a day-by-day log of the body’s priorities as fuel runs low and internal systems adjust, deepening our understanding of how the body responds during extended periods without food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-the-seven-day-fast"&gt;Studying the seven-day fast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Queen Mary’s Precision Healthcare University Research Institute (&lt;a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/phuri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PHURI&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="https://www.nih.no/english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Norwegian School of Sports Sciences&lt;/a&gt; outline a roadmap for future studies that could pave the way for new therapeutic interventions – including options for individuals who cannot fast for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers enrolled twelve healthy adults and supervised them through a seven-day, water-only fast. They collected blood before the fast, every day during it, and again afterward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of checking only glucose or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eggs-and-cholesterol-a-new-twist-in-an-old-debate/"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, they measured about 3,000 proteins over time using proteomics, a method that can detect thousands of circulating molecules at once and capture how they rise or fall across days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This design allowed the team to link specific calendar days of fasting to precise shifts in circulating proteins. Because samples were taken repeatedly, the data show timing, direction, and coordination rather than a single snapshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proteins-change-in-seven-day-fast"&gt;Proteins change in seven-day fast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/proteins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proteins&lt;/a&gt; carry signals, catalyze reactions, form structures, and control activity across tissues. When their levels change together, they can reveal which systems the body is turning up or down. Looking at thousands at once turns the protein catalog into a timeline of events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That timeline shows how metabolism, immune activity, and tissue maintenance respond to zero-calorie conditions. It also shows which adjustments appear early and which arrive only after several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body doesn’t flip into “fasting mode” on day one. Early shifts are scattered and modest. The largest and most coordinated changes in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/blood-proteins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood proteins&lt;/a&gt; appear around day three, with broad reorganization that continues through the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nine-patterns-1-000-changes"&gt;Nine patterns, 1,000 changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because so many proteins were measured, the team grouped them by how they changed over time. They identified nine distinct patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some proteins climbed steadily, some fell quickly and stayed low, and others spiked at specific points before moving back toward baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a thousand proteins changed significantly during the fast. Together, these patterns point to energy conservation, a transition in fuel use, and a push to protect key tissues while energy intake remains at zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A striking signal came from proteins that make up the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2995612/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;extracellular matrix&lt;/a&gt; – the network that surrounds cells and helps maintain tissue structure and cell-to-cell communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these molecules shifted during fasting, indicating that structural and signaling frameworks – not just energy pathways – adjust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One protein, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenascin-R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tenascin-R&lt;/a&gt;, stood out because it is usually discussed in the context of the nervous system. Its change in the blood during fasting raises questions about how a zero-calorie week may affect communication in or around neural tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding does not claim an answer; it sets up testable questions for future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hormones-also-change"&gt;Hormones also change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appetite and fat-storage signals changed in telling ways. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leptin&lt;/a&gt;, produced by fat cells to signal “we have enough energy stored,” dropped as the fast progressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/middle-age-obesity-caused-by-brain-neuron-structure-changes/"&gt;leptin receptor levels&lt;/a&gt; increased in the blood. That combination looks like a shift toward higher sensitivity as the leptin signal weakens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hormone-like proteins changed in directions that aren’t related to storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FGF21 rose, consistent with increased reliance on fat and ketones. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/follistatin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Follistatin&lt;/a&gt;, a protein linked to muscle and metabolic control, increased. Adiponectin tended to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes align with a body that is mobilizing internal reserves rather than storing energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-body-changes-seven-day-fast"&gt;Body changes seven-day fast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tracked physical changes alongside the blood measurements. On average, participants lost about 12.5 pounds (5.7 kilograms) over the week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/10683-dexa-dxa-scan-bone-density-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DXA&lt;/a&gt; (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scans showed shifts in both fat mass and lean tissue, providing a more detailed picture than a simple scale reading can give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also collected urine and measured nitrogen excretion to gauge protein breakdown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the week, nitrogen excretion declined, a sign that the body adjusted how it used and conserved amino acids as fasting continued. In practical terms, the body conserved more protein over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-carbohydrates-to-ketones"&gt;From carbohydrates to ketones&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuel use followed a textbook sequence. In the first day or two of fasting, the body mainly burned through stored &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-refined-carbs-can-make-you-less-attractive/"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;. As the fast continued, reliance on fat and ketones grew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proteomic data aligned with that shift, showing a broad retuning of hormones, immune mediators, and structural proteins that matched the change in fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That coordination matters. It tells us the fuel swap is not a single switch. It is a gradual, coordinated shift across many systems that work together so essential functions keep going while food intake remains at zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-seven-day-fasting-works"&gt;Seven-day fasting works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is not a how-to guide. A seven-day, water-only fast is considered “extreme” and these took place under strict medical supervision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved only twelve people, so we cannot assume the same patterns will hold for everyone. A change in a protein is not automatically good or bad; context matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value here lies in the map. The data show, in fine detail, how the human body reorganizes itself during a week with zero calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy use shifts, but so do tissue structure signals, immune messages, and protein networks tied to long-term disease pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this map on the table, researchers can test strategies that capture helpful parts of the response – like fuel flexibility or specific protein shifts – without asking people to stop eating for an entire week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-024-01008-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 22:14:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNRmwzQTR2NVo1ZGpkUGJSUTNsRzN5QnVUdlJhUUtESWRtNkxkSDY4TkNnMnp1b0JYZlBNLWl3Z0FKXzJPRXZKX1d2Sno3NHBqSmppaUxXSEJvc0pCOGwtM0xPZkVMZld2VndRYkluNEF0b09mVUhNMFg4bWhYNmplZUdfbkRubUZDWUc4cWVsNHJPdXhtaG1vZEEzM0g4NER2QkV4alpRZkJRODg</guid></item><item><title>美国的资金削减危及全球消除宫颈癌的努力- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/17/health/cervical-cancer-hpv-vaccine-gavi-funding</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;span class="editor-note__prefix vossi-editor-note_elevate__prefix"&gt;EDITOR’S NOTE:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;em&gt;This story was reported in collaboration with the Global Health Reporting Center with support from the Pulitzer Center.&lt;/em&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3isyy0002r27qne6k48lhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maina Modu, an immunization officer in Nigeria’s northeastern Borno state, lost his wife, Hauwa, to cervical cancer in 2011. She was one of the 349,000 women globally who die from the preventable cancer every year. Thirteen years later, he jumped at the chance to protect his family and community from undergoing such loss again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3n5vgf00013b6qatfko3w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May 2024, Modu helped launch Borno’s first immunization campaign to vaccinate adolescent girls against human papillomavirus (HPV), the pathogen that causes nearly all cervical cancers. And he made sure two of his daughters, including the youngest child of his late wife, were among the first to be protected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c00073b6q70u03otl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “More than any other person, I was so excited when I heard about the vaccine,” said Modu, who has 10 children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c00083b6qhiqiwpgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was so happy that they were safe,” he said. “It reminds me of the lost glory of my wife.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c00093b6qmw0a5jk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His daughters were among 86 million girls vaccinated as part of a campaign led by Gavi, a public-private partnership that works with government health systems in lower-income countries to protect children and adolescents against&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;more than 20 infectious diseases. Seventy-three million of those girls were vaccinated in just the past three years, most of them in Africa and Asia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000a3b6qsstulux5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Its HPV vaccination program is a key piece of the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240014107" target="_blank"&gt;global strategy&lt;/a&gt; to put cervical cancer on a path to elimination, following diseases like measles, polio and smallpox. But the pace of its progress against HPV and cervical cancer is now under threat after unexpected funding cuts by the US government.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000b3b6qvtmuhtcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gavi set an ambitious target to dramatically scale up its HPV vaccine program in 2023. On Monday, the organization announced that it had met its goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000c3b6qpeyc6mwu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Thanks to incredible commitment from countries, partners, civil society and communities, we have now reached that target ahead of schedule,” said Dr. Sania Nishtar, Gavi’s CEO. “This collaborative effort is driving major global progress towards eliminating one of the deadliest diseases affecting women.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000d3b6q7dgh7z4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the celebration is taking place under a heavy shadow. In June, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stunned health officials when, in a video address to world leaders gathered to pledge funding to Gavi, he said the US was pulling all financial support until the organization could “re-earn the public’s trust.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000e3b6q9zlu4yw7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist who has repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/kennedy-vaccine-strategy-manufacturers"&gt;targeted the US vaccine system&lt;/a&gt; since taking office, praised Gavi’s commitment to “making medicine affordable to all the world’s people” but criticized&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;its messaging about vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as Gavi’s handling of vaccine safety issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000f3b6qy0hnfr2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gavi issued a &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/statement-response-25-june-2025" target="_blank"&gt;detailed statement&lt;/a&gt; in response to Kennedy’s claims, defending its commitment to children’s health and use of independent WHO experts, noting that it “remains committed to continuing an evidence-based and scientific approach to its work and investment decisions, as it always has done.” It has continued to engage with the US government on restoring funding in the months since, a spokesperson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000g3b6q12aa8o5a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gavi’s budget comes from national governments and private funders, including philanthropies, corporations and individual donors, with the US having been – until recently – one of its largest supporters. Since its founding in 2000, the organization has helped immunize over 1.2 billion children in 78 lower-income countries, efforts that have prevented an estimated 20.6 million deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000h3b6qv7rsmeku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No country had ever withdrawn a financial commitment to Gavi, according to the organization. The US provided about 13% of its funding. If that isn’t restored, combined with other reduced pledges, Gavi will be left with a nearly $3 billion shortfall – approximately a quarter of its expected budget. That could force a significant scaling back of the anti-cancer campaign when Gavi’s board meets next month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3mxai000003b6qa6kdeasd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HPV vaccination remains a top priority for Gavi, a spokesperson said, but financial pressure might affect how it expands coverage. “Difficult decisions will need to be made on deploying resources to areas of highest health impact.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000j3b6qwst98mrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to questions about its stance on Gavi, HHS referred to its statement issued when Kennedy announced the pause in funding, which said “the concern is that when vaccine safety issues have come before GAVI, it has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000k3b6q2n4qijgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency did not address questions about what specifically&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Gavi can do to re-earn public trust in the eyes of the US government.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iw58c000l3b6qmmvon52o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The millions of HPV vaccines Gavi has given will save lives, said Dr. Robert Bednarczyk, an associate professor of global health at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health. “But there’s going to be new children and adolescents that are going to be eligible to get vaccinated every year. And having cuts to Gavi’s support is potentially going to reduce the access to vaccines in these settings.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3itf8300003b6qhxusttxk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HPV vaccines protect against a family of viruses that cause 4% of cancers globally, the most common of which is cervical cancer, the fourth deadliest cancer for women. Depending on the formulation of the vaccine, they prevent infections that cause between 70% and 90% of all cervical cancer cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwyx4000t3b6qvwiaf4sc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a remarkable vaccine,” said Dr. Jessica Kahn, professor of pediatrics and senior associate dean of clinical and translational research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who noted that it also prevents infections that cause anal, vaginal, vulvar, and head and neck cancers. “It has the potential to have a truly transformative impact on cancers around the world.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwyx4000u3b6qc0j8udx3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Introduced in 2006, the vaccine is only the second widely used vaccine that prevents cancer; the other prevents hepatitis B infections, a major cause of liver cancer. The HPV vaccine is typically given before the beginning of sexual activity, generally recommended for girls ages 9 to 14 in a two- or three-dose regimen. Its dramatic impact is becoming more obvious as the first women to receive the vaccine reach their 30s, 40s and 50s, when cervical cancer typically appears.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwyx4000v3b6qe8nl2oo7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The HPV vaccine is probably one of the most effective vaccines that we have out there, and we’re constantly getting new data in on that, as the vaccine has been used for a longer period of time,” said Bednarczyk, who studies HPV vaccination. “The research really shows us that we have a very, very good tool for reducing the amount of cervical cancer and really decreasing that burden globally.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwyx4000w3b6q67vdt5iv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But for years, the vaccine was mostly available in wealthy countries, such as the United States and European nations. Further decreasing the cervical cancer burden means vaccinating school-age girls in places where cases and deaths are highest: low- and middle-income countries, the majority of them in sub-Saharan Africa. That requires a lot of investment, Bednarczyk says. “HPV vaccines are some of the more expensive vaccines that we have out there. That’s really where Gavi comes in.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwyx4000x3b6qzfwtasgw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the 2010s, Gavi began piloting school-based vaccination programs. But demand soon outpaced HPV vaccine supply, leading to shortages. The organization spent years negotiating purchasing agreements with vaccine manufacturers on behalf of the 57 lower-income countries it supports.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwyx4000y3b6qzvx3ysmq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All the pieces were in place at the end of 2022, when a big opportunity arose to reduce cost and simplify the HPV vaccination process: WHO issued guidance that said a single dose of the vaccine confers effective protection. Gavi was ready, said Emily Kobayashi, head of Gavi’s HPV Vaccines Programme.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwyx4000z3b6qnttyb5k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That single-dose recommendation from WHO, based on the building evidence, meant that the supply we had could go much further,” she said. “And it was easier to deliver the vaccine to girls once, rather than having to track them down and give them their second or third dose.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwyx400103b6qr4ux45f1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gavi quickly directed $600 million to the “revitalisation” of its HPV vaccination program, supporting countries on vaccine acquisition, investments in health systems to improve HPV vaccine delivery, and integrating HPV vaccination into routine immunisation. In 2023 alone, it helped vaccinate 14 million girls – more than in the previous eight years combined.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iwx5j000r3b6qvpfok9nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nigeria, Modu’s home, was one of the first countries to launch a single-dose HPV immunization program with Gavi. The most populous country in Africa, Nigeria has a cervical cancer rate that’s four times higher than in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ixr0l00173b6qc40f6xvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was amazed when the federal government announced the introduction of HPV into immunization,” Modu said. “I mobilized my community together – my family and everybody to receive this vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ixr0l00183b6qoxmx8y5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since 2023, the country has immunized more than 13 million girls, the largest share of Gavi’s 86 million total. Nigeria is among 49 countries that have introduced HPV vaccination with Gavi support. Another seven are on track to launch programs before mid-2026, according to the organization, some of them before the end of 2025.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ixr0l00193b6qb0pdmmyk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By January, Gavi estimates that HPV vaccines will be available in countries that have 89% of the world’s cervical cancer burden, up from 10% a decade ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ixr0l001b3b6qvekoen2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is definitely a game-changer for HPV vaccination and access to the HPV vaccine,” Kobayashi said. “Cervical cancer is one of the most painful and undignified ways to die, and it’s almost completely preventable by one shot in childhood. … It’s going from a vaccine that’s only available in a small number of places to something that’s widely available, including in lower-income countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ixr0l001c3b6qes55m4kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gavi’s current plans call for more than doubling the number of girls it has vaccinated against HPV in the next five years and continuing to expand access to more countries with high rates of cervical cancer. The goal is to vaccinate 120 million girls from 2026 to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;2030. The organization spent the past year appealing to donors to fully fund its campaign to do so, which it estimates would save 1.5 million lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3ixpt000153b6qfi9adknb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in the wake of Kennedy’s stunning announcement, these ambitious goals are now in question.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001j3b6qdau1a0y5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gavi plans its work on five-year cycles, securing pledges from its major funders in advance. Since the organization was founded, the US has been among the largest funders, exceeded only by the United Kingdom and the Gates Foundation. During the Biden administration, it pledged $1.58 billion to Gavi for 2025-30, what was set to be its largest contribution yet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001k3b6qvj515y04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            US commitments to Gavi were uninterrupted during the first Trump administration, with Trump recommitting the US pledge in 2020, but things were different almost immediately when the new administration began this year. Funding for Gavi was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank"&gt;abruptly paused&lt;/a&gt; during the dismantling of the US Agency for International Development and remains in limbo.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001l3b6q7cb4ui9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We continue to engage with the U.S. and hope we can sustain the strong partnership that has endured since Gavi’s founding,” the Gavi spokesperson said. “While we have incredible bipartisan support in Congress and across U.S. Administrations, including President Trump’s robust pledge at the 2020 replenishment, this is the first time we’ve seen a committed pledge walked back.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001m3b6qxj9t2geh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the executive branch makes the country’s financial pledges to the organization, it’s Congress that sets the annual funding level to be distributed to Gavi. For the 2026 fiscal year, a House committee approved $300 million for Gavi, while its Senate counterpart has not yet released a State and Foreign appropriations bill. Meanwhile, Gavi has not received the $300 million Congress appropriated in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001n3b6qr6gobayn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a response to questions about who would make the ultimate decision about releasing allocated funds, a State Department spokesperson said in an email, “The U.S. government speaks with one voice for all America First foreign policy programming,” adding that “The State Department collaborates closely with [other agencies] to implement assistance consistent with Trump Administration priorities. … The State Department has notified Gavi that the American taxpayer’s money must deliver better on the United States’ global health goals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy’s announcement came on the heels of other Trump administration shakeups pulling back from global health initiatives, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/19/us/trump-who-funding-threat-explainer-intl/"&gt;withdrawing from WHO &lt;/a&gt;and dismantling the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/01/politics/us-aid-elimination-study-14-million-deaths"&gt;US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As those shakeups reverberated across the global health field, Gavi saw other funders partially scale back expected contributions. And vaccine experts worry that US actions will not just limit budgets but erode trust in vaccines as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001q3b6qpdisnqhx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s long history of criticizing vaccine programs – often with false and misleading claims – includes helping organize &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/kennedy-played-key-role-vaccine-case-against-merck-2025-01-18/" target="_blank"&gt;a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the makers of Gardasil, the first HPV vaccine, alleging that drugmaker&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Merck overstated its safety (Merck has previously said the litigation has no merit). The potential fees Kennedy would collect from the case while in office became a point of contention in his confirmation hearing, before he ultimately said he would &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-kennedy-health-secretary-ethics-390e47ac1dd11aeef954851a9a5358ac" target="_blank"&gt;divest from the case.&lt;/a&gt; The next month, the parties agreed to&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/merck-vaccine-case-linked-hhs-secretary-kennedy-delayed-company-says-2025-02-18/" target="_blank"&gt; postpone the case&lt;/a&gt; until February 2026.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001r3b6qeykyjvmi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a separate legal action in March, a federal judge ruled in Merck’s favor, dismissing more than 200 cases that similarly challenged the safety of the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001s3b6q4r2mbob0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are headwinds there because of vaccine disinformation and misinformation,” said Kahn, who has served on the WHO HPV Vaccine Advisory Committee and has been studying HPV vaccine effectiveness since 2006. “But this is one of the safest vaccines ever tested,” she said, citing more than 100 safety studies of 2.5 million people in six countries, which have shown no serious side effects of HPV vaccination beyond the rare allergic reactions typical for all vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001t3b6qewhtu305@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we wanted to eliminate cervical cancer globally, we could,” said Kahn, who considers the WHO cervical cancer goals ambitious but “achievable with the right political will.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001u3b6q65s06t4w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those goals set a target of 90% of girls under 15 vaccinated against HPV by 2030, along with screening and treatment targets for adult women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001v3b6qgycnk1ha@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve got these tools, we’ve got these systems to be able to prevent these cancers, but we actually need to be able to use them. And to use them, we need these concerted efforts to make sure that there is good and equitable access to these vaccines,” Bednarczyk said. “So all of these missed opportunities that we have today due to these funding cuts are potentially leaving generations of individuals more susceptible to these cancers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001w3b6qvp2mieph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A few countries, including the Netherlands, Brazil and Hungary, have increased financial commitments to Gavi in recent months, and the organization expects to announce several others by the end of the year. But those contributions so far total less than $200 million of the nearly $3 billion budget hole. Gavi’s leadership will be making decisions on how to use the funding it does have at a board meeting in December and finalizing them by the summer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001x3b6q0vdu5mxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our leadership and Board are looking at ways in which cuts can be applied to Gavi programmes while having as little impact as possible on children’s health. At the same time, Gavi continues to fundraise,” the spokesperson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001y3b6qbe3kidoj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The organization will continue to support countries in the process of launching HPV vaccination programs, some using remaining 2025 funds, and those now doing routine HPV vaccination, like Nigeria. As girls there reach their 9th birthdays, they’ll be able to get Gavi-supplied vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z001z3b6qlld5n2ec@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those include two more of Maina Modu’s children. Modu retired from his immunization officer job last month at age 56 but continues to campaign for cervical cancer vaccination, sharing his family’s story to encourage members of his community to vaccinate their daughters.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z00203b6qnnswqit9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Cervical cancer is a very dangerous and killer disease, and I learned that from my late wife,” he said. “That’s what makes me take it upon myself to make sure that I immunize them and ask others to emulate this.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmi3iyg4z00213b6qyb6pn13j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another of Maina Modu’s daughters turns 9 in January. He plans to take her straight to their local health clinic for her HPV vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at Indiana University have announced that they developed a molecular test that can simultaneously detect three major disease-causing fungi much faster than traditional methods, speeding treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1103652"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was presented at the recent Association for Molecular Pathology 2025 Annual Meeting and Expo in Boston.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coccidioidomycosis, which are often linked to contaminated soil, occur in different parts of the United States. Because they are often mistaken for other respiratory illnesses, correct diagnosis of the potentially life-threatening infections remains low, which delays treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test directly targets genetic regions unique to each fungus, bypassing the slow culture process that is complicated by the fungi’s ability to switch between environmental and human forms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compared with standard methods, the PCR test identified all samples with 100% accuracy. In addition, it was 100% specific, meaning that it didn't mistakenly flag other fungi or contaminants. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our assay has the potential to significantly improve turnaround time and diagnostic confidence for infections that have historically been difficult to detect quickly," Kenneth Gavina, PhD, who oversaw the project, said in the AMP news release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could fill 'major gap' in fungal diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histoplasmosis, which is most common in the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys, usually presents as a lung infection in patients who have inhaled soil containing bird or bat droppings. Blastomycosis, which occurs mainly in the central and southeastern United States, also presents as a lung infection but can spread to bones, skin, and other organs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clinicians currently have no FDA [US Food and Drug Administration]–approved molecular tests for these three pathogens, making rapid, reliable detection a pressing need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coccidioidomycosis, or valley fever, typically causes mild infection but can lead to severe pneumonia or infection elsewhere in the body. It is seen primarily in southwestern states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"While additional clinical validation is under way, this assay shows strong potential to fill a major gap in fungal diagnostics," Gavina said. "Clinicians currently have no FDA [US Food and Drug Administration]–approved molecular tests for these three pathogens, making rapid, reliable detection a pressing need."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Packed with antioxidants, anti-inflammatory compounds, and potent plant polyphenols, it helps protect brain cells from damage, supports sharper memory, and may slow processes linked to cognitive decline. These compounds play a key role in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, two major contributors to ageing and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. As people increasingly turn to natural ways to support long-term brain function, pomegranate stands out as a powerful, nutrient-rich fruit that helps nourish and protect the mind throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How pomegranate protects your brain from ageing and memory decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pomegranate is exceptionally rich in polyphenols such as punicalagins, ellagic acid, and anthocyanins. These compounds help reduce oxidative stress, a major driver behind ageing, memory loss, and neurodegenerative conditions.

Compounds in pomegranate appear to influence these pathways positively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helps protect neurons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pomegranate’s polyphenols help shield brain cells from toxins and stress that can contribute to Alzheimer’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;b&gt;May reduce amyloid and tau accumulation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that certain compounds in pomegranate may help reduce the build-up of harmful proteins associated with Alzheimer’s. By supporting healthier signalling in the brain, pomegranate may slow processes that trigger memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boosts memory activity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies involving pomegranate juice show improved memory performance and increased activity in brain regions responsible for learning and recall. Regular intake may support clearer thinking and stronger long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supports the brain’s detox and repair processes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By reducing oxidative damage and enhancing cellular resilience, pomegranate may help the brain maintain healthier tissue and slow cognitive ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to add pomegranate to your diet for brain health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating pomegranate into your daily routine is simple and enjoyable. Here are the most effective ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Drink pure pomegranate juice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small daily glass of 100% pomegranate juice can provide a concentrated dose of antioxidants. Choose unsweetened, cold-pressed juice for maximum benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Eat fresh pomegranate seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding the seeds (arils) to yoghurt, salads, porridge, or snacks provides fibre, vitamins, and the full spectrum of brain-supporting antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Use pomegranate extract supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardised pomegranate extract capsules offer higher concentrations of polyphenols for those who may not consume the fruit regularly. Always choose reputable brands and consult a professional if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Try pomegranate seed oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pomegranate seed oil is rich in punicic acid, which may support cellular health. It is typically consumed in small quantities or used as a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Additional lifestyle tips for strong brain health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pomegranate offers powerful benefits, combining it with healthy habits makes a bigger impact:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep 7-8 hours each night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay mentally active through reading, puzzles, or learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise regularly to improve circulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce high sugar or processed food intake&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these habits support sharper memory and long-term brain vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Precautions to keep in mind&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pomegranate is generally safe, but consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you take medications (especially for blood pressure or cholesterol), check with a healthcare professional.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose natural, unsweetened products to avoid added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start with small amounts if you’ve never consumed pomegranate before.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;Among the world’s manifold disease burdens, antibiotic resistant bacteria hold a special place of concern. But recent evidence points to the malaria parasite &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61820-0/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;also developing&lt;/a&gt; resistance to drugs that have been working to killed it off for the last quarter-century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, news that a major drug trial looking at the efficacy of a new-class of antimalarial medication called KLU156 found it was just as reliable as exiting treatments will come as a major sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing frontline malaria medication is based on a plant-extract from sweet wormwood called artemisinin, combined with other compounds. The resulting ACT (Artemisinin-based combination therapies), has been recommended as an antimalarial medication since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its discovery yielded Chinese scientist Tu Youyou, who synthesized artemisinin from sweet wormwood in the 1970s, a Nobel Prize in 2015. It also forever fortified the notion that traditional Chinese medicine maintains value in the modern age, as it was this herbal, astrological practice that prescribed sweet wormwood as a fever treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new compound was identified by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis, which rather than combing the annals of traditional Alpine medicine, used sophisticated computing to analyze some 2 million different pharmaceutical compounds for their antimalarial potential. The result was ganaplacide, which was combined with lumefantrine, the partner drug in ACTs, to create KLU156.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KLU 156 cured malaria in 99.2% of cases in a study of 1,600 people from 12 different African countries, compared to 96.7% of those who were treated with lumefantrine alone. One might consider that difference insubstantial, but when over half a million people die in Africa alone of malaria every year, that 2.5% is anything but.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a new compound that is not artemisinin-based, and that is that effective and safe, is really music to my ears,” said study team member Abdoulaye Djimdé, a malaria researcher at the University of Sciences Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Mali, at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into KLU156’s effects demonstrated that not only did it kill malarial parasites faster, but the reproductive stage of the parasite that’s picked up by mosquitoes when they feed on humans, meaning the drug may aid in transmission interruption as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE MALARIAL TREATMENT OPTIONS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="‘Cheaper, More Humane’ Drones Emerge as Key Weapon in Mosquito Control from Poland to Africa" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cheaper-more-humane-drones-emerge-as-key-weapon-in-mosquito-control-from-poland-to-africa/" rel="bookmark"&gt;‘Cheaper, More Humane’ Drones Emerge as Key Weapon in Mosquito Control from Poland to Africa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taste, however, is dire, and caused 20% more instances of vomiting, leading to 10-times as many interruptions of treatment. Work is ongoing to discover how to mask the taste of the powder that has to be dissolved in water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis has said it will look to get the drug approved as fast as possible, before marketing it at cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even once that occurs, debate is ongoing over when to use it. With antibiotics, new drug options are often kept on the shelves until it’s clear existing treatments are failing. Some researchers say that KLU156 can’t afford to be withheld because lumefantrine is a partner drug for both ACTs and KLU156.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUCCESS IN AFRICA: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="First African Nation to Eliminate River Blindness Treated Millions with Ivermectin to Achieve Great Success" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-african-nation-to-eliminate-river-blindness-treated-millions-with-ivermectin-to-achieve-great-success/" rel="bookmark"&gt;First African Nation to Eliminate River Blindness Treated Millions with Ivermectin to Achieve Great Success&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax &lt;/em&gt;have already developed resistance to artemisinin, and it’s feared that because more malarial cells are surviving in the body for longer, the template is there for it to quickly develop resistance to lumefantrine. If that happened, the efficacy of KLU156 would be dampened even before any benefit was received.&lt;/p&gt;

In serious cases, patients develop haemorrhaging from the nose, gums and internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopian authorities first detected the virus on Wednesday in the Jinka area after receiving alerts about a suspected hemorrhagic illness. Officials tested 17 individuals, identifying at least nine infections before confirming the initial deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daba said that work is progressing to bring the outbreak under control quickly through a coordinated national response. The government has activated emergency response centres at multiple levels and deployed rapid response teams to affected areas, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian minister added that no active symptomatic cases are currently being treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethiopia has established its own laboratory testing capacity for Marburg at the national public health institute, allowing authorities to conduct diagnostics independently rather than relying solely on external support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minister urged anyone experiencing symptoms to seek immediate medical testing at health facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International health teams from the World Health Organization and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have arrived to support containment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry has also launched a public awareness &lt;a href="https://x.com/FMoHealth/status/1990334086637068734" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;, distributing infographics in Amharic detailing symptoms and prevention measures, and establishing a hotline for reporting suspected cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marburg spreads through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus kills roughly half of those infected on average, though mortality rates have climbed as high as 88 percent in previous outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/marburg-virus-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to WHO data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN health agency warns that health workers are especially vulnerable to being infected by the virus “through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practised”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ethiopian outbreak extends a troubling pattern of haemorrhagic fever emergencies across East Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Marburg outbreak in Tanzania claimed 10 lives between January and March this year, while Rwanda ended its first recorded Marburg outbreak last December, with 15 people killed by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rwanda tested an experimental vaccine during its outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa CDC Director-General Jean Kaseya expressed particular concern about potential spillover into South Sudan, citing the country’s weak healthcare infrastructure as a major vulnerability in containing cross-border transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 18:07:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>从不可战胜到不可阻挡：新的癌症治疗靶点出现-加州大学旧金山分校</title><link>https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/11/431086/undruggable-unstoppable-new-cancer-cure-target-emerges</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_narrow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly a quarter of all cancerous tumors are caused by mutations in the KRAS gene, which fosters cell growth. For more than three decades, scientists believed these mutations were impervious to treatment. Today, National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded discoveries by UC San Francisco Professor of Cellular Molecular Pharmacology &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kevan.shokat"&gt;Kevan Shokat, PhD&lt;/a&gt; have produced the world’s first drugs that target KRAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="eyebrow-title"&gt;What they found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KRAS gene is present in nearly all of our cells and provides the blueprint for a protein called K-Ras that helps signal to cells to divide and grow. Some mutations in the KRAS gene cause this signal to get stuck in the "on" position and cells divide uncontrollably, while additional mutations occur to create cancerous tumors. Some of the deadliest cancers are the result, including lung, pancreatic, and colorectal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Shokat and his team became the first to discover a tiny “pocket” on the mutated K-Ras’ surface that would finally prove to be the protein’s Achilles’ heel. Shokat’s lab developed drugs that could snuggle into the pocket and bind to the protein, weakening and killing the cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="eyebrow-title"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shokat and his team at UCSF proved the K-Ras protein was “druggable” and could be targeted with medicine. Their discovery and subsequent drug development led the Food and Drug Administration to recently approve the world’s first two KRAS-targeting cancer treatments, sotorasib and adagrasib. Similar treatments are now in late-stage clinical trials, ushering in a new era in cancer treatment. The work has also inspired Shokat and others to explore new ways to target enzymes whose dysfunction can lead to Parkinson’s and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;dom-twocolumn-layout class="ck-widget" data-column1-size="50" data-column2-size="50" data-column1-color="transparent" data-column2-color="transparent" contenteditable="false" data-layout="50-50"&gt;&lt;div class="column2" slot="column2"&gt;&lt;h3 class="small-title"&gt;Saving Lives with Science&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="null"&gt;UCSF scientists discover treatments for the most heartbreaking and costly diseases, pioneer new industries, create jobs, and safeguard America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="button" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/saving-lives-with-science" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8bdddc7e-6f57-4629-9db4-60a37e86a6f5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Saving Lives with Science"&gt;See how our research saves lives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/dom-twocolumn-layout&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the study looked into how the cells responsible for the pigments in our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/tags/hair"&gt;hair&lt;/a&gt; and skin ‘self-destruct’ when damaged, as part of our body’s efforts to protect us from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/tags/cancer"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that, under specific types of damage, these pigment-producing cells simply shut themselves down instead of continuing to divide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That choice prevents faulty cells from spreading dangerous mutations – but over time, it also means fewer pigment-making cells remain, causing hair to turn grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long explored ways to stop pigment cells from self-destructing in an attempt to prevent greying, but the new findings suggest your greys are a sign of an important anti-cancer defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/11/Purple-GettyImages-1486775339.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="a Double helix broken in half" class="wp-image-209403"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Damaged DNA can develop mutations, which lead to cancer - Credit: Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[This study] reframes hair greying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses,” said Prof Emi Nishimura from the University of Tokyo, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo team made the discovery while studying melanocyte stem cells in mice – the cells that normally produce hair pigment. They found these melanocyte cells only sacrificed themselves when their DNA experienced a ‘double-strand break’, essentially a clean snap through both sides of the DNA helix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the cells were exposed to other kinds of stress, such as ultraviolet light or carcinogens, they didn’t self-destruct. Instead, they survived and kept dividing, allowing mutations to build up and potentially laying the groundwork for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This two-track response – cells sacrificing themselves in some scenarios but clinging on in others – could help reveal why grey hair and skin cancers both become more frequent with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that understanding – and eventually controlling – this response could open the door to new ways of eliminating high-risk cells before they become cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;
