There were weightlifters and their murky shakes spiked with GNC powder, then the carb-shunning South Beach-ers of the early aughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2TSCO5LNABDHVO5BBVFSI4PQLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But these days, it’s not just the protein-maxing, macro-counting gym bros espousing their lust for the stuff. At some point, protein became the shibboleth for the suddenly trendy menopausal and perimenopausal set, along with power-walking in weighted vests. The MAGA movement, which &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/03/13/steak-shake-maga-beef-tallow/" target="_blank"&gt;touts beef tallow&lt;/a&gt; and red meat, is on board. Wellness influencers laud it for building strength and curbing appetites, while often overlooking the fact most of these products marketed as health foods qualify as the kind of ultra-processed fare we’re told to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DV4N4MIAIBDBTJZZ5QVVRVPKSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Acolytes are not just content to house chicken breasts and hard-boiled eggs and beef jerky. Everything, it seems, is getting protein-ified — even &lt;a href="https://store.orawellness.com/products/orawellness-smile-hydroxyapatite-toothpaste-paleo-cinnamony-mint?srsltid=AfmBOopbramT9xdIPxZkzJN71PRA5S94rJMRY3oYZBv6qchwbhP39Q-8" target="_blank"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt;, is case you want gums that are swole, not swollen. Never mind that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2025/01/02/how-much-protein-do-you-need/" target="_blank"&gt;most Americans are already eating the recommended amount of protein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QJQSG5RGZHADE4PMD4ZWNXHQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How much is enough? The federal recommended dietary allowance is 0.8 grams daily per kilogram of body weight, which is about 54 grams of protein for a person weighing 150 pounds. But that is the minimum. For active people, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;experts recommend between 1 to 1.2 grams per kilogram&lt;/a&gt; and even up to double the daily minimum. For athletes, some researchers recommend more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6XQYSR6UEVANLB5CGGBLUAYT54" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No matter, food companies eager to capitalize on the collective hunger for protein are packing it into just about everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCMRY6MCDBHRPGS4UMGCF4ADLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You could, I noted to an editor, spend a day eat nothing but protein-boosted food, which is how I would end up with an assignment to do just that. (Perhaps this will teach me to keep such observations to myself.) With my mission set, I first went shopping, and found it easy to fill up a cart. The day was heavy on snacks since many of the popular products are designed for on-the-go eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RS3PRRTZ7RADZAF6TCYRJUBQZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In my account below, I’ve noted the protein contained in one serving of each item I tried, although I did not finish a full serving of each. I wanted to survive the full day, after all. Here’s how my day of eating like a fruit-fearing amino acid freak went down:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U4IEWVGFBFG4LE2RXM3OGTQ23I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wheaties Protein (29 g protein per serving: 21 g from the cereal; 8 g from ¾ cup whole milk)&lt;/b&gt;: I started off like a champion — with a bowl of Wheaties. The company has always associated itself with athletes, so its new protein-packed flavors seem quite on-brand. I tried the honey pecan variety, whose sweetener gave the traditional flakes a strange texture, rendering them sticky and not crunchy. The cloying fake vanilla flavor wasn’t doing them any favors either, although I appreciated that at least some of the cereal’s protein came not just from soy protein isolate but from pecans and sunflower seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QGPTBBNZJBET3JDEXMS4TWDDQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legendary Foods Strawberry Protein Pastry (20 g protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; If you’re more of a Pop-Tart person, there’s a jacked-up breakfast for you — this sure looks like dupe for the nostalgic treat, with its confetti-flecked icing topping. A protein blend of calcium caseinate, micellar casein (both derived from dairy) and whey protein isolates were the first ingredients on a list that included a litany of unappealing lab-wizardry, from sugar substitutes erythritol and sucralose to Yellows No. 1 and 5. This Mock Tart tasted as fake as one might suspect, even after a warmup in the microwave that the wrapper promised would give me a “next level experience.” Honestly, I’d rather eat the grocery bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JWRKXQ4U6VDFBBCYAGBGZPI44A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ready Protein Water (20 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;Of course there is such a thing as protein water, a product that caused me to ask a question I never expected to mull: Can water feel slimy? The answer, it turns out, is yes! This drink was viscous and flavored with cherry, giving it both the mouthfeel and taste of cough syrup. Alas, it lingered long after I had managed to gulp it down, leaving behind a tooth-coating stevia sweetness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5JAAMYIGC5CMRCHOHRVP72SPTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Khloud Protein Popcorn (7 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;My midmorning snack was the most high-profile of the lineup. The brand fronted by reality royalty Khloé Kardashian, promises “Good stuff zero fluff,” and after my last science experiment of a snack, the simple, easily pronounceable ingredients (popcorn, milk protein isolate, cane sugar, olive oil, coconut milk and mineral salt) were welcome. I would have preferred the white cheddar flavor, but my local market only had the sweet and salty kettle corn style in stock, so that’s what I went with. The kernels had a nice sweet-salt balance and no off flavors, but they felt a little stale, and the powdery dust covering them was chalky. Still, unlike nearly all of the other bites I tried on this fateful day, I actually went back for a second handful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TZBGFW3KARCGVFSO45W4ATFKCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barilla’s Protein+ pasta (10 g of protein per serving) and Chad &amp;amp; Barney’s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sturdy Sauce (20 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;For lunch, a bowl of pasta awaited — but not anything your nonna would recognize. The penne got some heft from pea protein and chickpea flour, and the marinara was bulked up with something called “hydrolyzed bovine collagen.” The pasta itself was passable, if a tad gummy. But the bitter, astringent sauce tasted like licking a can of sour tomatoes. I was halfway through the day and already ready to quit — protein is supposed to help you get stronger, but my will to finish this project was suddenly feeling quite feeble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YKI5R2WZ5A33GVNXPWQFRRL2A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redefine Foods’ oatmeal protein pie (15 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;Later in the afternoon, I sampled a trio of peanut-powered products. First up was a sandwich of soft chocolate disks and a filling made with what I assumed was Skippy brand peanut butter. But when I examined the packaging, I noticed that nowhere was the phrase “peanut butter” actually used, and that underneath the large font used to tout the “chocolate” was the smaller modifier “flavored.” As it turned out, there wasn’t much of the promised flavoring, and I’m not sure I would have known the pie was chocolate if I didn’t have the visual cue and the packaging to tell me. The filling itself was fine at first bite, but I quickly got that suspiciously cloying note — and another glance at the wrapper revealed the culprit: stevia, my nemesis of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWI2KDWCWNGXHPNWZTJ4VOZDD4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;One Reese’s Peanut Butter Lovers Flavored Protein Bar (18 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; Another giant of the peanut butter space, Reese’s, is half of the collab with protein-bar maker One. I sighed when I spotted yet more low-calorie sweeteners — this bar includes maltitol, a sugar alcohol; and isomalto-oligosaccharides, which are derived from starch — that gives this bar the feeling of a Franken-candy. It was chewy, gritty and brought to mind stale taffy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPYT75G3RRFZBJCVFZVGPXSSCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lenny &amp;amp; Larry’s Complete Cookie (8 g of protein per serving): &lt;/b&gt;This soft-baked cookie&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;with peanut butter and chocolate chip earned the dubious distinction of being my least-loathed of the three, with a chewy texture and more natural flavor. But if you’re in the game for protein, this cookie might be a bit misleading: The packaging says it contains 16 grams, but an examination of the nutritional label clarifies that the single cookie comprises two servings, meaning each serving contains only 8 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K3APAVLIUFCGPMNNVAOB74KGSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quest protein chips (19 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; A combo of crispy snacks awaited me later. I was excited (well, as jazzed as I could be after the day’s onslaught) by the Quest tortilla-style chips in the ranch flavor, which some fans have hyped on social media as a substitute for Cool Ranch Doritos, my guilty pleasure of a road-trip snack. They were, alas, a pale shadow of that classic chip, with a one-note tang and a texture I found oddly … sandy? And really, people — more stevia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4UTNMHYWCNB6PID6VYUZN3RHUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lenny &amp;amp; Larry’s Fitzels (7 g of protein per serving):&lt;/b&gt; This snack, a play on “pretzels” and … “fitness,” probably, offered more potential for misunderstanding. The packaging notes that there are 20 grams of protein per bag, but again, you have to read the fine print to glean that there are three servings in the small pouch. The “cinnamon bun” flavor had a nice bakery-like scent, but they didn’t have the same snap as real pretzels (perhaps due to the addition of pea protein). Still, I felt like I was ending the day on a relatively high note, because I didn’t want to actually throw this snack across the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SIQCMIZB4ZEB3LJR3PXLF644WY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My day of protein-packed eating was, mercifully, over. I finished the marathon feeling a bit wiser (if more than a little nauseous): It seems that the world of protein-enhanced products is laden with so many highly processed ingredients. Shoppers should scour those ingredient labels carefully. And maybe not everything needs to be “health” food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEG4YGUP4NAPZNF2BAE4OR272E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I planned to skip dinner, probably. Or maybe just nibble on (gasp!) a carrot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:32:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPTG91Q2RndTcxTDdvN0YtV2xRS00tRWx6T3NjeUxoa2h0MTV2ZFNxOE5KVXNjZlZ1VTZiUzc5MXloMGNUS3hfTzJSQU04MDRKMkhWQWVrN1F5UHJSbkZkTmpiMWluUG5obXhBamhCRVozdEExNWlwbTV6eWp5RHJzNUJVdUxkdW01WlVR</guid></item><item><title>什么是基孔肯雅热，这种病毒现在在中国南方蔓延？ - ABC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPOVNyamx2dWhxYW1rQzNvRkhxWXduMDA0SkcwN1Y3VTQwemFSTHlxU050NHc4YXJBZHI5aExxelJDN3dUQk5iMjl4dzNveFhIeTVJMzRqSy0zXzRRM0haXzg0SUU3bUp0bWZWa09MYUQ2ZUhnNmktX0JCd21tQjhZZlltX0RZZUEzRHBjeVRYRWxCTFRUQVVTR3JsVlRmUDNrd1JhMWZn0gGrAUFVX3lxTE8tZkRDN1lEcU5OV1o3b3JlUGRQWS1zOVM2anUxNDgzSDRjWjhPY0RoVjd6b01nOHFscDV2c0tjT1REdllNalpxdG5IdjhvTTQzVmdFdkZDVVgtcE9LODVMei1Galg4dDhGTnZfZHMxblNjSEdtdTlfbWtJNGZUZExOQlpMQVhOazFuNXZHQkF2MUdrNkJwcjExTmRjRTVCR19idGdKSDhJVHNERQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;LONDON -- &lt;/span&gt;LONDON (AP) — &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-chikungunya-virus-outbreak-control-measures-3ee97c21152b05ed0912af646594eafd"&gt;Chinese authorities&lt;/a&gt; have taken measures this week to try to curb the spread of &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya"&gt;chikungunya&lt;/a&gt;, a virus that often causes fever and joint pain. As of Wednesday, the government reported there had been more than 7,000 cases, mostly in the southern manufacturing hub of Foshan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Here's what to know about chikungunya: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya is a disease caused by a virus of the same name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The chikungunya virus was first identified in people sickened during an outbreak in Tanzania in 1952. Its name is derived from a word in the Makonde language, which means “that which bends up,” due to the severe pain it can cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya is transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly causes mild symptoms. The majority of people who get chikungunya recover without needing medical attention after one to two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya typically produces symptoms including fever, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue and a rash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But in rare cases, it can cause debilitating joint pain that persists for months or even years. Patients who get severely ill often require hospitalization because of the risk of organ damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The World Health Organization says severe cases and deaths are rare and mostly occur in babies or elderly people with underlying health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no specific treatment for chikungunya, but health workers can treat the symptoms by giving medicines to lower fevers or ease muscle pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Two vaccines have been approved in several regions, including Britain, Brazil, Canada and Europe. Those are mostly targeted at travelers and are not widely available in the countries most affected by chikungunya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chikungunya causes regular outbreaks in Africa, Asia and the Americas, with occasional small epidemics in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As of July, there have been about 240,000 cases of chikungunya, including 90 deaths in 16 countries, according to the European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control. The countries that reported the highest number of infections were Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Peru. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An outbreak of chikungunya in Foshan, near Hong Kong, has prompted Chinese authorities to take measures like distributing mosquito nets, having workers spray residential areas, streets and construction sites with insecticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People who do not empty bottles, flower pots or other outdoor receptacles, where water might accumulate and allow mosquitoes to breed, can be subject to fines of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,400) and have their electricity cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The U.S. has issued a travel advisory telling citizens not to visit China’s Guangdong province, the location of Donguan and several other business hubs, along with countries such as Bolivia and island nations in the Indian Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Unusually heavy rains and high temperatures this year have worsened the crisis in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was in a coma for six days last year, because I collapsed at home from pneumonia. I was sedated and intubated. I remember not feeling well, and needing to sleep in the recliner, then some blips, a ride in an ambulance, some very violent dreams and nightmares, then literally waking up during a nightmare about attending my own funeral. The nightmares were so real, I can still recount them in detail...it felt like lifetimes. Honestly, it changed a lot about how I view things."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"It took me around three days to re-orient to 2024, and that I hadn't died, and hadn't lost our younger son to violence. In fact, I only had one kid, anyway, and he was hale hearty and right there. For days, though, I was suspicious that people just didn't want to tell me that one of my two kids died, he had a name and everything. It was fucking terrifying. I had what they call 'coma dementia' for about 3–4 months after. I had to relearn everything: walking, talking, fine motor skills, everything. I couldn't even feed myself the first week, could basically only move my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have everything back; I worked really hard after that to get healthy and fix so many things. I feel lucky; I got to attend my own funeral, and came back from it. I always appreciated life, but after all that? I know it's cliche, but every day I wake up, I just fucking treasure it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1m4v0n2/those_who_have_been_into_coma_and_eventually_woke/n48xwvf/" target="_blank"&gt;Arachne93&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The bulk of scientific research focuses on why we delay pain, not pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SUA4YYWXRBAHZOYZL36ENZGWQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But we can also put off things we &lt;i&gt;enjoy&lt;/i&gt; — catching up with a friend we haven’t seen in a while, visiting a nearby attraction or opening that expensive bottle of wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AKU3GUCAEVEGZMVZC3XBX4MUEM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/6/pgaf156/8159305" target="_blank"&gt;PNAS Nexus&lt;/a&gt; explored this hidden side of procrastination. And it found a surprising pattern — the longer we put off doing something we enjoy, the &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; likely we are to continue putting it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DOCUIM7WFZB7ZLPU5BDXFCXF6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This may be because of the “psychological drama” we build up around the experience, suggested &lt;a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/o/ed-o-brien" target="_blank"&gt;Ed O’Brien&lt;/a&gt;, the study’s author and an associate professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SZ3YPXFHRJHGTA6A7KD4QGRSIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s as if we believe that our first time back to, say, a favorite restaurant or reconnecting with a friend “shouldn’t be wasted.

&lt;p&gt;Nutrition is another key piece, though perhaps not as key as walking. According to the original study mentioned, researchers need more and consistent information on the most beneficial dietary factors and how different foods affect different biomarkers (the latter includes certain proteins, blood pressure and tumors, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it’s important to note that most current research looks at a combination of factors, not diet alone. “Pairing [walking] with nutrient-rich foods … gives the brain the building blocks it needs to stay resilient,” Zubkov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that said, knowledge about &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/11-foods-experts-say-can-boost-your-brain-health-and-help-ward-off-dementia-ano_l_66f567a8e4b064e1788b9cd3" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918143"&gt;brain-healthy foods&lt;/a&gt; does exist. The study found positive results with the MIND-diet, or the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay. It’s a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) antihypertensive diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.barrowneuro.org/wp-content/uploads/MIND-Diet-1.pdf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918143" data-affiliate="true"&gt;MIND-diet includes&lt;/a&gt; whole grains; dark, leafy, green vegetables; nuts; olive oil; berries; and even red wine, among other foods and beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubkov recommended a few key nutrients: omega-3s, antioxidants and polyphenols. More specifically, he encouraged people to eat fatty fish, walnuts, leafy greens and berries, and to drink green tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other ways to generate BDNF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Signs of a rogue immune system may be present more than a decade before the debilitating physical symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) reveal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study found poor mental health may be one of the earliest hints of this disease, which impacts about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-may-explain-how-this-virus-can-cause-multiple-sclerosis-in-some-people"&gt;2.8 million people globally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of British Columbia epidemiologist Marta Ruiz-Algueró and colleagues investigated the medical histories of 2,038 patients with MS in Canada and compared them to 10,182 patients without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-balance-of-gut-bacteria-could-play-a-crucial-role-in-how-ms-develops"&gt;A Balance of Gut Bacteria Could Play a Crucial Role in How MS Develops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found patients who went on to develop MS had presented to their physicians with symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="170022" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; more often than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, these clues appeared as early as 15 years before more established symptoms were first detected. &lt;span&gt;The researchers also identified a spike in visits to neurologists and ophthalmologists around 8 to 9 years before their diagnosis. This was then followed by a surge of visits for physical symptoms in the lead-up to diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're only now starting to understand what these early warning signs are, with mental health-related issues appearing to be among the earliest indicators," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/08/ms-early-signs/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ruiz-Algueró.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These patterns suggest that MS has a long and complex prodromal phase – where something is happening beneath the surface but hasn't yet declared itself as MS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of poor mental health are common throughout the population, the researchers caution, and most people who experience them will not go on to develop MS. Still, if we can better understand how such signs relate to MS, it may become possible to identify risk factors and earlier interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"MS can be difficult to recognize as many of the earliest signs – like fatigue, headache, pain, and mental health concerns – can be quite general and easily mistaken for other conditions," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2025/08/ms-early-signs/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; University of British Columbia epidemiologist Helen Tremlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune systems of people with MS mistakenly attack their nerves' fatty protective coating, called the myelin sheath. This can eventually lead to pain, loss of sensation, and loss of motor function in different parts of the body, as the connection between the body and the brain becomes compromised. Fatigue, vision disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction are also common symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170024" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170024" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339.jpg" alt="Diagram of neuron damage in MS" class="wp-image-170024 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339.jpg 722w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-642x429.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-620x415.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GettyImages-530457339-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170024" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The impact multiple sclerosis has on nerves.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Takuya Karasawa, an expert in diabetes and metabolism at the University of Utah and study co-author, added: 'It's unlikely that the observed lean mass loss represents a serious adverse effect.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers found Ozempic-induced weight loss decreased lean muscle mass in mice by around 10 per cent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But skeletal muscles shrunk by only around six per cent. By contrast, muscle from other tissue like the liver shrunk by nearly half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers then tested the amount of force the mice's muscles exerted and discovered that some muscle strength decreased as the mice lost weight, even when the size of the muscle stayed roughly the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(25)00331-6"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists said this potential loss of strength when taking Ozempic could be a particular concern for adults over the age of 60 who are at a higher risk of muscle loss and reduced mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Katsu Funai, a professor of nutrition at the University of Utah and study co-author, added: 'The loss of physical function is a strong predictor of not just quality of life but longevity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts, who weren't involved in the research, however said the findings need to be taken with 'huge helpings of caution'.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Lora Heisler, chair of human nutrition at the University of Aberdeen, said: 'What is still an open question is whether the small degree of muscle loss observed in some patients taking Wegovy or similar medicines influences muscle strength or performance. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The study suggests that it might do in mice, but there needs to be huge helpings of caution taken alongside this as this study was conducted in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The change in muscle function was only found in one type of muscle, and consistently found with one dose of drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, further research studies are needed in humans to understand the impact of Wegovy and other similar medications on muscle loss, strength, and performance.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At least half a million &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-5e5593b0-f855-11ef-8279-ffcfdae8d660"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; patients and some 15million patients in the US are now thought to be using weight-loss jabs, which can help patients lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the numbers using them privately are even higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Under official guidelines, only patients who have a body mass index (BMI) of over 35 and at least one weight-related health problem like high blood pressure, or those who have a BMI of 30 to 34.9 and meet the criteria for referral to a specialist weight management service, should be prescribed weight loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, law forbids the sale of such drugs without a prescription from a medical professional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:50:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQNUNyV0lZZ3hHRkFxNzhkdVpEVHlSekVxMnBUTzU4eGVrMEV4RlBFbWJTS0trUkpFY0dtVVp5SFRHQXFGcWxFS2NtR1FKOXdBWlBvMGw2TW9BcW5CTnRYWV9TZWdHTXJINDZrT2E4alVxeGJKbzRQZlBSMUlkTmxvcG8tWUlzZnpkVnc2dXMxQW5rSUdCX3B5aFU4ckpCeEsxLU4wWHE1b0hYNXd0OGJFcWNn0gG3AUFVX3lxTE9hSVllZkxZdTZqeEhPeGZ4M0dhWlhsQzFtYkFSOTRjY0xHQkNuN2M0M3hBVGJqV1JqMnFGR2psX2llVkF3MTlOOTRQdTdOVkgyUmJoU18yVzhhZ29vdUh0SVlmZlVXRTNQOTJMeE15bmlIbW5uSkM2dnRXUHpWeVdSYVhlWl91T3FobkhzT2Z3R0FpaEJqT0ZSTkQ1YVFucVRLeDNROWtwemhLYkJXRFNKS2xKdlE2QQ</guid></item><item><title>44年的研究表明，骑自行车可以将痴呆风险降低88 ％ -汤姆指南</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxPbC1xRGxvdUJKSUVfMDRZYnVzOHRUN3cxdTc5VHI5dHlIRE4wYUhFbW40ODZNYXRZcG83WHZtdjJnbks3VHNySjR5cU1ZSmUyNzVwTXdaT2tCYlhnQVNQZ1BSVWQzcEpLTm8wWTlROU5WVXYtb3AwRjhWRVFOalF1d3RsMHRwbzhUQ3oyWW1jemtTMUx1U0FqQ1hvMEZvdnN6S3Y5dVQ5YkduVHZRV2xqdWlGQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting older is inevitable, but there’s been a host of studies that prove regular exercise is one of the best ways to future-proof your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data shows that women make up two thirds of dementia cases globally, with the loss of estrogen during menopause increasing the risk of the most common types of dementia. Yet a 44-year study, published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29540588/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29540588/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has &lt;strong&gt;linked cycling to long-term brain protection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-the-study-shows-3"&gt;What the study shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at a sample of 1462 women aged 38 to 60. At the start of the study, between 1968-1970, 191 of the women completed a maximal cycling test on a stationary bike. They performed various cycling intervals, cycling at a low intensity, and increasing the intensity every few minutes until they reached exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their peak workload achieved at exhaustion was recorded. This was measured in watts, and researchers used it as a marker for their maximal cardiovascular fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers concluded that high fitness delayed the age of dementia onset by 9.5 years, and that the women who demonstrated high cardio fitness had an 88% lower risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women in the study were then examined for signs of dementia in 1974, 1980, 2000, 2005, and 2009. This included neuropsychiatric examinations, interviews with the women, and hospital records. The researchers also looked at socioeconomic factors, like income and education, as well as the women’s diets, smoking habits, and any existing illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that only 5% of the highly fit women, based on the scores in the cycling tests at the beginning of the study, developed dementia, compared to 32% in the moderate group. The researchers concluded that high fitness delayed the age of dementia onset by 9.5 years, and that the women who demonstrated high cardio fitness had an 88% lower risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-cycling-3"&gt;How to get started with cycling &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not into cycling, or you don’t have the space to install one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-exercise-bikes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-exercise-bikes"&gt;best exercise bikes&lt;/a&gt; in your home, don’t panic. Building cardiovascular fitness can be achieved through swimming, running, and even fast walking, so it’s not just biking that holds memory-boosting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sszGckW5obZpePWguHkjaF" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sszGckW5obZpePWguHkjaF slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, while this is an impressive longitudinal study, there are limitations — for example, the women classified as “highly fit” are likely to have a better diet and healthier habits. What’s more, the study only looked at Swedish women. More research is needed into the subject, but staying fit and healthy as you get older is definitely beneficial for your physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

Screen time included either watching TV or using electronic devices. Cardiometabolic health data measured cholesterol levels, blood sugar levels, waist measurements, blood pressure and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Each additional hour of screen time was associated with higher cardiometabolic risk for both kids and teenagers. Teenagers with excess screen time were especially at risk. Additionally, the risk was heightened for kids and teenagers reporting fewer hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This study helps bolster our confidence in the finding that screen time in youth can adversely impact cardiometabolic health," Dr. Amanda Marma Perak, chair of the American Heart Association's Young Hearts Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Committee, and an assistant professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, wrote in a statement to ABC news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Previous long-term studies have confirmed a link between cardiovascular disease in adulthood and higher screen time in teens. But this is the first study that looked at associations between cardiometabolic risk and screen time for both kids and teens, Perak noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, this does not imply that excess screen time directly affects cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This was still an observational study showing correlation rather than an experiment showing causation," Perak wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Another limitation of the study was a lack of distinguishing between screen time used for educational purposes versus more passive screen time like scrolling through social media or texting with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Other studies have suggested that it's the more passive screen time -- like watching TV for older generations, and scrolling social media for today's youth -- that is probably most detrimental, Perak wrote. "On the other hand, more active screen use -- like looking up new information, creating things (like videos or online illustrated books), or communicating (like FaceTime) with friends and family -- may not adversely impact heart health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study highlights the importance of jointly considering screen time and sleep patterns for promoting cardiovascular health in kids and teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Perak pointed out that youth who spend more time glued to their screens tend to have worse heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"And secondarily, the combination of more time on screens plus going to bed late and/or not getting enough sleep appears to be more harmful for heart health," she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Perak added that she'd like to see more studies to understand the impact screen time may have on long-term cardiovascular health in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Jennifer Miao is a board-certified cardiologist, critical care and interventional cardiology fellow at Yale School of Medicine/YNHH, and a fellow with the ABC News' Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 11:15:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPWEtmc3VzdGxpWkJ5X0ttVFJJSFlyal9XblJWZVgxcWU4ZzZQNGY3X1V1d0hDUEY4V2IwR203c1RITDhVZGlVa3lKOHZ5eFJQMXRUTXVOSkxGaWdNYzhRclpKcG52TWtGMXdQcmV6dncxOUxDa2JfME9pdnQzUVBseFJBYWR1TE1vU1hwdklaY0JRemxha1BEcNIBngFBVV95cUxPakRfaWR6dFBmM2JyRXZFRVNwWUNqYk9UOVA2T2Q4WER5YVVnZWJmaGZYcDdhc3Q4bEh1MTdndVR0NzZaaTVhTW9Qd0ZVY3hSRlFiQjhadHZZRkNhcndvRC1VdDI2YmJiU3FpaEZuaFdGaldCdGZQTXJOWjBoWlByTjByX3YwdDc2TTdSWjFzV0RnOTFYWlBjWWpkUV9tdw</guid></item><item><title>爸爸惊讶地发现口交导致癌症后以为他从健身房跑了下来- LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQZ25wcW56a09Id2xoNmhYNjY2ZjVwSjV1anhha2tKbjRENXlLdEJlNDlZSGdiMWhNWm9YT0hhdnpwOVVibWJYbEliLVFRa29SZ2FLN0NxN2VrTFRmcVdsNV9oYWxJZWVRbHFoWlNWN1YxQ0JFYlNVVWtJRmdIMGNGR1FUejZaZXdLcnJodnhxWk5xMDBMY3pWcG83dUdaZzFvOEtuZVNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A father-of-two was left floored after doctors informed him a suspicious-looking lump in his throat was cancer - which they believe was caused by oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Frank Lane said he initially thought that &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; experts were 'talking a load of rubbish' when they informed him of the intimate source of his illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But after doing some of his own research into &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/warning-sex-act-rise-in-mouth-cancer-574275-20241115"&gt;the link between cunnilingus and mouth cancer&lt;/a&gt;, he realised that the multiple flings he had in his early 20s might be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The HGV driver, from Basingstoke, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;Hampshire&lt;/a&gt;, explained that his ordeal first began when he noticed a firm lump in his neck which was 'the size of a boiled egg' two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I was having a shave, felt my neck and thought 'that feels a bit hard'," Frank said.

It is thought the virus may &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/oral-sex-bigger-risk-throat-cancer-doctor-tiktok-803218-20231103"&gt;have a similar effect on the cells of the throat&lt;/a&gt;, although further research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The 60-year-old received the diagnosis after a lump appeared in his neck (Kennedy News and Media)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;HPV typically does not cause any symptoms, and most people who have it don't even realise, as it can take decades for it to develop into something more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-papilloma-virus-and-cancer"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; the World Health Organisation, it usually takes 15-20 years for cervical cancer to develop after the initial HPV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Frank, who was in the Royal Corps of Signals for 12 years, said he was told that his biopsy results suggested he'd contracted the virus up to 40 years earlier, when he was just 20 and sexually active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"I was having fun, but I wasn't messing about with loads of different girls," he said of his younger years.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnuwz00133b79itodnp3a@published"&gt;I’ve had a very eventful year. At the beginning of 2025, my long-term relationship ended, and after a few months, I decided to move out of state.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxmdr2q00143b79qww2ngus@published"&gt;Just before moving, I started a GLP-1 weight loss drug, and I have successfully lost most of the pandemic weight I’d been packing on (yay!). The problem is I’m flying back to my hometown for a visit soon, and I’m quite sure my visible weight loss will be an uncomfortable topic of conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxmpjql001v3b7925puj50k@published"&gt;My mom has suffered from undiagnosed eating disorders since I was a child, and my aunt, who I’m very close to, is a bit of a fitness and health nut. My aunt has made negative comments about weight loss drugs, suggesting people should “just get off the couch and exercise.” Because of the way my mom and aunt have always talked about fatness and weight loss, I very much do not want to talk to them about my body or disclose that I lost the weight via a GLP-1 drug. I’m otherwise pretty open about my journey to friends who ask. I think it’s helpful for people to know the drugs do work (at least for me!) and don’t think everyone can lose weight via willpower alone, as I certainly couldn’t. What do you think the best approach will be to talk about it as little as possible with my family? I’m anticipating compliments and questions about how I lost the weight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv4v00173b79gf9vembn@published"&gt;You are feeling good about your body and health, and you’re visiting people whom you love (even if you might not always like everything about them that much). This&lt;em&gt; should&lt;/em&gt; be a good time. So it’s really too bad that this upcoming visit is becoming a source of stress because of all of the baggage and judgment you’re going to have to navigate. It’s hard to have fun and difficult to connect with people when you’re on edge. How can you relax when you’re constantly bracing to hear a comment that will agitate you, chip away at your self-esteem, or take you right back to being a child, confused about why you’re hearing adults obsess over their bodies and the bodies of strangers?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="177" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv7a00183b79v35chs0t@published"&gt;I definitely understand that you want to avoid feeling that way. And if you really think the best way forward is to avoid any conversations about your body, you should warn your mom and aunt before you show up. They’ve been obsessing out loud about weight for your entire life, so it’s only fair to give them some time to adjust to the idea that their typical remarks will be unwelcome. Here’s a text to send to the two of them: “Hi Mom and Aunt Barbara, I can’t wait to see you! I wanted to give you a heads up that when you see me, you’re probably going to notice that I’ve lost a few pounds. I know we’ve always talked about weight a lot, but lately, having a lot of attention on the way my body has changed has made me uncomfortable, so I’d rather not discuss it at all. I thought I’d let you know before I arrived. Thanks for understanding, and of course, we’ll have a lot of other things to catch up on!”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdxbnv9800193b79m1j47d8p@published"&gt;But I have to say, banning discussion of your weight loss might shine even more of a spotlight on the change. Putting the topic in a category all to itself sort of elevates it to something with special importance. It gives it a lot of energy. And you’re still going to be acutely aware of what they’re noticing, what they’re thinking, and what they’re talking about when you leave. So I wonder if you’d be willing to engage in a brief exchange in which you take control of the narrative instead, responding to any remarks and pointedly— but still breezily and briefly—setting a new tone. Using this approach could go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

I’m so happy for you! I need to lose more, too. I’m on this new diet where you just eat between the hours of—&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You: &lt;/strong&gt;Thanks, I do feel good in my body now, but I also felt good before, and I know my weight could always change again, so I’m trying not to obsess over it. It just feels sad to think about diets and food all the time. Anyway! Something more exciting that’s going on in my life right now is…&lt;/p&gt;

That’s too bad for you because I know it’s a huge point of pride. But I hope doing it your way made you &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Screen time doesn't just affect &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/teens-4-hours-screen-time-anxiety-depression/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It may also take a toll on the physical health of &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/groundbreaking-study-examines-effects-of-screen-time-on-kids-60-minutes/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;children and teens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, according to new research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.12.24310353" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, the research found 10- and 18-year-olds who spent more time focused on devices, including phones, televisions, computers and gaming consoles, were at higher risk for cardiometabolic diseases, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a small change per hour, but when screen time accumulates to three, five or even six hours a day, as we saw in many adolescents, that adds up," lead author David Horner, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said in a news release. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found 18-year-olds were on devices about 6 hours a day, on average, while 10-year-olds averaged 3 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found sleep impacted the results, with both less sleep and later bedtimes amplifying the relationship between screen time and heart health risks. That suggests screen time may harm health by "stealing" time from sleep, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Limiting discretionary screen time in childhood and adolescent may protect long-term heart and metabolic health," Horner said. "Our study provides evidence that this connection starts early and highlights the importance of having balanced daily routines." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was observational, meaning it found associations rather than proved cause and effect. It also had some limitations, including that participants self-reported screen time, which might not accurately reflect how much time they were actually on devices. &lt;/p&gt;

roughly 7,000 people since late June, with most cases concentrated in the city of Foshan, in Guangdong province, just north of Hong Kong. This marks the country’s largest chikungunya outbreak since the virus was first identified there in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="193"&gt;Here is what we know about the disease and how it is spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-chikungunya-virus" data-start="0" data-end="193"&gt;What is the chikungunya virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These mosquitoes also carry and spread dengue, yellow fever and the Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name, chikungunya, derives from a word in the Kimakonde language, spoken in Tanzania and Mozambique, meaning “to become contorted”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In most cases, patients will feel better within a week. In many cases, however, the joint pain can last for months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but deaths are rare. If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="55" data-end="214"&gt;People most at risk of serious illness from chikungunya include newborns, older adults and those with existing health problems such as heart disease or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="268"&gt;There is no cure for the chikungunya virus, but the death rate is low, except in high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="216" data-end="268"&gt;If an infected mosquito bites a healthy human, it injects the virus into the bloodstream. If a non-infected mosquito bites a person who is already infected, it sucks the virus from that person’s blood and becomes a carrier capable of transmitting the virus to others through bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3270421 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-01-1729771918.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-transmission" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-bad-is-the-current-spread-of-the-virus"&gt;How bad is the current spread of the virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the current surge in cases began in early 2025, with major outbreaks in Indian Ocean Islands, including La Reunion, Mayotte and Mauritius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In La Reunion, more than 47,500 cases of chikungunya and 12 associated deaths were reported up to May 2025, with sustained high transmission across the island, according to the WHO. The ECDC also reports that as of July 18, there were more than 54,000 cases reported from La Reunion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is now the most serious chikungunya outbreak in La Reunion since the 2005–2006 epidemic, which saw an estimated 244,000 to more than 300,000 cases, and prompted large-scale public health efforts to control mosquito breeding and limit transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus has also spread to other countries, including Madagascar, Somalia and Kenya, and has shown signs of epidemic-level transmission in parts of Southeast Asia, as well as India, where financial capital Mumbai has seen a surge in cases since July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO has also raised concerns about the rising number of imported chikungunya cases in Europe. Since May 1, about 800 imported cases have been reported in mainland France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the ECDC, the Americas as a region have reported the highest number of chikungunya cases globally. As of mid-July 2025, the countries with the most cases in the region include Brazil (185,553), Bolivia (4,721), Argentina (2,836) and Peru (55).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In China, infections have been reported in at least 12 cities across southern Guangdong province, in addition to Foshan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities said that an “imported case triggered local transmission” in July, but did not specify where the infection originated. According to experts, rising global temperatures have led to warmer and wetter weather, allowing mosquitoes to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, on Saturday, Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202508/02/P2025080200897.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; its first case of chikungunya: a 12-year-old boy who developed a fever, rash and joint pain since July 31, after visiting Foshan. This was the territory’s first case of the virus in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3270415 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-02-1729771842.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C962&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Interactive_Chikungunya_October24_2024-symptoms" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-are-china-and-other-countries-fighting-the-spread"&gt;How are China and other countries fighting the spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-start="138" data-end="270"&gt;According to a Bloomberg news report, China has promised to take swift and decisive action to contain the spread of the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="138" data-end="270"&gt;Drones are being used to find places where mosquitoes are breeding. At the same time, scientists are releasing large “elephant mosquitoes” – about 2cm (0.8 inches) long – whose larvae eat the smaller mosquitoes that spread the virus. Health experts hope these mosquito helpers will play an important role in stopping the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="138" data-end="270"&gt;According to a report by the BBC, residents of affected areas in China have been ordered to eliminate standing water in and around their homes – including in flowerpots, coffee machines and empty bottles. Noncompliance may result in fines of up to 10,000 yuan (approximately $1,400), and in more serious cases, people could face criminal charges for “obstructing the prevention of infectious diseases”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="987" data-end="1255"&gt;Citing local sources, The New York Times said that in some instances, infected residents in Foshan are being moved to “quarantine wards”, where they are kept behind mosquito nets and screens. Some patients also say they were given no choice but to seek treatment at their own expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="987" data-end="1255"&gt;In other places, such as La Reunion and Mayotte, authorities have also launched enhanced surveillance, mosquito control initiatives and targeted vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="987" data-end="1255"&gt;The Basque Country in Spain activated preventive protocols after a case was detected in Hendaye, just across the border in France. The protocols include increased surveillance in border towns and encouraging people to make reports through apps such as Mosquito Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-chikungunya-be-prevented-and-treated"&gt;How can chikungunya be prevented and treated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities advise protecting oneself against mosquito bites as the most effective strategy against the spread of chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may involve wearing long sleeves and trousers, applying mosquito repellents, removing bodies of standing water where mosquitoes can breed, and staying in closed, air-conditioned spaces indoors or behind mosquito netting when outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are no specific medicines to treat the virus, rest, fluids and pain relievers may help alleviate symptoms, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="0" data-end="214" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;However, some pain relievers may be unsafe during a suspected infection. The CDC recommends avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until dengue is ruled out, as they can raise the risk of bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_3874547" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3874547" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3874547" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2024-07-25T004356Z_362697650_RC2H09A5EM6M_RTRMADP_3_GUATEMALA-DENGUE-1754441362.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are examined at the entomology department of the Health Ministry, in Guatemala City, Guatemala, July 22, 2024.

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Mark Jurkowitz  | Outer Banks Voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of a WRAL report that a man has been hospitalized on the Outer Banks as the result of a Vibrio vulnificus infection, the Dare County Department of Health and Human Service (DCHHS) is reporting two known cases in the county and providing guidance on how to prevent potentially dangerous recreational water-related illnesses (RWIs).&lt;span id="more-340640"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-c184ecb16f807fdb29f1f18f87633242 outer-mobile-content-one" id="outer-c184ecb16f807fdb29f1f18f87633242"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first case reported to DCHSS was a Vibrio vulnificus infection that resulted from the individual swimming in the Croatan Sound with a cut on their forearm. That person was hospitalized from July 15-20 and then released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second case involves a patient who was hospitalized on July 28 and remains in the hospital with a Vibrio vulnificus infection. The infection occurred after that person waded into the Croatan Sound with an open would on the ankle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-2b2a66b20457769d15e375d9a3b63180 outer-mobile-content-top" id="outer-2b2a66b20457769d15e375d9a3b63180"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-8ae6e85b034530982705cee0128728aa outer-content-top" id="outer-8ae6e85b034530982705cee0128728aa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 4 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 5, the DCHSS also released this information on WRIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dare County Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services would like to remind the public of the importance of preventing recreational water-related illnesses (RWIs). RWIs are caused by germs or chemicals found in water bodies such as swimming pools, hot tubs, lakes, rivers, estuaries, and oceans. It is important to understand how to prevent these illnesses and enjoy water activities safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RWIs are infections that can be contracted by swallowing, breathing in, or having contact with contaminated water. The most common types of RWIs include gastrointestinal illnesses, skin infections, respiratory infections, and ear infections. These illnesses can be caused by various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-7fea93195e178a29f476e72043cff949 outer-mobile-content-mid" id="outer-7fea93195e178a29f476e72043cff949"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing what we traditionally see with recreational water illnesses during the summer. Our department will stay vigilant in surveillance, but we are experiencing nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year in a coastal environment,” said Sheila Davies, Director of DCHHS. “It’s important to remember bacteria is naturally in the water, however, the risk of getting sick to the general public remains very low. Commercial fishermen, specifically crabbers, are at a higher risk due to the nature of their job. It is essential for all to follow water safety recommendations to help minimize the risk of developing water-related illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-6c2d91bb9f6f9ac3b649e101529f4971 outer-content-mid" id="outer-6c2d91bb9f6f9ac3b649e101529f4971"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DCHHS recommends the following safety tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swim if you’re sick.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have diarrhea or any other contagious illness, avoid swimming or entering any recreational water facilities. This will help prevent the contamination of water and the spread of germs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swim if you have a compromised immune system or open wounds.&lt;/strong&gt; People with weakened immune systems should consult their healthcare provider before participating in recreational water activities, such as swimming. Open wounds such as cuts, scrapes, and recent tattoos can leave you more susceptible to illness. If you have a wound, including from a recent surgery, piercing, or tattoo, stay out of salt or brackish water, if possible. This includes wading at the beach. Cover your wounds with a waterproof bandage if it could come into contact with salt water, brackish water, or raw or undercooked seafood and its juices. Promptly tend to any wounds, cuts or abrasions you get while in or near the water. Thoroughly wash the wound with clean, drinkable water and soap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shower before swimming.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a quick shower with soap and water before entering the water. This helps remove any germs or contaminants on your body, reducing the risk of spreading them into the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t swallow the water.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoid swallowing water while swimming or participating in water activities. Ingesting even a small amount of contaminated water can lead to illness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use proper hygiene practices.&lt;/strong&gt; Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after using the restroom or changing diapers. This is crucial in preventing the spread of germs to others and reducing the risk of contamination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change diapers in designated areas.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have young children who wear diapers, change them in designated diaper-changing areas and not near the water. Dispose of diapers properly to prevent contamination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep water clean.&lt;/strong&gt; If you own a pool or hot tub, maintain proper water chemistry and filtration systems. Regularly test the water and ensure it meets the recommended standards. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning and maintaining your pool or hot tub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid swimming in high-risk areas or situations.&lt;/strong&gt; Heavy rainfalls can wash contaminants into recreational water bodies, increasing the risk of RWIs. Wait at least 24-48 hours after heavy rainfall before swimming to allow the water to clear. Avoid swimming near ocean outfalls at all times. Marine or ocean outfalls discharge wastewater, stormwater, and other potentially contaminated waters to the sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay informed.&lt;/strong&gt; Check for any local advisories or warnings regarding water quality before swimming or participating in water activities. Stay updated on any closures or restrictions in your area. Further information regarding advisories may be obtained from North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality (NCDEQ) by visiting their &lt;a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/marine-fisheries/shellfish-sanitation-and-recreational-water-quality/recreational-water-quality"&gt;NC Recreational Water Quality Swimming Advisory Map&lt;/a&gt; or signing up to receive NCDEQ press releases on their  &lt;a href="https://www.deq.nc.gov/news/press-release?field_agency_department_target_id=1091"&gt;Water Quality Swimming Advisories&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach children about water safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Educate children about the importance of not swallowing water, using proper hygiene practices, and following safety rules while swimming or playing in water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report any water quality concerns.&lt;/strong&gt; If you notice any issues with water quality or suspect an outbreak of RWIs, report it to the appropriate authorities, such as North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, your local health department and/or pool operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek medical care if you become ill.&lt;/strong&gt; If you get cut while in the sound or ocean, seek a doctor’s care if you become ill, a rash or swelling develops around the wound, or it appears infected.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Centenarians, once considered rare, have become commonplace. Indeed, they are the &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/living-to-one-hundred-life-expectancy/"&gt;fastest-growing demographic group&lt;/a&gt; of the world's population, with numbers roughly doubling every ten years since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long humans can live, and what determines a long and healthy life, have been of interest for as long as we know. Plato and Aristotle discussed and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12092789/"&gt;wrote about the ageing process&lt;/a&gt; over 2,300 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of understanding the secrets behind exceptional longevity isn't easy, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;Study Reveals Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Accelerates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7105197/"&gt;unravelling the complex interplay&lt;/a&gt; of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors and how they interact throughout a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now our recent study, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-00936-w"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; has unveiled some common biomarkers, including levels of cholesterol and glucose, in people who live past 90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonagenarians and centenarians have long been of intense interest to scientists as they may help us understand how to live longer, and perhaps also how to age in better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, studies of centenarians have often been small scale and focused on a selected group, for example, excluding centenarians who live in care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103536" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-642x260.jpg" alt="Old Woman Holds Her Young Photo Up" class="wp-image-103536 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/OldWomanHoldsHerYoungPhotoUp.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103536" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Dimitri Otis/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Huge dataset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ours is the largest study comparing biomarker profiles measured throughout life among exceptionally long-lived people and their shorter-lived peers to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compared the biomarker profiles of people who went on to live past the age of 100, and their shorter-lived peers, and investigated the link between the profiles and the chance of becoming a centenarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research included data from 44,000 Swedes who underwent health assessments at ages 64-99 - they were a sample of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28158674/"&gt;the so-called Amoris cohort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_87621" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-87621" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-642x260.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-87621 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/02/GeneticMutationImpressionWithGlowingCentreOfDNA-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-87621" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants were then followed through Swedish register data for up to 35 years. Of these people, 1,224, or 2.7%, lived to be 100 years old. The vast majority (85%) of the centenarians were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve blood-based biomarkers related to inflammation, metabolism, liver and kidney function, as well as potential malnutrition and anaemia, were included. All of these &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0719-5"&gt;have been associated&lt;/a&gt; with ageing or mortality in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biomarker related to inflammation was uric acid – a waste product in the body caused by the digestion of certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also looked at markers linked to metabolic status and function including total cholesterol and glucose, and ones related to liver function, such as alanine aminotransferase (Alat), aspartate aminotransferase (Asat), albumin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (Alp) and lactate dehydrogenase (LD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also looked at creatinine, which is linked to kidney function, and iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), which is linked to anaemia. Finally, we also investigated albumin, a biomarker associated with nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_135978" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-135978" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-642x260.jpg" alt="older couple at beach" class="size-medium wp-image-135978" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_couple_ADRD.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-135978" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Studies of centenarians have often been small scale. (Halfpoint Images/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that, on the whole, those who made it to their hundredth birthday tended to have lower levels of glucose, creatinine and uric acid from their sixties onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the median values didn't differ significantly between centenarians and non-centenarians for most biomarkers, centenarians seldom displayed extremely high or low values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, very few of the centenarians had a glucose level above 6.5 mmol/L earlier in life, or a creatinine level above 125 µmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of the biomarkers, both centenarians and non-centenarians had values outside of the range considered normal in clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is probably because these guidelines are set based on a younger and healthier population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exploring which biomarkers were linked to the likelihood of reaching 100, we found that all but two (alat and albumin) of the 12 biomarkers showed a connection to the likelihood of turning 100. This was even after accounting for age, sex and disease burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people in the lowest out of five groups for levels of total cholesterol and iron had a lower chance of reaching 100 years as compared to those with higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people with higher levels of glucose, creatinine, uric acid and markers for liver function also decreased the chance of becoming a centenarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In absolute terms, the differences were rather small for some of the biomarkers, while for others the differences were somewhat more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For uric acid, for instance, the absolute difference was 2.5 percentage points. This means that people in the group with the lowest uric acid had a 4% chance of turning 100 while in the group with the highest uric acid levels only 1.5% made it to age 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the differences we discovered were overall rather small, they suggest a potential link between metabolic health, nutrition and exceptional longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, however, does not allow any conclusions about which lifestyle factors or genes are responsible for the biomarker values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is reasonable to think that factors such as nutrition and alcohol intake play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of your kidney and liver values, as well as glucose and uric acid as you get older, is probably not a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, chance probably plays a role at some point in reaching an exceptional age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the fact that differences in biomarkers could be observed a long time before death suggests that genes and lifestyle may also play a role.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/215166/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;In a small randomized controlled trial, people lost twice as much weight when their diet was limited to minimally processed food compared to when they switched to a diet that included ultraprocessed versions of foods but was otherwise nutritionally matched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03842-0"&gt;published in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at University College London, adds to a growing body of evidence that food processing, in addition to simple nutrition content, influences our weight and health. Ultraprocessed foods have already been vilified for their link to obesity—largely through weaker observational studies—but researchers have struggled to shore up the connection with high-quality studies and understand their impact on health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultraprocessed foods researchers provided in the new trial were relatively healthy ones—as ultraprocessed foods go. They included things like multigrain breakfast cereal, packaged granola bars, flavored yogurt cups, fruit snacks, commercially premade chicken sandwiches, instant noodles, and ready-made lasagna. But, in the minimally processed trial diet, participants received meals from a caterer rather than ones from a grocery store aisle. The diet included overnight oats with fresh fruit, plain yogurt with toasted oats and fruit, handmade fruit and nut bars, freshly made chicken salad, and from-scratch stir fry and spaghetti bolognese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the level of processing differed between the diets, the large-scale nutrition content—fat, protein, carbohydrates, fiber—were similar, as was the proportions of fruits, vegetables, dairy, and starchy food. Overall, both diets adhered to the dietary guidance from the UK government, called the Eatwell Guide (EWG).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diet processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial had a crossover design, meaning that participants were randomly split to start out on either the ultraprocessed food (UPF) diet or the minimally processed food (MPF) diet. They stayed on their starter diet for eight weeks, then took a break, and switched to the other diet. For both diets, food was delivered directly to the participants' homes. Participants ate what they wanted and, mostly, didn't seem to cheat by sneaking other food, based on food diaries and reported adherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty participants completed at least one diet, while 43 completed both diets. The participants were mostly women, with a mean age of 43, and all had a body mass index categorized as overweight or obesity. At the start of the trial, ultraprocessed foods made up, on average, nearly 70 percent of the participants' standard diets, and they were not adhering to the EWG recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

It helps people understand their pain, overcome fear of movement, and rebuild confidence through tailored physical activity and lifestyle coaching, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://info.thelancet.com/hubfs/Press%20embargo/CFTlowbackpain.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and Perth, Australia's Curtin University followed over 300 adults with chronic lower back pain for three years across 20 physical therapy clinics in Australia. Study participants reported fewer pain symptoms at the end of the study after participating in just eight CFT sessions over six months, compared to those who used some other type of therapy to manage their back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Cognitive functional therapy is putting the patient in charge, addressing the person very holistically and looking at all the factors that are relevant,” said Dr. Mark Hancock, lead author of the study and professor of physiotherapy at Macquarie University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Unlike many conventional treatments, CFT doesn't focus on short-term symptom relief. Instead, it teaches patients to reframe how they think about pain, and to shift away from protective or fear-driven behaviors and build self-management skills that ideally last long after the sessions end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Pain patients often have kinesiophobia, where the thought of being in pain and the fear of what it might do to them results in them moving less. But a part of what makes back pain worse is that thought process, so I often tell my patients, 'if you don't use it, you'll lose it,'" said Dr. Rohan Jotwani, an interventional pain specialist and anesthesiologist at Och Spine at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Woman in home office suffering from back pain sitting at computer desk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Boonchai Wedmakawand/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;CFT doesn't involve pills or surgery but can be used alongside other treatments, the study says. While it can be used on its own, it also complements other approaches by helping patients build the skills and confidence to stay active and engaged in daily life, Hancock explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“There’s something happening at a deeper level related to how patients appreciate and process their pain that’s changing, and those skills over time are helping patients feel better even when the therapy ends,” said Jotwani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The treatment worked across a broad range of patients, according to the study, including with participants that had been living with disabling back pain for years and many had tried multiple treatments without success. Even in this group, a relatively short course of CFT led to meaningful, lasting improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers said the key is not just what’s done during the sessions but the shift in the participant's mindset that it creates, giving people tools to manage flare-ups, move with less fear and regain more control over their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The researchers noted some limitations to their study, including that some of the participants dropped out before it was complete. Additionally, all of the subjects were Australian, so it’s unclear whether Americans would respond as positively to CFT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Jotwani said he finds the results promising, especially for patients who haven't found relief through conventional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“There’s not many things that we can say that gives patients three years of relief after an intervention … so these results are quite encouraging,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Michelle Lee, MD, is a doctor in New York City and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 22:35:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQVmdsckt1YzVCZlVSMVg3MXU5aUU1RU5IOTdTMFZmUi00clhhN09WVVJibWQ5cGxZUUpsX2ZFR2VJdFB5OHo4RlFDbHZQZU5jcVBFaW1NSTZJU0dLcFdtNGx3WHhIeThpLWxwemZ2bC05Q2lsSVNENjRlaGtwVXE1R2YtNFVSSllmY3VCUlpQV2NZWEJ1U1I0Qnk5WGZLRHV3aXZzVEpjTGNsZ9IBrwFBVV95cUxOM29LRjM4Vk5INDVmdDNtSnljR25kQmFINnZVXzN1U1Z5SXlLWlczNmtsd2JDRWJkUDNjTTRDRXotQ3o4ZF9DRGZWX19BTWVlRS1mYVVCcGV6TDh3OXNEWDJUVEZ2eEE1V25rRjRHWFU0RUdQSER2ak1pTzZVVHpmaVZVRnlTb2pUaFlScVZweWRKNC11QUdZQ2JkSHNQOEwzQUpySDVuOHNvUk16NUtR</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，童年的言语和身体虐待留下了类似的影响- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPa1lmSUtNeXhpT0x3c0E2M0lzZkVHNlk3dEtoN0Ywb2VqV3pQZGhKZVVfcXV1aFlUSlNFeWtJVi01Z3VLUVpjNXpNcUJ2T003WC0zdVduTXRZVngwbGRqUFFFVXJxd0lWV25JbC0yNkwyMmhiczlrZE1zVWVlelVnWk9TWno0QdIBiwFBVV95cUxNWjJORDM2RTJWX3NJNWY5WU9iSklyVVVXMmhCd1F1SXMyVWUwYkI3T0VySWhib0p5emFjQ3BhQjN5YU41MWtzSlFfRFBiVklQT3lMS3A3WVlkS01fejFwQUFpcTR1UndzZjZQUWM3TVJoX2R6N2FaRkU2OGRQVUV4SUJ5Rm9PdUdHQlRF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Cruel words can leave a mark on a child –– and may have as much of an impact as physical abuse, new research has found﻿.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot00083b6nyablv7mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who experienced physical abuse as a child were at a 50% increased risk of reporting low mental health in adulthood compared with those with no abuse, according to the study published Tuesday in the &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-098412" target="_blank"&gt;journal BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;. Those who experienced verbal abuse had a 60% increase in likelihood of low well-being.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot00093b6n7385a5h1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The prevalence of physical abuse&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in people in England and Wales has halved, from 20% in people born from 1950 to 1979 to 10% in those born in or after 2000, according to the study. Verbal abuse, on the other hand, has increased.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000a3b6nlcp4cerc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, more than 60% of people participating in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmmwr%2Fvolumes%2F73%2Fsu%2Fsu7304a5.htm%23T2_down&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmadeline.holcombe%40cnn.com%7C3775516c14b4437f0bb408ddd3f67c96%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638899777813083208%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=Z75RByubC3lPh4APMZGmIh21dMrKqtzEgC2Zq5sKTms%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;Youth Risk Behavior Survey&lt;/a&gt; reported experiencing emotional abuse and 31.8% reported physical abuse. The survey listed emotional instead of verbal abuse, but asked about similar behaviors as the most recent study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000b3b6nr4zjpf2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In this latest analysis, researchers analyzed data from more than 20,000 adults across seven different studies in England and Wales. The study team evaluated childhood experiences using the Adverse Childhood Experiences tool and components of adult mental health using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000c3b6n4zzakwzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “results suggest that verbal abuse in childhood can leave mental health scars as deep and long-lasting as those caused by physical abuse,” said lead study author Dr. Mark Bellis, professor of public health and behavioral sciences at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000d3b6nh3ctsg9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the United States and the world, there has been an epidemiological shift of a greater burden of verbal abuse across generations, said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Shanta Dube, professor of epidemiology and director of the department of public health at the Levine College of Health Sciences at Wingate University in Wingate, North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000e3b6nod98uj3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She added that emotional abuse is “often tied to the act of verbal abuse and therefore verbal abuse can often get lost.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000f3b6nig2a0j93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rise of verbal abuse amid the decline of physical abuse highlights a need to raise awareness around spoken abuse, especially given the lasting impact, said Dube, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000g3b6nll4nc03a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Verbal abuse may be eroding the mental health benefits we should expect from successful efforts to reduce physical abuse,” Bellis added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000h3b6nmngy67ct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It can be hard to draw the line for sure on what language is harsh and what is verbal abuse, but it can include blaming, insulting, scolding, criticizing or threatening children, said Dr. Andrea Danese, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King’s College London and adjunct clinical professor at the Yale Child Study Center. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000i3b6njh4cg0pa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Think about the use of derogatory terms or statements intended to frighten, humiliate, denigrate or belittle a person,” he said. “It is often unintentional.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000j3b6nh349k3ft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Comments can sound like “Johnny can do it. Why can’t you?” “You always make mistakes,” “You’re stupid,” or “You’re worthless,” Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000k3b6nwqs1bsfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Harsh, denigrating words spoken to children have lasting impacts. Children developmentally are concrete thinkers ‘it is or isn’t,” she said in an email. “They can take things literally.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iot000l3b6n8vm5bwea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children rely on the language of the adults in their immediate environment to learn both about themselves and the world, Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000m3b6nh0eeftp8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Therefore, the way children are talked to can be very powerful in both positive and negative ways, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000n3b6n1jn2yzt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being the subject of verbal abuse can twist a young person’s understanding of who they are and their role in the world,” Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000o3b6npb26ah6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study relies on observational data, meaning that researchers cannot say for sure that verbal abuse in childhood causes poorer mental health in adulthood, only that there is a connection between the two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000p3b6norwmu3w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It could be that people who experience verbal abuse in their younger years have trauma later, but it also could be that adults with worse mental health are more likely to remember their childhood more harshly, Danese said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000q3b6nvq8qrlub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the sample size was large enough and the approach was strong enough to add to the existing evidence around impacts of verbal abuse, Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdz02j8r00123b6n993k1x75@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="language-has-power-good-and-bad" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Language has power –– good and bad
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000r3b6nzkhs9nf8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is increasingly important that researchers and individuals pay attention to the factors that impact long-term mental health, Bellis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000s3b6n4wuoui0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Poor mental health is a major and growing global public health issue, particularly among adolescents and young adults,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000t3b6n27u4utb9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Part of the decline in physical abuse may be attributed to more awareness, data collection and campaigns focused on its reduction over the years, Dube added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000u3b6nwbb9uuvt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Improving childhood environments can directly enhance mental well-being as well as helping build resilience to protect against the future mental health challenges individuals may face through adolescence and adulthood,” Bellis said in an email. “We need to ensure that the harms of verbal abuse are more widely recognised.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000v3b6njezwj8dx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents and caregivers with more information and support may be better equipped to create better home environments for their children, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000w3b6nfnv599ib@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means helping build emotional regulation skills in parents and children, helping catalyse emotional attachment between them, developing their communication skills and encouraging modelling behaviours in parents so that they demonstrate the type of approaches to problems that they would like to see in their children,” Bellis said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000x3b6n1mpjxpxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the issue doesn’t stop with parents –– all adults who interact with children need to understand the impacts of verbal abuse, Dube said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000y3b6nvbbyw7xr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the answer isn’t just to shame adults, Danese said. Instead, he and other researchers are looking to support a cultural shift toward everyone being more mindful about the language used toward children and how it might affect them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz02iou000z3b6nyvc5emti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not about dramatising times when we could have let negative comments on children slip,” he said in an email. “It is about being mindful of them and trying to repair them with an apology, a correction, and an explanation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

when she suffered an unspecified medical emergency, and doctors at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-mexico/index.html" id="mol-cc470d40-723f-11f0-ba30-0b41cee5f01f"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; told her family she would never recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without any hope, her family agreed to donate her organs and preparations were made with procurement organization New Mexico Donor Services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In her final days, Gallegos' family said they saw tears in her eyes - a sign that they say donation coordinators quickly brushed off, claiming watery eyes were just a reflex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the day her organs were set to be taken, one of Gallegos' sisters said she was adamant Danella was still sentient because she saw her move while holding her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors in a pre-surgery room were left stunned when Gallegos, deep in a coma but still medically alive, was able to blink her eyes on the medic's command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the organ coordinator in the room told doctors that they should ply the patient with morphine and move ahead anyway, according to a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/us/organ-transplants-donors-alive.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Danella Gallegos said she feels lucky to be alive after her organs were almost taken while she was still alive in 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The organ donation industry is facing mounting scrutiny amid allegations that it is rife with mistakes and abuse as hospitals try to keep up with demand for organs (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gallegos's doctors defied the coordinators, and they brought her out of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors' decision saved her life - as Gallegos went on to make a full recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel so fortunate,' she says, adding that she recalled feeling fear while in her coma but not much else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it’s also crazy to think how close things came to ending differently.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hospital workers told the Times that they faced pressure from New Mexico Donor Services to forge ahead despite their doubts, which the organization denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The organ harvesting organization said that it does not interfere with medical decision making, and stressed that only hospitals are in charge of caring for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, Presbyterian Hospital said that Donor Services was actually responsible for all aspects of the donation process. It has launched an investigation into Gallegos's case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All they care about is getting organs,' Neva Williams, a veteran intensive care nurse at the hospital, told the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/20/us/organ-transplants-donors-alive.html"&gt; Times&lt;/a&gt;. 'They’re so aggressive. It’s sickening.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New Mexico Donor Services has been contacted by Daily Mail for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The harrowing story emerged as mounting scrutiny has fallen on the organ donation industry amid allegations that it is rife with mistakes and abuse.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anthony Hoover was set to be removed from life support and his organs taken in 2021 when he suddenly woke up moments before. He suffered severe neurological injuries, but survived the ordeal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many such stories have emerged as hospitals increasingly turn to a type of organ removal called 'donation after circulatory death', where a patient is not deemed medically deceased but is not likely to ever recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These surgeries, which require permission from the patient's family, accounted for a third of all organ donations last year in the US, and triple the number from five years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The space of time between when a person is dead and when their organs are viable is short, meaning that the process can be subject to rushed decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Kentucky, a federal investigation this year found that the state's organ procurement organization had ignored signs of increasing consciousness among 73 donors, including a man whose organs were pursued even as he shook his head and pulled his knees up to his chest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think these types of problems are happening much more than we know,' Dr. Wade Smith, a longtime neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told the Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The organ harvesting industry was met with increased federal oversight last year following a shock hearing that included testimony from another near-miss patient, Anthony Hoover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Misty Hawkins, 42, spent weeks in a coma last year before her family decided to donate her organs, and doctors had already sawed into her breastplate when they discovered she was still alive &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hoover was set to be removed from life support and his organs taken in 2021 when he suddenly woke up moments before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He suffered severe neurological injuries, but survived the ordeal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His case led Kentucky authorities to put in place new policies to perform regular neurological testing on patients to scan for brain activity, and develop ways for clinicians to pause donations when they can see a patient is improving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Hoover was saved moments before he was removed from life support, the Times investigation found that another patient, Misty Hawkins, was only found to still be alive after doctors had already sawed into her chest.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawkins, 42, fell into a coma last year after choking while eating, and spent weeks in hospital before her mother was faced with the decision of taking her off life support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mother eventually decided to go ahead and donate her organs, and 103 minutes after Hawkins was taken off life support she was declared dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A surgeon sawed through her breastbone, only to discover that her heart was still beating and she appeared to be breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hawkins sadly passed a short time after her organ donation surgery was abruptly stopped &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hospital staff said that surgeons 'immediately stopped the procedure once they saw that the donor’s heart was beating', but Hawkins sadly passed away a short time later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said that while organ donation saves thousands of lives every year, the industry is rapidly expanding, meaning procurement organizations continually try and arrange more transplants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Health and Human Services Department has said in 2020 that the growing demand led it to begin grading procurement organizations based on how many organ donations they get each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some now say that this leads procurers to pressure doctors to operate on patients on the line between living and dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Robert Cannon, a transplant surgeon at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told the Times that he believes the industry has morphed into a vulnerable system where doctors are hesitant to speak out through fear that people could stop donating altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don’t know the scope of the problem. I don’t know that anybody does,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's the scary thing.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscles aches and shortness of breath. It’s treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can cause shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. About 10% of people who get Legionnaires’ &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;die from complications&lt;/a&gt; of their illness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it’s more dangerous for older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Around 6,000 Legionnaires’ disease cases are reported each year in the United States, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but reported totals may be lower than the actual cases in part because it can be difficult to distinguish Legionnaires’ disease from other types of pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Legionnaires’ disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscles aches and shortness of breath. It’s treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can cause shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. About 10% of people who get Legionnaires’ &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;die from complications&lt;/a&gt; of their illness, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it’s more dangerous for older adults and people with weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyxelu100083b6ovzn2bgy6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around 6,000 Legionnaires’ disease cases are reported each year in the United States, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, but reported totals may be lower than the actual cases in part because it can be difficult to distinguish Legionnaires’ disease from other types of pneumonia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

While most symptoms usually resolve within two weeks, the “debilitating” joint pain can persist for months or years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya#:~:text=The%20joint%20pain%20is%20often,%2C%20nausea%2C%20fatigue%20and%20rash." aria-label="World Health Organization."&gt;World Health Organization.&lt;/a&gt; The joint pain is the calling card of chikungunya and, without it, people with the virus can easily be misdiagnosed as having dengue or Zika, making it hard to know exactly how many people are infected. Chikungunya was first detected in southern Tanzania in the 1950s. The name comes from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania that means “that which bends up," meant to describe the contorted posture of people with severe joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Does Chikungunya Virus Spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya can only be transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected mosquito, but people can transmit it right back to the insect. So if a non-infected mosquito bites a person with the chikungunya, it can contract the virus and infect the next healthy person it bites. It is not contagious or transmittable person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Chikungunya Vaccine? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. There are two approved for use in the United States: IXCHIQ, a live-attenuated vaccine, is approved for people 18 and older and VIMKUNYA, a virus-like particle vaccine, is approved for those 12 and older. The CDC only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/vaccines/index.html" aria-label="recommends"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine to people traveling to an area with a chikungunya outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There Chikungunya Virus In The United States?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but it's not common. In the U.S., chikungunya is primarily found in travelers who've been infected in other countries and a locally acquired case hasn't been reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/chikungunya-us.html" aria-label="since 2019"&gt;since 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But travel-associated cases are on the rise. Chikungunya was rarely found in the U.S. before 2006, but as many as 28 people per year tested positive from 2006 to 2013. Nearly 3,000 travel-associated cases were identified in 2014 but that number steadily decreased down to 36 in 2021 before slowly climbing again. There were 199 cases found in 2024 and, in 2025, there have been 46 cases so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where Chikungunya Virus Most Commonly Found?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/data-maps/index.html" aria-label="warn"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; that U.S. travelers visiting Brazil, Columbia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines are at an elevated risk of exposure. The CDC also issued a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level2/chikungunya-china" aria-label="Level 2"&gt;Level 2&lt;/a&gt; travel alert for Foshan city, and recommends any traveler to the area be vaccinated. People who do visit are encouraged to prevent mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Pregnant women are advised not to travel to the region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What To Watch For&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More infections.

						&lt;p&gt;A North Carolina man is still &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/flesh-eating-bacteria-outer-banks-man-icu-nc-cases-august-2025/"&gt;fighting a serious bacterial
infection&lt;/a&gt; that landed him in an Outer Banks ICU for more than a week. His case is one
of a handful reported this year, drawing attention to a potentially deadly bacteria
found in coastal waters.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; is a flesh-eating bacterium that
can cause serious illness and lead to sepsis, shock, and large blisters that
destroy tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The bacteria live in brackish water – a mixture of fresh and
salt water. North Carolina is home to several areas where &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt;
could flourish near the coast, especially during warmer months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;An infection usually occurs in two ways: if someone has an
open wound and enters brackish water, or if someone eats contaminated raw
shellfish, usually oysters.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Infections are rare but can be fatal. About 1 in 5 people with
&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; will die, sometimes in as little as 1-2 days, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_population-people-at-risk"&gt;according
to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina has already reported one confirmed death from
&lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS data shows 59 total cases of Vibrio were reported
between January 1-July 31, 2025. Of them, 7 are confirmed &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt;
infections. &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Those at the highest risk of infection are those who:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Have cuts, scrapes or surgical wounds and go
into brackish water&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Have weakened immune systems &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Eat raw oysters or undercooked seafood&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;While longer, warmer seasons are allowing more bacteria to
grow, the average beachgoer’s risk remains low. For reference, roughly &lt;a href="https://www.outerbankschamber.com/main/north-carolina-s-outer-banks/"&gt;5
million people visit the Outer Banks&lt;/a&gt; every year, according to the Outer
Banks Chamber of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;NCDHHS State Veterinarian Carl Williams said he wants people
to know it’s still safe to go enjoy the beach, but it’s important to manage
risk of Vibrio infections. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Don’t be afraid to go,” Williams said. “Just know, like
anything, that every activity is probably going to have a certain amount of
risk associated with it. If you have a wound, cover it before you go into salt
water. If you sustain a wound while you’re in the water, come out and wash it.”
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state health expert explained &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; that
causes necrotizing fasciitis, as well as &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Parahaemolyticus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Alginolyticus&lt;/i&gt; that cause the food-borne illnesses, are all normal
inhabitants of a marine environment, like those found on North Carolina’s coast.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He added, “Our message to people is yes, they’re in the ocean
and the sounds, but they’re supposed to be there. You can take precautions to
make sure you don’t get infected.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People heading to the beach can take &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/prevention/index.html"&gt;these simple measures&lt;/a&gt;
to significantly reduce risk of vibrio infections:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Avoid eating raw or undercooked seafood&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Shower with soap after leaving the beach &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Cleaning cuts and wounds with hydrogen peroxide &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Cover wounds with waterproof bandages when
entering brackish water&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of a &lt;i&gt;Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; infection can occur
within 1 to 2 days. Health officials said early warning signs need to be taken
seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical
attention immediately:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Redness or swelling near a wound&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;·      
Skin blisters or pain&lt;/p&gt;

Semaglutide has demonstrated improvements in CV death, stroke and myocardial infarction.

The weight was just coming off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By the start of July, Eastburn had lost 15 lbs. “I felt better and that there was hope,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But then, her weight loss stalled: “I knew I had to do something drastic as I was desperate to look better. I didn't want to hate the wedding photos for the rest of my life,” Eastburn said. “I upped my dose so I could get to my goal of losing 20 lbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;https://people-app.onelink.me/HNIa/kz7l4cuf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn did not clarify whether she consulted with a doctor before increasing her dosage of Ozempic.

She said she ended up in the emergency room twice, struggling with nausea and “violent diarrhea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, she flew from Nashville to Orange County, Calif., on July 15 for the wedding — only to get so ill on the flight that once they landed, “an ambulance took me to the hospital straight away and I was diagnosed with a burst appendix.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A burst appendix is a medical emergency, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8095-appendicitis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and happens when the appendix becomes inflamed; When it bursts, it sends bacteria throughout your body, risking life-threatening complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn spent four days in the hospital, missing Chase’s rehearsal dinner. ”I just cried as I felt like it was my fault as I did this to myself. I missed all of this as I wanted to be thin and it broke my heart,” said Eastburn, who nearly missed the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We went at the very last minute as I was in so much pain. Sitting on a chair was so painful and I could barely walk. When my son saw me sitting in the front row, he came over and hugged me for the longest time and bawled like a baby,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We didn't think I was going to be at the wedding, much less live to tell anyone about it. I didn't care about my size as I was just so proud to be there. It was hard to stand and do the mother-son dance, but I was so grateful,” she said, sharing that while “I was so swollen and my stomach was so puffy,” her weight “was the last thing on my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News &amp;amp; Media &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ali Eastburn (here, with her son Chase) took medication to lose weight for his wedding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eastburn claimed the medication caused her health struggle; There have been sporadic case &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10959081/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that suggest appendicitis could be a potential risk, but there has been no direct link established between the medication and the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I will never jeopardize or endanger myself again with any drugs to lose weight as that was too close of a call,” Eastburn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I would say think long and hard before taking a GLP-1 as it almost killed me," she claimed.

    &lt;p&gt;A newborn baby from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts is fighting for her life at a Boston hospital after preliminary tests show she contracted &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/powassan-virus-sharon-massachusetts-ticks/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Powassan virus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a rare but serious tick-borne disease that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/ticks-massachusetts-powassan-virus/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;can be fatal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, local health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lily Sisco was flown to Massachusetts General Hospital just weeks after she was born, her mother Tiffany Sisco said. She said Lily had a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tick-bites-how-to-spot-get-rid-of/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "the size of a needle tip" on her after a short walk on the West Tisbury bike path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She is still fighting daily at MGH and continuing to leave the doctors speechless with her progress," Sisco &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tiffany.lynn.9003/posts/pfbid02HjHUURrsoUGoWhDnqMDe9N3ccmig2n63QU1jzno6gVmwzr1vK2cgovodS4XsHLWjl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;wrote on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend. "Although the CDC,  Neurological Doctors and Nurses have no answers for long term, we remain hopeful and extremely blessed that she is still alive today and continuing to progress in the right direction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Powassan virus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martha's Vineyard health officials &lt;a href="https://www.capecod.gov/2025/08/05/press-release-rare-but-serious-tick-borne-virus-investigated-on-marthas-vineyard/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Monday that they are investigating a case of Powassan. This would be only the second confirmed case of the virus on the island in the past two decades. They said three other cases have been confirmed elsewhere in Massachusetts by the Centers for Disease Control so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were just 57 cases nationwide in 2024, and 24 cases so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powassan is transmitted by deer ticks, and it's estimated that between 1% and 2% of deer ticks on Martha's Vineyard are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no treatment for Powassan, which can cause brain inflammation or meningitis. Many people who are exposed to the virus may not even know they were infected, but older adults and children are considered to be at high risk. It is deadly in about 10% of cases, and survivors may suffer from long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tufts Medical Center Chief Infection Control Officer Dr. Shira Doron said what makes the virus so dangerous, compared to other tick-borne illnesses, is that it can infect a person within 15 minutes of a bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very, very quickly, sort of right away," Dr. Doron said. "And then we don't have that what we call post exposure, prophylaxis, or the ability to give a drug that will prevent that infection from happening." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sisco said Lily was flown to the hospital after a persistent fever, and her symptoms progressed to seizures. The inflammation is causing scarring in her brain, Sisco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We certainly had no idea a 20 minute walk on the West Tisbury bike path beside our home, a walk we do most every day, could potentially cause my child her life," Sisco said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing tick bites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/new-england-worst-tick-season-5-years/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;bad tick season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the area. The CDC said earlier this summer that emergency room visits for tick bites in the Northeast are at their highest levels in at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ticks are most active during the warm weather months, but can be outside any time the temperature is above freezing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not common for babies who don't walk to get tick-borne illnesses in general," Dr. Doron said. "This was really an unfortunate situation. Obviously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent tick bites, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health recommends using insect repellent, wearing long, light-colored clothing, and staying on trails when walking. Experts also say to check yourself, children and pets for ticks after being outside in an area where ticks might be present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Please, please, please check yourselves, your children and your pets," Sisco said.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found what they dubbed a “sex-related gap” in the use of DMTs between women and men with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) with disease onset between the ages of 18 and 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, the team called for both clinicians and patients to be “educated on the most recent recommendations on the use of DMTs,” specifically “in the context of pregnancy,” to prevent this inequity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandra Vukusic, MD, PhD, a study author from the University of Lyon, noted that “when used early, MS drugs can delay the burden of the disease.” Thus, “women who are not treated could have worse outcomes in the long term and an increased risk of long-term disability,” Vukusic said in an &lt;a href="https://aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5274"&gt;American Academy of Neurology press release&lt;/a&gt; outlining the study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This loss of chance is not acceptable anymore, as there are drugs that are compatible with pregnancy or can continue to fight the disease long after people stop them when they are trying to conceive,”  Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213907"&gt;Sex-Related Gap in the Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS occurs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; when the immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin sheath that serves as a protective coating around nerve fibers, ensuring the efficient transmission of electric signals in the body. The disease is most commonly diagnosed in young adults and women. In fact, being a woman is one of the strongest risk factors for developing the disease, data have shown.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-treatment/"&gt;Treatment approaches for MS&lt;/a&gt; have markedly evolved in recent years, most notably with the introduction of various DMTs. Evidence shows that access to high-efficacy DMTs early on in the disease is more effective at preventing long-term disability progression than not using such treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Women 20% less likely than men to receive highly effective DMTs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a research team from institutions across France sought to assess if and how a person’s sex affects access to DMTs. To that end, the team retrospectively analyzed health records from people with RRMS that had started between patients were ages 18 to 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis included data from 16,857 women and 5,800 men, with a mean age of 29, who were followed for a median of 11.6 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings indicated that women with RRMS were less likely to receive a DMT than men with the disease. Data specifically showed that the percentage of person-years that study patients received a DMT was lower for women than it was for men (60.2% vs. 61.3%). The same was true for highly effective DMTs (23.5% vs. 25.3%). Person-years is a unit that measures the amount of time a group of people has been observed; it is calculated by taking the number of people being studied and multiplying it by the number of years they were followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because women tend to have more active disease, and also are often advised to halt treatment during pregnancy or postpartum, the researchers reanalyzed the data after making adjustments for these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The differences were found to persist, with women having an 8% lower chance of receiving a DMT compared with men. In the case of highly effective DMTs, analysis showed that women were 20% less likely than men to receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We found that women were less likely to be treated with a disease-modifying drug than men with the same level of disease severity, even when we took into account people who stopped taking their drugs during pregnancy or postpartum,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These sex-related differences became evident two years after disease onset for DMTs and one year for highly effective DMTs, and did not differ significantly according to patients’ age, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Study found certain treatments significantly underused by women&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain treatments were significantly underused in women, the researchers found. Among them were teriflunomide (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/aubagio-teriflunomide-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Aubagio&lt;/a&gt;), as well as sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulators — a class of DMTs that include fingolimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/gilenya-fingolimod-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Gilenya&lt;/a&gt;), siponimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/mayzent-siponimod"&gt;Mayzent&lt;/a&gt;), ponesimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ponvory-ponesimod-relapsing-rrms/"&gt;Ponvory&lt;/a&gt;), and ozanimod (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/zeposia-ozanimod/"&gt;Zeposia&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also significantly underused by women were CD20 inhibitors, such as ocrelizumab (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ocrevus-ocrelizumab-primary-progressive-relapsing-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Ocrevus&lt;/a&gt;), the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interferon-based medications and natalizumab (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/tysabri-natalizumab-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Tysabri&lt;/a&gt;) were initially less used by women, but then became equally used by both female and male patients after some time. Interestingly, glatiramer acetate (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/copaxone-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Copaxone&lt;/a&gt;) and fumarate therapies, such as dimethyl fumarate (sold as &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/tecfidera-dimethyl-fumarate-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Tecfidera&lt;/a&gt;), were initially equally used by patients of both sexes, but then became more frequently used by women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Anticipation of pregnancy was probably an important factor in this difference between women and men with MS, but there could also be a reluctance to use these treatments when they may actually be the best way to manage the disease and delay disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses also showed that among the 5,268 women who had a child, the proportion of those given DMTs started to decline 18 months before childbirth, from 42.6% to 27.9% at the estimated time of conception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anticipation of pregnancy was probably an important factor in this difference between women and men with MS, but there could also be a reluctance to use these treatments when they may actually be the best way to manage the disease and delay disability,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other factors also may have played a role, according to Vukusic, such a lag in both clinicians and patients learning about the established safety of new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Another factor could be that new data continues to be collected on the safety of newer MS drugs, so more work is needed to communicate those findings to people with MS and their doctors,” Vukusic said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings show a gap, by sex, in the use of DMTs by patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, these results highlight the need to educate both neurologists and patients on the latest guidelines for DMT use, particularly among women in their childbearing years, “to avoid deleterious therapeutic inertia.”&lt;/p&gt;

While cancer tends to strike later in life, when most patients in treatment are receiving Medicare benefits, a cancer diagnosis can pose an undue financial burden on younger people with private insurance, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those out-of-pocket costs highlight the need for policy reform, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research "underscores the need for policies such as paid sick leave that address both insurance continuity and financial assistance, especially for patients with more advanced cancer," the report states. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out-of-pocket costs increased based on a patient's cancer progression, the analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with stage 0 cancer saw their costs rise by $462 per month compared to non-cancer patients, while stage 4 cancer cost people with private insurance an additional $719.97 per month in out of pocket costs. Costs rise as the disease progresses because patients typically require more treatment during cancer's later stages, leading to greater medical expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This result seems straightforward; later-stage disease is associated with more intensive workup and treatment that can drive higher medical expenditures," the report states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed medical claims records from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry to compare the out-of-pocket costs of privately insured individuals under the age of 65 who were diagnosed with breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, to those without cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

                FALLS CHURCH, Va.   –  
            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;
            Are you a TRICARE beneficiary taking a drug for weight loss—such as a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/FAQs/Pharmacy/PharmProg_Wegovy"&gt;GLP-1 medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; like Zepbound or Wegovy? Do you have questions about what’s covered—and why?

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the difference between TRICARE plans and coverage is key to knowing what to expect when filling your &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/pharmacy"&gt;prescription&lt;/a&gt;. There are different rules about how TRICARE covers these drugs based on your plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People are taking GLP-1 drugs—like Wegovy and Zepbound—for weight loss now more than ever,” said Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Paul Cordts. “It’s important to understand how—and why—TRICARE covers these drugs, based on your condition and status.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dha.mil/" target="_blank"&gt;Defense Health Agency&lt;/a&gt; is implementing regulatory controls on weight loss medication coverage. These controls take effect &lt;strong&gt;Aug. 31, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, these medications are still covered in certain circumstances. Otherwise, if you have an approved &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy/priorauth"&gt;prior authorization&lt;/a&gt; for weight loss drugs, it’s no longer valid. You’ll need to see your provider to discuss your options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your weight loss drug isn’t covered, you should speak with your provider about other options. These may include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your provider can work with you to explore all options and determine the best approach for your health needs. Talk to your provider. You can also visit &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/HealthWellness"&gt;Health and Wellness&lt;/a&gt; for more details on resources that can help you reach your goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re affected, you’ll get a notice in the mail in the coming weeks. Read below to learn more about which groups are affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
TRICARE only covers weight loss medications for certain beneficiary groups. Coverage depends on your condition and certain criteria.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;TRICARE covers weight loss medications, including Saxenda, Wegovy, Zepbound, Qsymia, Phentermine or Contrave, for weight loss if:
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’re enrolled in &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/prime"&gt;TRICARE Prime&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/Plans/HealthPlans/TS"&gt;TRICARE Select&lt;/a&gt;, or get these benefits from a premium-based plan. Premium-based plans include:

  
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You meet TRICARE’s clinical criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have a prescription from a TRICARE network provider.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your provider submits a &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/CoveredServices/Pharmacy/FillPrescriptions/PreAuthMedical"&gt;prior authorization&lt;/a&gt; form.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;TRICARE covers Trulicity, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Victoza to treat &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tricare.mil/News/TRICARE-News/Article/3311965/have-diabetes-check-supplies-services-tricare-covers"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Coverage requires:
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior authorization&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Victoza require medical necessity forms for a formulary copayment and coverage at a military pharmacy.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those &lt;strong&gt;excluded&lt;/strong&gt; from weight loss medication coverage are those who have &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/tfl"&gt;TRICARE For Life&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/FAQs/General/DC_DirectCareStatus"&gt;direct care only&lt;/a&gt; access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://www.express-scripts.com/frontend/open-enrollment/tricare/fst/#/" target="_blank"&gt;TRICARE Formulary Search Tool&lt;/a&gt; to check your drug’s coverage. Also, be sure to &lt;a href="https://tricare.mil/CoveredServices/Pharmacy/FillPrescriptions/PreAuthMedical"&gt;download prior authorization forms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; GLP-1s for the treatment of diabetes continue to be covered for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy/priorauth"&gt;medically necessary&lt;/a&gt; and when &lt;a href="https://www.tricare.mil/pharmacy/priorauth"&gt;prior authorization&lt;/a&gt; requirements are met. Existing cost-shares for these medications haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember:&lt;/strong&gt; Use the &lt;a href="https://www.express-scripts.com/frontend/open-enrollment/tricare/fst/#/" target="_blank"&gt;TRICARE Formulary Search Tool&lt;/a&gt; to check costs and coverage requirements. Also, talk to your provider to confirm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Your drug’s indication&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you’ll need prior authorization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthy habits are key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Are you currently taking a drug for weight loss? Remember: Forming healthy habits is crucial to maintaining a healthy weight. These can include:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Eating a balanced diet&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Exercising&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Cutting back on alcohol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;
TRICARE covers weight loss medication drugs (including GLP-1s) when you meet certain criteria, based on diagnosis, medical necessity, and your TRICARE plan. Talk to your provider about other options or to confirm coverage for your prescription.

						A Massachusetts mother has identified her newborn daughter as the possible case of Powassan virus that is under investigation by health officials on Martha's Vineyard. Health officials did not disclose where on the island the patient lives, their age or when they were infected. The virus has not been confirmed. Tiffany Sisco said her daughter, Lilly, had seizures and is receiving intensive care, including antibiotics, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  The family is awaiting the final testing results.Tiffany Sisco and her husband, Marcus, said shortly after the baby was born, they took her for a walk along a bike path in West Tisbury, with Lilly in a stroller covered by a blanket. Upon returning home, Tiffany discovered a tiny, pencil-head-sized tick on Lilly's ankle."I picked it off and I called him in and said, 'What do we do?' Because he's more familiar with them being a landscaper. And he said, 'Just throw it away. And we'll monitor her and make sure she doesn't get a rash, a bull's eye, anything like that. Like a week later she started getting a fever of 102. I said, 'I'm taking her right in,'" Tiffany Sisco said.For the first few days, Lilly needed help breathing, and her parents were unable to hold her. Doctors were uncertain if she would survive. The family now hopes to leave the hospital within a week. Tests indicate some signs of brain damage, but doctors are unsure how it may impact Lilly's development.Aside from the pending investigation, there has only been one case of Powassan virus on the island in the past 20 years. Three cases elsewhere in the state have been confirmed this year, officials said.Powassan is a rare but potentially serious virus transmitted by the bite of infected Ixodes scapularis ticks — commonly known as deer ticks. Unlike other tick-borne pathogens, Powassan virus can be transmitted within 15 minutes of a tick bite. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 2004 to 2024, there were 397 Powassan cases nationally with 50 deaths, with almost half of those infections occurring in the last five years.Massachusetts ranks second behind Minnesota in total number of cases in that same time frame, with 71, according to the CDC.So far in 2025, there have been 24 cases in seven states, with three of those recorded in Massachusetts, according to the CDC.There is no specific treatment, vaccine or cure for Powassan virus disease. Severe cases can cause brain swelling, encephalitis, confusion, seizures and long-term neurological complications."The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare," said Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor with longstanding research on Martha’s Vineyard. Telford’s lab has tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024. "Between 1 and 2% of nymph deer ticks on Martha’s Vineyard are infected. This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected," Telford said.Top tips to prevent tick bites:    Treat your clothing and gear with permethrin.    Dress “tick-smart” — tuck pants into socks, shirts into pants, wear light-colored clothes to spot ticks more easily.        Leggings and snug-fitting clothing can prevent ticks from reaching the skin. Use a lint roller on your clothing after coming in from the outdoors to remove "hitchhikers."        Change clothes or shower soon after being outside.        Put clothes in the dryer on high for 20 minutes to kill ticks.

"People are buying and installing these systems in homes and schools hoping to protect themselves and their families but the science hasn't caught up to the marketing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only 8% included human participants &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the 672 studies on a total of 1,073 interventions, 90% evaluated environmental samples only, only 8% included human participants, and 1% were based on sentinel animals. No studies reported pregnant women, fetus health, or postpartum populations. A total of 60% of studies analyzed at least one intervention classified as pathogen inactivation, with 30% involving pathogen removal or air exchange or dilution, and 21% on air exchange or dilution. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In total, 51 were observational studies, and six were randomized controlled trials. Studies were from all six World Health Organization regions, including the Americas (41%), Europe (25%), and the Western Pacific (25%). Three studies were from Africa.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most environmental studies were conducted in scaled or full-sized chambers. Other common settings were real-world or simulated healthcare facilities, schools, other workplaces, transportation conveyances, and residential buildings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of all studies, 49% measured viable harmless microbes from air samples, followed by nonbiological particulate matter (eg, tracer gases, dust; 29%), and disease-causing viruses or bacteria (22%). Potential lung irritants (eg, ozone) that can be produced by ionizers, plasma-based technologies, and some UV systems were measured only rarely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No studies measured quality of life or functioning, sustainability (eg, carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions), or economic analysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Funding statements were unclear or unreported in 23% of studies. Of those with funding statements, 30% had multiple funding types. Most (66%) reported government funding. Conflict of interest (COI) statements were absent or unclear in 45%. In 291 studies, no authors included a COI statement. In the remaining 77 studies, 40% reported at least one COI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research on real-world health outcomes needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We were surprised to find that most of the research tested air cleaning devices in lab chambers, not in real-world settings where people live, work or go to school," Lisa Bero, PhD, of UC, said in the release. "We need stronger studies that look at actual health outcomes, whether people are actually exposed to fewer pathogens or get sick less often, and not just measurements of particles in the air."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coauthor Louis Leslie, of UC, said, "Ozone and other chemicals created by some air-cleaning devices can actually harm the respiratory system, especially in children or people with chronic respiratory illnesses."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be able to fully fund the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/php/od2a/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Overdose Data to Action or OD2A program&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a key budget deadline, according to a CDC senior leader. A second CDC staff member confirmed that "there have been developments and we are likely to have full funding," although they did not have details on when the funding would become available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity because they fear retribution for speaking to the press without authorization. Some staffers at CDC expressed to NPR that this appeared to be good news, although the funding situation was still fluid and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR reported last month that the Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5468535/fentanyl-trump-addiction-funding" target="_blank"&gt;was withholding $140 million&lt;/a&gt; from the OD2A program, which state and local public health departments rely on to lower overdose deaths from fentanyl, methamphetamines and other drugs across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Previously frozen funding for other CDC programs, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/08/nx-s1-5349529/hhs-layoffs-sexual-assault-rape-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;rape and domestic violence prevention&lt;/a&gt;, is also getting released, the senior CDC leader said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Funding, 30 days at a time&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The delays were part of a broader issue with funding at CDC. As NPR &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;reported in June&lt;/a&gt;, for months, CDC waited for the $9 billion Congress intended for the agency for fiscal year 2025. In the meantime, it received small amounts of money every 30 days to cover payroll and other limited expenses.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The senior leader described the process like receiving money "with an eyedropper."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without a pot of money to distribute out to various centers and divisions, the CDC couldn't send out the notice of awards that state and local health departments need to be able to do their work and know they will be reimbursed for it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Most state health departments get most of their funding from the feds — in Alabama's case, we get more than two thirds of our funding from federal grants, predominantly CDC," Dr. Scott Harris, who runs Alabama's health department, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;told NPR in June&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Deadlines missed &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health departments across the country sounded the alarm as deadlines approached or passed for CDC funding of HIV prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/cdc-cuts-threaten-cancer-screening-state-level-tracking-for-emerging-threats/" target="_blank"&gt;cancer registries&lt;/a&gt; and overdose prevention programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, most of those programs across CDC apparently can continue, including OD2A. Grantees for the OD2A program, who had been told in July they would be receiving only half of their funding, will soon be told they will receive the full amount, according to the senior leader at CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news comes after advocates had been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/16/nx-s1-5468535/fentanyl-trump-addiction-funding" target="_blank"&gt;warning for weeks&lt;/a&gt; of the harms that delayed or partial funding to the program could have. If full funding is actually coming, "it'll be welcome, but it's not without the toll that it's already taken," says &lt;a href="https://www.safestates.org/page/SharonGilmartin" target="_blank"&gt;Sharon Gilmartin&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Safe States Alliance, a public health advocacy group. For instance, NPR reported on a local health department in North Carolina that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/28/nx-s1-5442689/cdc-trump-layoffs-public-health-rescission" target="_blank"&gt;laid off staff&lt;/a&gt; because of CDC funding delays, only to have the funding come through weeks late without explanation. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I don't think anybody will feel confident until they have money in hand," Gilmartin adds. "And I'll be honest, I think the concern is that — if this is what we went through this year, even if funding comes through, are we going to be doing this again next year?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was no available explanation from the Trump administration or the Office for Management and Budget for the delays or the release of the funding. OMB and the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC senior leader describes the release of funding for the agency as a relief. "It's great we have our apportionment," they tell NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Some funds frozen&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there's a new funding challenge. Several dozen specific CDC programs have now had their budget lines frozen at the direction of OMB, according to the senior leader at CDC. The news of the frozen funds was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-cdc-funding-freeze-79e7090f" target="_blank"&gt;by the Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The frozen programs are mostly in the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, according to the senior leader at CDC. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A list of frozen programs reviewed by NPR includes those that address tobacco use, nutrition, physical activity and obesity, school health, inflammatory bowel disease, excessive alcohol use, chronic disease education and awareness, national diabetes prevention program, oral health, epilepsy, and more.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"What does it all mean?"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Funding for five programs at the CDC's Injury Center was frozen by OMB as well, including youth violence prevention, adverse childhood experiences, firearm injury, injury control research centers, and injury prevention activities. Gilmartin of the Safe States Alliance says it's hard to understand why these programs were targeted. "I can't come up with an ideological reason why you would want to cut funding that supports positive early childhood," for instance, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The senior leader at CDC says there are some big questions for OMB and the Trump administration: "How do we interpret all of this? What does it all mean?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There were whole teams fired during the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/05/g-s1-58312/hhs-layoffs-rif-cdc-fda-nih" target="_blank"&gt;dramatic reduction in force&lt;/a&gt; across HHS in April that appear to have full funding, the senior leader says, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sexual-violence/programs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Rape Prevention and Education&lt;/a&gt; Program. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Similarly, there are programs with their budget lines frozen by OMB that are fully staffed, and still other priorities set forth in President Trump's 2026 budget, they say, which leaves the impression that there's no overarching strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Using eye-tracking and EEG during a visual task, researchers found that attention-related brain regions ramp up when we focus on potential rewards, but only when it boosts sensitivity—not bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, decision bias—our tendency to say “yes” or “no” based on reward—didn’t show activity in the brain’s attention centers at all. These findings uncover distinct reward-related pathways that shape how we see and decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Split Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Reward expectations influence sensitivity and bias via separate brain circuits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attention vs. Decision:&lt;/strong&gt; Sensitivity engages visual attention areas; bias does not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights may help inform treatments for impulsivity, gambling, and addiction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;IISC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever noticed how animals instinctively choose the ripest fruits in a tree? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This behaviour, of seeking out the most rewarding option, offers a fascinating glimpse into the workings of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animals not only focus their attention on the most rewarding target (the location of the ripest fruit), but they also make a rapid decision to act on that information. Interestingly, the behavioural and neural mechanisms underlying this process are relatively underexplored.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112088"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain surrounded by fruits." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/reward-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers strategically rigged the rewards – the number of reward points was fixed on one side, whereas the points varied on the other side; in other words, it could be higher or lower than the fixed side. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sridharan Devarajan, Associate Professor at the Centre for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and his PhD student Ankita Sengupta took up the task to investigate how the expectation of a reward influences attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology &lt;/em&gt;offers fresh insights into this complex process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that the promise of a reward guides and dictates behaviour. People are quicker to detect changes, and respond faster and more accurately when they expect a reward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many previous studies have investigated how the expectation of a reward influences attention and decision-making. But where they fell short is in differentiating whether these processes are governed by the same or different regions and processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Sridharan and Sengupta designed an experiment to examine how the expectation of a reward modulates the two key components of attention: sensitivity (the ability to visually identify the ripest fruit) and bias (the decision to act to pick out the ripest fruit). Researchers have often struggled to tease apart the impact of reward on sensitivity and bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sridharan’s team conducted trials with 24 participants, each performing a two-part cognitive task. The first part tested for reward effects on sensitivity. The participant looks at a screen displaying two Gabor patches (smooth black-and-white stripes used in attention research), one on each side of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a very brief pause (200 milliseconds), the patches flicker, and one (or both) of the patch orientations might change. Participants have to report if they detected a change in one of the two patches. For each trial that they reported the change accurately, they received a monetary reward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where the task got interesting. The researchers strategically rigged the rewards – the number of reward points was fixed on one side, whereas the points varied on the other side; in other words, it could be higher or lower than the fixed side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants would realise this during the task, based on the points received, leading them to focus on and be more sensitive to minute changes on the side that would get them greater rewards.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second part tested for reward effects on bias. The only difference in this case was that the points for reporting a “Yes” option (deciding a change occurred), relative to a “No” option (deciding no change occurred) were varied on one side; as before, this reward could be higher or lower than the fixed side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, participants would be biased to choose the Yes option when it was more rewarding than the No option, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the tasks, the researchers measured the participants’ eye movements and brain activity, and quantified the two components of attention.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first task, where sensitivity was being examined, participants paid more attention, and their gaze was drawn towards the side associated with greater rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, their decisional bias didn’t change, indicating that only sensitivity was modulated in this task,” explains Sridharan. Moreover, well-known brain signatures of attention, including electrical responses and oscillations, signalled higher sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the second part of the task, where bias was examined, the researchers observed that participants were more likely (biased) to choose the option (yes/no) with the higher expected reward. But during this task, the researchers were surprised to notice that none of the participants’ gaze or brain patterns matched those associated with attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unexpectedly, changing bias did not result in any signatures specific to the attention centres in the brain,” says Sengupta.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s results show, for the first time, that sensitivity and bias may be governed by separate neural mechanisms under the hood, each tuned differently by the anticipation of a reward. Moreover, while sensitivity seems to be closely linked to sensory attention centres, bias may be more closely linked to decision-making centres of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also has practical implications for understanding how we learn and make decisions in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies such as ours will help design tasks to understand risk-taking propensities in individuals, when faced with uncertain rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings may help to design treatments for addiction behaviours, such as gambling, which involve a complex interplay of reward, attention, and impulsive decisions,” adds Sridharan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this reward, attention, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6516170c010d0417250c0c16064b04064b0c0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sridharan Devarajan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IISC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sridharan Devarajan – IISC&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reward expectation yields distinct effects on sensory processing and decision making in the human brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Sridharan Devarajan et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward expectation yields distinct effects on sensory processing and decision making in the human brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reward expectation robustly guides both attention and decisions. Yet, whether common or distinct mechanisms mediate each of these processes remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have often conflated the effect of reward expectation on sensory processing and decision-making because locations selected for sensory prioritization (sensitivity effects) were also prioritized for decisions (criterion effects).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we identify distinct forms of reward expectation that separably control spatial attention and decisional biases in human cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity and criterion were independently modulated when expected rewards varied across locations (“space-specific”) or choices (“choice-specific”), respectively. Only sensitivity, not criterion, modulations reflected a limited, conserved attentional resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Established neural and physiological signatures of attention, including gain modulation of event-related potentials, alpha-band power lateralization, and eye-movement biases, were elicited only by space-specific reward modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, neural correlates of decisional biases, including pre-stimulus alpha power suppression, selectively accompanied choice-specific reward modulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attention-related neural markers predicted sensitivity modulation by space-specific reward expectation but not criterion modulation by choice-specific reward expectation, indicating their distinct underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings uncover fundamentally dissociable behavioral and neural underpinnings of reward expectation effects on sensory and decisional selection, with critical implications for understanding how reward, attention, and choice are linked in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 18:32:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE01LVVTMFRnOHpEbFZQYjhzOWc5bEtrVlhwaGhMYzc0UnhpVDMyTm9uckk0OFNRcmp0VjFRcy1CamxnVFM5YjZzQjB4OEtmQ05tSk1HN19iaHl6c0JkbTJTTDB4aVpoZHBTaVZYZmtEckpUWTQ</guid></item><item><title>化合物可能有助于治疗某些神经系统疾病-美国国立卫生研究院（ NIH ） | (.gov)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNcFVMVW95QVJaTnZEWlRlaUYyaGxZUGE2MTVZbFgwWGFGUUxkcHpxY2pyWG0ycXN1N19PT1F2a2ZMU2dZRUtYV3FiMjZpbTVkRFYwQ0VPTV9yR1RQbi1IYkNfbEhSajczdjVhM1BnTmk3SzhKbTdZdmQwQVlLZXNGb1NIWW5yOG9vNkJ3ZmNVdVhEdkx1U1VEZUF6ZDhXdnJZbHhaYXBmYUZyMVNV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="usa-media-block__body"&gt;

It’s possible they had a mild fever and a little rash and never sought the medical care that would have added their case &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;to a map&lt;/a&gt; kept by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s also possible that the virus was shed by someone traveling through from Montana, Washington, Canada or elsewhere. Maybe they went back to their hometown in another state and got tested and reported there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to know for sure, Hahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two states neighboring Idaho’s panhandle have each reported &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;10-49 cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year, according to the CDC. But Idaho has had zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wastewater detection won’t be translated into reporting a case,” Hahn said by phone. “Right now, we really can’t say if this indicates one person or more than one person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dashboard for WastewaterSCAN, a national wastewater monitoring system based at Stanford University, first reported measles in wastewater treated at the Coeur d’Alene Water Resource Recovery Facility on July 29. Then, on July 31, it reported &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CjUQASABSABSBjEwNTZmMFIGY2QwODhiUgZlNTk1ODVaB01lVl9Sb3l4KooBBmQxNDg5MMABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=d14890"&gt;higher levels&lt;/a&gt; of the virus in that wastewater. Still, the level of measles in the wastewater is marked as low: Two out of five samples in the 10 days prior to the last sample date were positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many communities in the state don’t even do that kind of testing, Hahn said. The city of Boise, which treats wastewater for itself, Garden City and Eagle, hasn’t detected the disease, according to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CjUQASABSABSBjEwNTZmMFIGY2QwODhiUgZlNTk1ODVaB01lVl9Sb3l4KooBBmQxNDg5MMABAQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=d14890"&gt;the dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. It is the only other community in the state that tests its wastewater for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus found in Coeur d’Alene’s wastewater is a wild type, a label used to distinguish between measles that is naturally occurring and the diminished form of measles in the vaccine, Hahn explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You may be aware that the measles vaccine is a weakened, live virus,” Hahn said. “So if you get your measles shot, you might actually shed a little bit of that virus into the sewer system, and that would just show up as a vaccine strain, not as a wild type.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said people should consider checking whether they’re protected, especially parents who are gearing up to send their children back to school or people planning to go on a trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine for measles is very effective because it offers, in most cases, lifetime protection, Hahn said. Children are recommended to get two doses, once when they turn 1-year-old and once before they start kindergarten, at about age 4 or 5. Boosters aren’t needed. But if you can’t remember if you were previously vaccinated, it doesn’t hurt to get the two doses again just to be sure, Hahn said. Or, you could get blood drawn and an antibody test that will tell you whether you’re immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe those old immunization records are still hanging around somewhere in a drawer, and you can double check,” Hahn said. “If you’re going to go and international travel, or you are a health care worker, it is recommended that you have documentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Idaho has imperfect data, but according to the annual National Immunization Survey, nearly 80% of kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year were vaccinated, leaving about 20% unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374862"&gt; might have measles&lt;/a&gt;, or have been exposed to someone with measles, and develop a fever or rash, public health officials recommend staying home, isolating yourself from others and calling your doctor or a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles has been surging nationwide. The CDC reported on Tuesday the highest number of annual &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; since the U.S. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/well/measles-doctors-treatment.html"&gt;declared measles eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. Most of the cases are connected to an outbreak that began in a Mennonite community in West Texas and spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the Texas and New Mexico cases have been among people who are unvaccinated, according to the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater testing is a valuable public health tool because it can detect the presence of infectious diseases, like measles, before cases are even reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like it’s a signal,” Hahn said. “Measles is very contagious, and so the wastewater itself is just our canary in the coal mine, as it were, telling us that measles is in the community. It’s just one more reminder that measles is still out there circulating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;August 5, 2025 at 11:27 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

(WLOS) — &lt;/span&gt;Health officials confirm an investigation is underway after a person with a confirmed case of tuberculosis (TB) spent time in Jackson County during their infectious period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Aug. 5, 2025, news release, the Jackson County Department of Public Health (JCDPH) said it is working with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Division of Public Health on the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the TB diagnosis was confirmed, county officials said they took immediate steps to protect the public, including isolating and treating the infected individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/back-to-school/13th-whooping-cough-case-confirmed-haywood-county-health-human-services-pertussis-prevention-vaccine-centers-disease-control" target="_blank" title="https://wlos.com/news/back-to-school/13th-whooping-cough-case-confirmed-haywood-county-health-human-services-pertussis-prevention-vaccine-centers-disease-control" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;13TH WHOOPING COUGH CASE CONFIRMED IN HAYWOOD COUNTY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detailed contact investigation is also underway to identify people who may have been exposed to the disease. Jackson County officials said those identified as having close contact with the TB case will be notified directly by a public health official and offered testing, education, and follow-up care at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our priority is the health and well-being of everyone in Jackson County," Public Health Director Anna Lippard said. "We are working carefully to identify and support those who may have been exposed, and we're committed to keeping the community informed every step of the way. If you have not been contacted directly by the health department, there is no need to seek testing at this time."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TB is a serious disease, county officials say it is treatable and the risk to the general public remains low. Those with questions or concerns are asked to contact the JCDPH at 828-586-8994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/haywood-county-deputy-bitten-dogs-attack-unvaccinated-rabies-vaccinations-animal-services-incident-shelter-citation-fines-offense-community-pets-safety-precaution-cats-ferrets" target="_blank" title="https://wlos.com/news/local/haywood-county-deputy-bitten-dogs-attack-unvaccinated-rabies-vaccinations-animal-services-incident-shelter-citation-fines-offense-community-pets-safety-precaution-cats-ferrets" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;HAYWOOD COUNTY DEPUTY BITTEN BY UNVACCINATED DOGS, RABIES VACCINATIONS STRESSED&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;About tuberculosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;provisional report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, the number of tuberculosis (TB) cases in the country has been increasing since 2021. The report stated there were 10,347 TB cases in the U.S. in 2024, up from 9,633 cases in 2023. North Carolina followed the nationwide trend, with 215 cases reported in 2023 and 250 cases in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active cases of tuberculosis often affect the lungs and spread through the air when coughing, speaking, or singing. It is not spread through casual contact, like touching surfaces, shaking hands, or sharing food or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson County officials said those sick with TB often have one or more of these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough lasting more than 3 weeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coughing up blood&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Profuse sweating at night, often soaking the bed sheets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unintentional weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/prevention/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;CDC.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for more information on the disease and prevention measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:07:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwJBVV95cUxPRzZFTlU5NzJydFIxNTFNb3ctZ0FGOV85NmpYVXlENnB0NlhxQWVqY1JBa3dWRW1FbU45bFN0aGdCWjR4anFiUHdDSmpjVlJJYnRXTnA2c3ZUTWhQWWpVS3g5eHhKZXJ4R29sY3Q1MkxUSEpqemFyRWVtMGhjTnMtWXY0ZVdPcm5xdUl5Y2M2dTF2bVZGdkExM2F5VThTQWU4NWR4NjNLLWFyNHQwZW9MME92ZklSS0o5WDJRSGRhLURHWW5yZHZMRzFqN2E3R3pHNW9ONjN0OU05WGxtVUljODFrbWVQY1N0UmFnR0dPdUtNa2VDYjNmejc3QmVaa3pPbmp0d1hUZldabjZPem0zY1pkSFo0S0h5YlFv</guid></item><item><title>夏季COVID-19感染最严重的地方：阿拉巴马州的坏消息- AL.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W43EX56IP5DI7F5UPNQFDVFMRY"&gt;Alabama is among a handful of states with a high level of COVID-19 virus in the sewage system, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_2-weekly-national-summary" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_2-weekly-national-summary"&gt;according to data the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; released Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NGQEHWUEENBAZIQ2U7OIHK2WYY"&gt;Scientists test wastewater to determine the prevalence of infections, aiming to capture those who may or may not be symptomatic or visit the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VFUV3AFTJFARPGTNQFCS6SHFDY"&gt;While for most of the country, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5435181-covid-19-emergency-visits-increase/?tbref=hp" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5435181-covid-19-emergency-visits-increase/?tbref=hp"&gt;wastewater viral activity level for coronavirus is currently&lt;/a&gt; low, Alabama is one of seven states where it is high.

            For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/pakistan" target="_blank"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-vaccine-gaza-baby-225d4997a8dec1b2ce7d91711ee3d47d" target="_blank"&gt;against polio&lt;/a&gt; as part of a global campaign to wipe out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjhtdlddI0" target="_blank"&gt;the paralytic disease&lt;/a&gt;. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical – families need basics like food and water more &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-tetanus-vaccine-children-preventable-disease-e33a36e55d70381e4659874a2ecb371a" target="_blank"&gt;than vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Others are simply unfounded – the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gua00023b6nevuiq716@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren’t always stored correctly, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gua00033b6n8o0xllvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In many places, our work is not done with honesty,” Ayaz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00043b6nx2cbw6wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/world-health-organization" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and partners embarked on their &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-vaccine-campaign-who-gates-afghanistan-pakistan-341b1da7b7c33dbffa33fe9d9a52065e" target="_blank"&gt;polio campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/d98f518c5f074c609a4e086eb1a1e02f" target="_blank"&gt;with smallpox&lt;/a&gt; in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-launched-polio-vaccination-campaign-96bb8b0644a6e4951d48a1a55bafce32" target="_blank"&gt;in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-polio-vaccination-campaign-suspend-9fc299a2e72dddf81f913da9f7f05e81" target="_blank"&gt;and Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00053b6n41axdbb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours – has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00063b6n37vg7iii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Polio Eradication Initiative&lt;/a&gt; has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-united-nations-ap-top-news-pakistan-international-news-7d8b0e32efd0480fbd12acf27729f6a5" target="_blank"&gt;oral vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00073b6ndhdaxz4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-oral-vaccine-linked-to-rare-infection-risk-db2b278b7e4f9fea9a2df48b8508ed14" target="_blank"&gt;oral vaccine sparking outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00083b6nfuwvs9rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00093b6nk9lu35vu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPEI_generalfactsheet_25-April-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;tout the successes&lt;/a&gt; – 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared – while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-gunmen-kill-police-polio-worker-northwest-7c027ca903c282ff3f0b82973cead3aa" target="_blank"&gt;polio workers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-polio-security-officials-attacked-balochistan-1acffdfd67252701828e570d142e3b75" target="_blank"&gt;security staff&lt;/a&gt; have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000a3b6nrq8ewtg2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO’s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers’ tailored response in resistant pockets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000b3b6n4ne2aqo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,” he said. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000c3b6nb6dwu91d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000d3b6nj875d9k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-business-philanthropy-berlin-c3e0441a186a17a060d83d9c7c7a9dba" target="_blank"&gt;the Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000e3b6nlb9qoede@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Continuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000f3b6n1cqfblxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000g3b6ns8bipba6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000h3b6n00j9tzs0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, “vaccinators did not know about vaccine management,” citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000i3b6ni09ouq8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000j3b6n4wmzdo2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000k3b6n1pxq48ae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region’s poverty and transience.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000l3b6nb15lg81d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,” said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk to the press. “Many people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000m3b6n1ze41i8w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000n3b6nr41eqoad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have shared these problems with our senior officials,” the worker told AP. “They know about it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000o3b6nre1ob7j9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000p3b6nzavuahwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000q3b6n78qskce9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is so much pressure,” Ayaz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000r3b6ndsnduznr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-lifestyle-567c9fae1e50ba4f7d833dfb7f7617b6" target="_blank"&gt;most feared&lt;/a&gt;, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000s3b6n6a1rdbvp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000t3b6npmz4w1g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000u3b6n1z37ilp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eradication demands near-perfection – zero polio cases and immunizing more than 95% of children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000v3b6nmlw7kgb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But public health leaders and former WHO staffers say campaign efforts are far from perfect, and many question the oral vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000w3b6nkmct7okz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The oral vaccine – proven to be safe and effective — has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000x3b6n9e1yiv2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000y3b6nz3o30d98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000z3b6neoxohht1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn’t enough injectable vaccine — which uses no live virus and doesn’t come with the risks of the oral vaccine — to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00103b6nmn6lzxxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00113b6nnjr5jfmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he’s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00123b6ncoaojjbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no management,” he said, citing a lack of accountability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00133b6nf8wzspid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a “major course correction.” John shared the emails with AP and said he’s received no response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00143b6n2ro4yejo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “WHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,” John wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00153b6n5rq5xmcr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00163b6nwl4qyb31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00173b6nskoj9m81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00183b6nhr5npn2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, nearly all of the world’s polio cases – mostly in Africa and the Middle East – are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00193b6nisxm4mfr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-baby-polio-vaccine-who-aa79e32d45aa59f26274898c22885ba8" target="_blank"&gt;paralyzed a baby in Gaza&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001a3b6ncbkdafpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-trump-tedros-global-health-a2eafc341cd2200e8800a2421d30bdfc" target="_blank"&gt;withdrew from WHO&lt;/a&gt;, and President Donald Trump has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16" target="_blank"&gt;cut foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001c3b6nrco6tzh1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001d3b6n9xuo8zbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “If this was a private company, we would demand results.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001e3b6nwy3321l3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001f3b6n1gyijra1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Karachi, locals told AP they didn’t understand the government’s fixation on polio and complained of other issues — dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001g3b6np69poajl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" target="_blank"&gt;anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt; growing &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a" target="_blank"&gt;in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it’s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001h3b6ncxtphpp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family’s objections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001i3b6nw7xkvbty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It results in disability,” said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001j3b6noyhlasx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/measles" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/tuberculosis" target="_blank"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001k3b6nh4a9k7iy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Polio eradication has created a monster,” Closser said. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/f081f1f8fbfa401ea148cea2fcf43c28" target="_blank"&gt;CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001l3b6nw6lgw2kb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Workers see that continued mistrust every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001m3b6nmn22xqqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she’d prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it. They believe the false rumors that it will compromise their children’s fertility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001n3b6n86hgun41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I allow it,” the woman said, declining to be named over fears of family retribution, “I will be beaten and thrown out.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/pakistan" target="_blank"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-vaccine-gaza-baby-225d4997a8dec1b2ce7d91711ee3d47d" target="_blank"&gt;against polio&lt;/a&gt; as part of a global campaign to wipe out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OjhtdlddI0" target="_blank"&gt;the paralytic disease&lt;/a&gt;.

Some are practical – families need basics like food and water more &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-tetanus-vaccine-children-preventable-disease-e33a36e55d70381e4659874a2ecb371a" target="_blank"&gt;than vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Others are simply unfounded – the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gua00023b6nevuiq716@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren’t always stored correctly, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gua00033b6n8o0xllvk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In many places, our work is not done with honesty,” Ayaz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00043b6nx2cbw6wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/world-health-organization" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and partners embarked on their &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-vaccine-campaign-who-gates-afghanistan-pakistan-341b1da7b7c33dbffa33fe9d9a52065e" target="_blank"&gt;polio campaign&lt;/a&gt; in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication — a feat seen only once for human diseases, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/d98f518c5f074c609a4e086eb1a1e02f" target="_blank"&gt;with smallpox&lt;/a&gt; in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-launched-polio-vaccination-campaign-96bb8b0644a6e4951d48a1a55bafce32" target="_blank"&gt;in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-taliban-polio-vaccination-campaign-suspend-9fc299a2e72dddf81f913da9f7f05e81" target="_blank"&gt;and Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00053b6n41axdbb7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio — which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours – has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00063b6n37vg7iii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Polio Eradication Initiative&lt;/a&gt; has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-united-nations-ap-top-news-pakistan-international-news-7d8b0e32efd0480fbd12acf27729f6a5" target="_blank"&gt;oral vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00073b6ndhdaxz4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/polio-oral-vaccine-linked-to-rare-infection-risk-db2b278b7e4f9fea9a2df48b8508ed14" target="_blank"&gt;oral vaccine sparking outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI – one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00083b6nfuwvs9rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Afghanistan and Pakistan – which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure – local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00093b6nk9lu35vu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials &lt;a href="https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GPEI_generalfactsheet_25-April-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;tout the successes&lt;/a&gt; – 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared – while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-gunmen-kill-police-polio-worker-northwest-7c027ca903c282ff3f0b82973cead3aa" target="_blank"&gt;polio workers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pakistan-polio-security-officials-attacked-balochistan-1acffdfd67252701828e570d142e3b75" target="_blank"&gt;security staff&lt;/a&gt; have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000a3b6nrq8ewtg2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO’s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers’ tailored response in resistant pockets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000b3b6n4ne2aqo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,” he said. “Let’s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000c3b6nb6dwu91d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000d3b6nj875d9k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-business-philanthropy-berlin-c3e0441a186a17a060d83d9c7c7a9dba" target="_blank"&gt;the Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000e3b6nlb9qoede@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Continuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000f3b6n1cqfblxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade – given to AP by current and former staffers – show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000g3b6ns8bipba6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000h3b6n00j9tzs0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, “vaccinators did not know about vaccine management,” citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting “more used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000i3b6ni09ouq8x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, “resulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000j3b6n4wmzdo2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination teams worked “in a hurried manner,” reports said, with “no plan for monitoring or supervision.” A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000k3b6n1pxq48ae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it’s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region’s poverty and transience.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000l3b6nb15lg81d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,” said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk to the press. “Many people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000m3b6n1ze41i8w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000n3b6nr41eqoad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have shared these problems with our senior officials,” the worker told AP. “They know about it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000o3b6nre1ob7j9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an email response to AP’s questions about officials’ knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted “operational challenges” in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has “robust monitoring and evaluation processes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000p3b6nzavuahwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worker Ayaz described “fake finger marking” — placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000q3b6n78qskce9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is so much pressure,” Ayaz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000r3b6ndsnduznr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease — spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles — was among the world’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-lifestyle-567c9fae1e50ba4f7d833dfb7f7617b6" target="_blank"&gt;most feared&lt;/a&gt;, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000s3b6n6a1rdbvp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000t3b6npmz4w1g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000u3b6n1z37ilp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Eradication demands near-perfection – zero polio cases and immunizing more than 95% of children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000v3b6nmlw7kgb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But public health leaders and former WHO staffers say campaign efforts are far from perfect, and many question the oral vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000w3b6nkmct7okz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The oral vaccine – proven to be safe and effective — has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000x3b6n9e1yiv2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000y3b6nz3o30d98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub000z3b6neoxohht1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn’t enough injectable vaccine — which uses no live virus and doesn’t come with the risks of the oral vaccine — to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00103b6nmn6lzxxw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven’t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign’s problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00113b6nnjr5jfmb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he’s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00123b6ncoaojjbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s no management,” he said, citing a lack of accountability.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00133b6nf8wzspid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, former WHO scientist Dr. T. Jacob John twice emailed WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling for a “major course correction.” John shared the emails with AP and said he’s received no response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00143b6n2ro4yejo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “WHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,” John wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00153b6n5rq5xmcr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a “core pillar” of eradication strategy and that “almost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00163b6nwl4qyb31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to step back and really care for the people,” he said. “The only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00173b6nskoj9m81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00183b6nhr5npn2a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, nearly all of the world’s polio cases – mostly in Africa and the Middle East – are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub00193b6nisxm4mfr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong – particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-baby-polio-vaccine-who-aa79e32d45aa59f26274898c22885ba8" target="_blank"&gt;paralyzed a baby in Gaza&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Unless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,” he said.

            With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-trump-tedros-global-health-a2eafc341cd2200e8800a2421d30bdfc" target="_blank"&gt;withdrew from WHO&lt;/a&gt;, and President Donald Trump has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-cuts-6292f48f8d4025bed0bf5c3e9d623c16" target="_blank"&gt;cut foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001c3b6nrco6tzh1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001d3b6n9xuo8zbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn’t buy us any progress,” said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. “If this was a private company, we would demand results.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001e3b6nwy3321l3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In Karachi, locals told AP they didn’t understand the government’s fixation on polio and complained of other issues — dirty water, heroin addiction. Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" target="_blank"&gt;anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt; growing &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a" target="_blank"&gt;in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it’s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001h3b6ncxtphpp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family’s objections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001i3b6nw7xkvbty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It results in disability,” said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. “They are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001j3b6noyhlasx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/measles" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/hub/tuberculosis" target="_blank"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt;, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001k3b6nh4a9k7iy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Polio eradication has created a monster,” Closser said. It doesn’t help, she added, that in this region, public trust in vaccine campaigns was undermined when the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/f081f1f8fbfa401ea148cea2fcf43c28" target="_blank"&gt;CIA organized a fake hepatitis drive&lt;/a&gt; in 2011 in an attempt to get DNA and confirm the presence of Osama bin Laden or his family.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Workers see that continued mistrust every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001m3b6nmn22xqqi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a mountainous region of southeastern Afghanistan where most people survive by growing wheat and raising cows and chickens, a mother of five said she’d prefer that her children be vaccinated against polio, but her husband and other male relatives have instructed their families to reject it. They believe the false rumors that it will compromise their children’s fertility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdyk8gub001n3b6n86hgun41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I allow it,” the woman said, declining to be named over fears of family retribution, “I will be beaten and thrown out.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

same urgency as other epidemics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Den, radiation oncologist and chief medical officer at Alpha Tau Medical in Massachusetts, told Fox News Digital that there is a "concerning rise" in these cancers, particularly colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic and postmenopausal &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/breast-cancer" rel="nofollow

in older adults, but also in younger patients — a trend we didn’t see a generation ago," said Den, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These cancers tend to be more aggressive, harder to treat and costly to manage," he added. "The sheer number of people at risk, combined with the rising obesity rates, means we’re looking at increased cancer burdens on individuals, families and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthcare systems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthcare systems&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting healthy body weight through a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:balanced diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;, regular physical activity and less alcohol consumption are important steps toward reducing cancer risk, according to Den, as well as cancer screenings and early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As physicians, we advocate for broader &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:public health efforts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;public health efforts&lt;/a&gt; — like better nutrition education, access to healthier foods and environments that support active living," he said. "Additionally, new technologies and therapies represent a novel paradigm for the management of these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Preventing obesity is cancer prevention, and taking proactive steps now can improve long-term health outcomes across the population," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Promoting healthy body weight through a balanced diet, regular physical activity and less alcohol consumption can help reduce the risk of cancer, experts say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sue Decotiis, M.D., a medical weight-loss doctor in New York City, noted in a separate interview with Fox News Digital that the use of obesity and diabetes drugs, like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/medications" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GLP-1 medications;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GLP-1 medications&lt;/a&gt;, has been associated with reducing cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is one of the most impactful medical advancements we have had in a very long time," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the doctor, "angry, inflamed fat cells," called cytokines, are produced in large amounts in obese individuals, which can "bully and override" the body’s normal regulations, often leading to immune disruption and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Decotiis recommended seeing a certified weight-loss physician for an appropriate weight-loss plan, which could include GLP-1 medication.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to early cancer screenings, Decotiis recommends &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; as a critical way to reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shedding extra pounds can help reduce inflammation in the body by reducing cytokines, which also prevents cancers, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems more prudent to aggressively treat obesity and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as clean up our food supply, instead of waiting for cancer to develop and hoping we can catch it and successfully treat it," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Take the state of being overweight and obese seriously," Decotiis advised.

The state &lt;a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2020/01/16/cdc-jackson-ranked-nd-highest-city-stds/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.wlbt.com/2020/01/16/cdc-jackson-ranked-nd-highest-city-stds/"&gt;has long been plagued&lt;/a&gt; by high rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In years prior, Hinds County&lt;a href="https://nyrequirements.com/blog/the_50_counties_with_the_highest_std_rates_in_the_united_states" target="_self" rel="" title="https://nyrequirements.com/blog/the_50_counties_with_the_highest_std_rates_in_the_united_states"&gt; had the dishonor&lt;/a&gt; of having the highest STD rate of any county in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;However, the state’s &lt;a href="https://olemiss.edu/news/2025/05/nycu-protecting-against-syphilis/index.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://olemiss.edu/news/2025/05/nycu-protecting-against-syphilis/index.html"&gt;current boom of congenital syphilis&lt;/a&gt;, which follows a nationwide trend, has the medical community now labeling it an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/media/pdfs/2024/10/2023-STD-Surveillance-State-Ranking-Tables.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/media/pdfs/2024/10/2023-STD-Surveillance-State-Ranking-Tables.pdf"&gt;2023 report from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, Mississippi ranked 3rd in the country for reported cases of primary and secondary syphilis. In that same report, Mississippi ranked 5th for gonorrhea and 2nd for chlamydia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Syphilis, like other sexually transmitted diseases, is spread through bacteria upon contact with infected fluids; this usually happening through sex or various sex acts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The tiny corkscrew-like organism is a spirochete, or germ, of syphilis, as seen under the special "darkfield" microscope used in diagnosis of that disease, seen Sept. 28, 1937.  It's average length is 3/10,000 of an inch, or approximately the diameter of a red blood cell.  (AP Photo)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;With most STDs, the symptoms can make themselves known in a plethora of ways, including painful sores, a burning sensation, or a type of discharge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;What makes syphilis different, and in some ways harder to detect, is that, at first, its symptoms can be minor - if any at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Dr. Kayla Stover, professor and vice chair of pharmacy practice at The University of Mississippi, explained that a symptom one might have in the first stage of syphilis is a painless sore, or chancre, that would go away even without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;But though it is no longer visibly apparent, says Dr. Stover, the disease, if left untreated, could lie undetected in the body for years. And while lying undetected, the disease could slowly progress in its victim’s body, leading to more damaging stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“And each of those stages has symptoms that could be mistaken for something else,” Dr. Stover says, which is why the disease is often referred to as “The Great Imitator.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Unless you are testing for syphilis, you might not know it’s there,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In its second stage, or secondary syphilis, a rash might appear, usually on the palms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;It’s important to note here that in its early stages, syphilis is easily treatable, usually only requiring a shot of penicillin. But left untreated, the disease could continue to evolve, and one might enter the third stage: latent syphilis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In this stage, the disease could cause damage to internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The last stage, tertiary syphilis, is the disease at its most severe, causing damage to the brain or heart. Paralysis and dementia are possible during this stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;During all four stages, the carrier would still be infectious, possibly spreading it to various sexual partners. And if you are a mother, it could also spread to your child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;This is called congenital syphilis, and Mississippi has seen a 1,000% spike in the past few years, from 10 cases in 2016 to 110 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In congenital syphilis, the child is infected either in utero or as the child is being born. The complications of the now-infected child, says Dr. Stover, could either be mild or could lead to the child’s death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Also of note: a rising population contracting syphilis is the age range from 14 to 24 years old. In those populations, a threat from the disease is infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Those are some of the challenges [from obtaining syphilis],” says Dr. Stover. “As simple as you’re putting other people at risk, to you could be damaging, long-term, your life, your children, your expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Deja Abdul-Haqq, the director of My Brother’s Keeper, a local nonprofit focusing on public health, says they began seeing a spike in syphilis cases after the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;As for the reason for the spike, she said, “To break it down really simple: condomless sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="media-item | figure media-item-image article-image w-100"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figure-caption mt-1 px-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;This April 1, 2016 file photos shows a billboard above a gas station that reads "Feel The Burn," a play on then-presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' campaign slogan, "Feel The Bern." It's actually promoting testing for sexually transmitted diseases. The number of cases of STDs - chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis - in California reached a record high in 2017,and officials are particularly concerned by a spike in stillbirths due to congenital syphilis, state health authorities said Monday, May 14, 2018. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit"&gt;(Nick Ut | AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Abdul-Haqq would say there is a lack of information regarding condom use in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. While this would seemingly be a basic concept to most, in Mississippi, it’s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;In Mississippi schools, sex-education classes cannot include instruction and demonstrations on how to use a condom. In 2015, a teacher in Starkville &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/3abd7740ee5b4d419fbdfbcd8a094d57" target="_self" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/3abd7740ee5b4d419fbdfbcd8a094d57"&gt;was suspended&lt;/a&gt; after a student in her class put a prophylactic on a cucumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;That same year, a teacher went viral &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alivelez/meet-the-brilliant-mississippi-teacher-who-used-a-sock-to-te" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alivelez/meet-the-brilliant-mississippi-teacher-who-used-a-sock-to-te"&gt;for side-stepping the condom rule&lt;/a&gt; by demonstrating how to put a sock on a foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Likewise, there is the lack, in Abdul-Haqq’s eyes, of information pertaining to modern prevention tools like PrEP, a medication which can prevent HIV infection, and Doxy-PEP, another medication that can prevent STDs such as syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Imagine if all of these mothers that were exposed to syphilis during sex would have gotten Doxy-PEP within 72 hours,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Dr. Stover would echo some of Abdul-Haqq’s same points, saying that Mississippi’s sex education has not been as progressive as other states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;And in the era of medications such as PrEP and Doxy-PEP, Dr. Stover says that people may not be as scared of unprotected sex as they used to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;According to recent data, Black men in Mississippi have higher rates of syphilis than others. A &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/page//resources/6015.pdf" target="_self" rel="" title="https://msdh.ms.gov/page//resources/6015.pdf"&gt;2019 MSDH report&lt;/a&gt; found that of the 690 cases of primary and secondary syphilis that year, 338 were in Black men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The second-highest rate was found in Black women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“The information regarding the solution to these issues usually gets to the Black communities late,” Abdul-Haqq said. “So, it’s not so much the individual, it’s the environment that does not promote access to all of these prevention methods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Throughout the years, &lt;a href="https://www.sunherald.com/news/health/article125868159.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.sunherald.com/news/health/article125868159.html"&gt;billboard campaigns&lt;/a&gt; arose in the state and across the country in an effort to raise awareness about STDs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The billboards, initiated by the AIDs Healthcare Foundation, have phrases on them such as “STDs are Timeless” and “Testing is Caring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The same foundation &lt;a href="https://www.aidshealth.org/2025/03/ahfs-bold-billboard-campaign-stresses-syphilis-is-curable/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.aidshealth.org/2025/03/ahfs-bold-billboard-campaign-stresses-syphilis-is-curable/"&gt;also has a billboard campaign&lt;/a&gt; focusing on syphilis; those billboards reading things like “Syphilis is Curable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;While well-intentioned, Abdul-Haqq says these billboard campaigns may not be doing enough for those who may need the information the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Culturally and aesthetically, it doesn’t engage the Black community, and the message is too vague,” she said. “We have to hit people with data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want more WLBT news in your inbox? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wlbt.com/newsletter/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to subscribe to our newsletter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;See a spelling or grammar error in our story?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo13yd000o3b79ofc39vup@published"&gt;My husband had diabetes and obesity-induced erectile dysfunction for a decade, which, after significant weight loss, has improved. His dick does get hard now! But the moment it senses pussy, it can’t stay that way. Having penetrative sex is important to me, and I married him anyway because I know this is a fixable issue. Science cares about boners!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo140m000p3b79ftgfur13@published"&gt;He’s tried all the different drugs, and they help, but we still can’t get there. I even had to do IVF because we couldn’t even attempt to get pregnant the traditional way. At this point, I’ve given up and feel resentful about the IVF, frustrated that it took him so long to deal with it in the first place, hurt that he won’t keep looking for solutions, and sad that I’ve signed up to never get fucked again. He insists that non-monogamy is off the table for us. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="1" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo142n000q3b79au0ggxp9@published"&gt;—Never&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo146i000s3b79x7q4vuxd@published"&gt;It’s possible that erectile dysfunction medication simply isn’t enough. Often, soft or absent erections are at least partially caused by a person’s mental state, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/04/marriage-advice-wife-cheating-accusation.html"&gt;as licensed marriage and family therapist Moushumi Ghose shared with us in a recent column&lt;/a&gt;. So while your husband’s issue is probably fixable with the right support, it absolutely requires his own desire to find a solution, which very much seems to be absent.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo148g000t3b79k0tckji8@published"&gt;Unfortunately, you married him thinking that as long as he found the right pill, this would be resolved. Sadly, this isn’t always the case—and that is indeed disappointing. Take some time to process your feelings around this. You might need several weeks. Talking with a trusted and sympathetic friend would be helpful. Once you’ve worked through any frustration with yourself, anger at a lack of education around these subjects, and new layers of emotions toward your husband, start considering your remaining options.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo14c7000v3b79dg2getw7@published"&gt;Think through whether this issue is a dealbreaker for you, either because penetration is important to you or because you want a husband who is able and willing to put in the effort to engage in finding a solution. Think long and hard, with as clear a mind as you can, because saying any version of “I feel these awful emotions, and need you to do something in order to be willing to stay in the relationship” is nearly impossible to come back from when the answer is anything other than agreeable. Also consider whether you’re likely to be satisfied even if he does follow through on dildos or pumps and they work—will that be enough, at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdyo14e7000w3b79gpsbgmzz@published"&gt;When you’ve mulled over your options and can approach your husband calmly, start the conversation. Let your husband know that you’re miserable. Leave space for him to process and respond, and be prepared to take a few-hour or days-long breaks, as this discussion might need to happen in chunks, for both of your sakes. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I have three young children and a satisfying sex life. We have a closed relationship and, although I fantasize about other women and watch porn, I don’t want to hook up with anyone else. Also, I love dancing. I like to dance at home alone or with my kids, with my wife at a party, and (very occasionally) out with friends at a bar or club. I’m conventionally handsome and a better dancer than people expect, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/10/married-dancing-with-other-women-at-clubs-advice.html"&gt;and I sometimes end up dancing with strangers when I’m out, especially when it starts getting late.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if staying young wasn’t just about how much you move, but how you actually move your body? A new study reveals that our muscles can produce a powerful anti-aging molecule. The molecule, called CLCF1, is released mainly during resistance training and seems to help preserve muscle strength, bone density, and overall resilience as we age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings could reshape how we think about exercise, aging, and even future drug therapies designed to mimic the benefits of physical activity. For years, scientists have known that exercise helps us stay healthier longer, but they could never figure out why the same &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/this-is-how-exercise-supercharges-the-immune-system-against-cancer/"&gt;workout that works wonders&lt;/a&gt; for young adults seems less effective in older people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new study offers a clue, and it all comes down to how our muscles talk to the rest of the body using tiny signaling molecules called myokines. CLCF1 is one of them. It turns out, while young muscles release plenty of CLCF1 during aerobic or strength workouts, &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/aging-might-travel-through-your-blood-and-this-protein-is-behind-it/"&gt;older muscles&lt;/a&gt; don’t, unless they’re properly stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This research provides a biological basis for why exercise becomes less effective with age, and it lays the groundwork for developing new therapeutic strategies for healthy aging,” Yong Ryoul Yang, one of the study authors and an expert on aging at the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience &amp;amp; BioTechnology, &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-athletes-way/202506/strength-training-triggers-a-youth-boosting-protein"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-role-of-clcf1-in-healthy-aging"&gt;Role of CLCF1 in healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1 (CLCF1) is produced by skeletal muscle during exercise and plays a role in supporting muscle and bone health. During their study, the researchers noticed that in young adults, both &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/back-in-the-gym-after-a-long-break-dont-worry-about-losing-your-gains-you-have-muscle-memory/"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) caused a rise in circulating CLCF1 immediately after exercise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They further discovered that people who were more physically active also had higher resting levels of the molecule. However, in older adults, the pattern was very different. Simply walking on a treadmill for an hour, a typical form of cardio, didn’t lead to any real increase in CLCF1 levels, not even after weeks of regular workouts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, what worked for them was a 12-week strength training program done three times a week. Older participants who followed this routine showed a significant boost in CLCF1 levels. Their muscles and bones began showing signs of rejuvenation, similar to younger individuals. The researchers believe this delayed but clear response highlights how essential resistance training becomes &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/biology/aging-isnt-linear/"&gt;as we age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrate that both resistance training for 16 weeks and resistance band exercise for 12 weeks significantly elevated plasma CLCF1 levels in older adults,” the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, to understand why older muscles weren’t responding well to cardio, the team dug deeper. They studied mice and found the same trend. Older mice didn’t produce much CLCF1 after aerobic exercise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when scientists gave the mice recombinant CLCF1, a lab-made version of the molecule, their muscle strength and bone density improved, even without exercise. The problem didn’t seem to be the gene for CLCF1 itself (which was still present), but a partner protein called CRLF1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis demonstrated that CLCF1 expression remained stable with age, whereas cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1), a protein crucial for CLCF1 secretion, exhibited a significant decline in expression,” the study authors note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This protein helps transport and release CLCF1, and its levels drop as we age. Without enough CRLF1, older muscle cells can’t release CLCF1 efficiently during cardio workouts. Further experiments showed that when CLCF1 was blocked, the health benefits disappeared, proving that this molecule plays a direct &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/magic-mushrooms-slow-aging/"&gt;role in protecting aging&lt;/a&gt; muscles and bones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-resistance-training-is-a-must-for-healthy-aging"&gt;Resistance training is a must for healthy aging&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study offers strong biological proof that resistance training isn’t just about building muscle; it may actually rewind the clock on some aspects of aging. For healthy aging, it is crucial, and possibly even more important than cardio, as we grow older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that even simple &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/working-out-gut-microbes-vs-cancer/"&gt;bodyweight exercises&lt;/a&gt; or resistance bands, done consistently, can trigger the release of beneficial molecules like CLCF1. Plus, the earlier you start, the more muscle and bone savings you’ll have for the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, the discovery of CLCF1’s role in musculoskeletal health opens up exciting new possibilities. For instance, CLCF1 could also become part of a treatment for age-related conditions like sarcopenia (muscle loss) or &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/bone-atom-by-atom-04233/"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully, further research will reveal new ways in which scientists could harness the potential of CLCF1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings collectively suggest that CLCF1 may contribute to the regulation of age-associated musculoskeletal deterioration, and warrant further investigation into its potential role as a modulator of musculoskeletal health during aging,” the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59959-w"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Only one case of Powassan virus has been recorded on Martha’s Vineyard in the past 20 years, officials said. So far this year, three cases have been confirmed in Massachusetts. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Powassan virus is spread to people by the bite of an infected tick and can be transmitted within just 15 minutes. Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, and vomiting. Severe cases can cause brain swelling, seizures, and long-term neurological complications. There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat the virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Most cases occur in the Northeast and Great Lakes region from late spring through mid-fall, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Powassan virus is carried by nymph and adult deer ticks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare,” Dr. Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor who has conducted research on Martha’s Vineyard, said in a statement. Collaborating with the island’s tick program, his lab tested more than 3,500 nymph deer ticks between 2021 and 2024. Between 1 and 2 percent of deer ticks were&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;infected, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England,” he said. “This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Officials did not disclose the age of the resident, or when they might have been infected with the virus.
