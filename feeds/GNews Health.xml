They look kind of dazed. They’re miserable. There’s a glassy look to their eyes,” he said. In addition this year, he said, there’s a fair number of kids who have milder symptoms but “annoying enough that they’re still coming in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd3020" class="body-graf"&gt;Influenza A, specifically H3N2, is the dominant strain right now. While anyone of any age can be affected, H3N2 tends to cause more hospitalizations and deaths in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6c3fd" class="body-graf"&gt;There is concern that kids who are sick now with flu will spread it to grandparents and other older adults over the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03c5c" class="body-graf"&gt;“With schools going on break for a couple of weeks and family gatherings happening, it’s quite possible that some of the existing mixing of viruses amongst the school groups are going to change to a different population,” Budd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a77fdf" class="body-heading"&gt;Where is flu spreading? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-96f626"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1238" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg" alt="U.S. map showing flu spread, ending Dec. 13."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;U.S. map showing flu spread, ending Dec. 13.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-512050" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu activity is high or very high in 14 states — including Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey and South Carolina — as well as New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ecda59" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu doesn’t need to be widespread, however, to be deadly. While the CDC’s latest report shows “minimal” flu activity in Wisconsin, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/121825.htm" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials reported&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that a child in the state died of flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c3493" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/17/ncdhhs-announces-first-pediatric-flu-death-2025-26-season-urges-vaccination-children-6-months-and" target="_blank"&gt;North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; reported its first pediatric flu death of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bac42a" class="body-graf"&gt;Those cases are likely not counted among the CDC’s latest report, which shows three pediatric flu deaths so far this year, as the data is current through Dec. 13. The CDC’s next flu update will release on Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c71f8" class="body-graf"&gt;The 2024-2025 flu season was particularly deadly, especially for children. According to the latest data, 288 children died of flu — tying a record set during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b0029" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC report published in September&lt;/a&gt; found that half of the children who died of flu last year were otherwise healthy. About 89% hadn’t received the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6d434f" class="body-heading"&gt;Will the flu shot work this year?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e1aecc" class="body-graf"&gt;The annual flu shot is notoriously imperfect when it comes to matching the exact strains of flu that circulate. This year, a strain called H3N2 subclade K emerged, making changes on the surface protein of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896c6d" class="body-graf"&gt;The surface protein is important because that’s what the body looks for to recognize whether it’s seen the virus before. If the protein looks even slightly different, the body may not be able to fight it off as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-571039" class="body-graf"&gt;Budd said it’s hard to predict how well this vaccine will ultimately work. Even though the strain has “drifted” a bit, the vaccines do contain protection against H3N2 virus in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9904a1" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’ve had past seasons where there have been what we call drifted viruses, which is how we would categorize this subclade K,” she said. “In some of those instances, there have been impacts on vaccine effectiveness, but there have also been seasons with drifted strains where we’ve seen the vaccine continue to provide protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9de3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Budd said it’s important for everyone, including children, to get the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7605af" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is still the primary preventive measure against flu, severe illness, and we absolutely continue to recommend it this year, even in light of the drifted strain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-527bf3" class="body-graf"&gt;Demand for Tamiflu, an antiviral used to help treat the flu, is slightly higher than it was this time last year, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/research/flu-season-tracking-tamiflu-fills" target="_blank"&gt;according to GoodRx.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31e609" class="body-graf"&gt;People generally only get prescription antivirals when they’re sick enough to go to the doctor, not just because they tested positive for the flu, said Tori Marsh, senior director of research for GoodRx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e97017" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“What stands out this season is how early Tamiflu use is climbing,” she said. “When we see prescription antiviral use rise sooner than average, it often points to flu activity building earlier and potentially lasting longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:42:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxORnhRcmJjVjJpVVlaM0N1S1hYeUxCazA0OFlfNnhQUVUzeXZlMTZmYjFPMl9wc0ZhMjRkdFNmbWFCWl9KVW9JbENONUlnRE5GYXhhRTMyZ05Ib28wSjlndG9xZ2VxUElWSVItMjV2Z3VHYlNIdjU2UHhvOUZjZHp1WWNWbEE3em1aVHlqSlVoSC1vRFhmVXhGR0tDTkdObXJORGZGQnhadU5lRm5O0gFWQVVfeXFMT3FFR0pETzRtRWdmV3N4cjVOLTJpU2UtTGNJNmVxWEhaWFh1U29BbnpwME1FQWVQS3dIckFiUXJfWlZoTi1od2h3UkphbVpxMzVEekIxQ0E</guid></item><item><title>美国授予研究非洲婴儿乙型肝炎疫苗的丹麦科学家无竞标合同-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/hepatitis-b-vaccine-contract-guineabissau-1fbca4928e01f364e20ae5ae57b2330e</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration has awarded a $1.6 million, no-bid contract to a Danish university to study hepatitis B vaccinations on newborns in Africa that is raising ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unusual contract was awarded to scientists who have been cited by anti-vaccine activists and whose work has been questioned by leading public health experts. Some experts have suggested the research plan is unethical, because it will withhold vaccines that work from newborns at significant risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract did not undergo a customary ethics review, The Associated Press has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded the grant to a research team at the University of Southern Denmark that has been lauded by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., according to a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-12-18/pdf/2025-23245.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;federal notice posted this week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the team’s leaders is Christine Stabell Benn, a consultant for a Kennedy-appointed committee that recently voted to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752"&gt;stop recommending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a dose of hepatitis B vaccine for all U.S. newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The study is to begin early next year in Guinea-Bissau, an impoverished West African nation where hepatitis B infection &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746078/#:~:text=Results:%20A%20total%20of%202715,enqu%C3%AAtes%20dans%20la%20population%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The researchers are funded for five years to study 14,000 newborns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s to be a randomized controlled trial, with some infants given the hepatitis B vaccine at birth and some not. Children will be tracked for death, illness and long-term developmental outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Most of the children will be followed for less than two years to look for side effects, but the first 500 enrolled will be followed for five years to look for behavior and brain development problems. There is no placebo involved, according to a copy of the study protocol prepared earlier this year that was obtained by the AP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can be passed from an infected mother to a baby. It also can be spread by other infected people a baby comes in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Research and widespread medical consensus holds that the hepatitis B vaccine protects newborns, so withholding it from some babies — in this case, Black babies — has raised ethical alarms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical evidence is clear that the vaccine protects infants from developing liver disease and an early death. The well-documented infection risk far outweighs hypothetical concerns about side effects, said Dr. Boghuma K. Titanji, an Emory University infectious diseases doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called the study “unconscionable,” and said it likely will exacerbate existing vaccine hesitancy in Africa and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much potential for this to be a harmful study,” said Titanji, who is from Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benn did not respond to an email seeking comment about the proposal. An automatic response said she is out of the office until early January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the research team said the study “will be the first and likely the only one of its kind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said it takes advantage of an unusual window of opportunity: Guinea-Bissau doesn’t currently recommended a birth dose of the hep B vaccine, but the nation will be implementing universal vaccination of newborns in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine skeptics and opponents have suggested that all the vaccine’s possible side effects were inadequately studied before the CDC began recommending it for newborns in 1991. Public health experts counter that over more than three decades no serious side effect has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award is highly unusual. The CDC did not announce a research funding opportunity and invite proposals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal was unsolicited and the award did not go through customary review, said a CDC official with knowledge of the decision. Department of Health and Human Services officials told CDC officials to approve it and said HHS would provide special funding for it, the CDC official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In private communications channels, CDC staffers were expressing outrage about the award, said the official, who is not authorized to talk about it and spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those CDC scientists have compared the work to the infamous &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/30ba57133d6b47618eff042285b54d0e"&gt;Tuskegee Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which the agency oversaw in its later stages. In that decades-long study, health workers withheld treatment from unsuspecting Black men infected with syphilis so doctors could track the horrible ravages of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Like Tuskegee, this study involves the prospect of researchers watching people grow ill when a medical intervention could have kept them healthy, Titanji echoed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is an apt comparison,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study’s researchers say the trial was approved by a national ethics committee in Guinea-Bissau. But it did not undergo a customary ethics review within the CDC, the agency official told the AP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said “we will ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards are met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health scientists noted questions have been raised in the past about research led by Benn and her husband, Peter Aaby, in their &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bandim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bandim Health Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Danish researchers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who reviewed Aaby and Benn’s work have described questionable research practices. Earlier this year, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/02/rfk-jr-vaccines-former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-says-kennedy-mangled-science-in-gavi-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; calling a 2017 study co-authored by Aaby and Benn “fundamentally flawed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several researchers had harsh words about the latest award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aaby and Benn are doing the Guinea-Bissau HBV vaccine depravation trial,” Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist, wrote in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlbergstrom.com/post/3mac5tfh4722v" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Bluesky. “Did RFK Jr. just call up the first name in the antivax yellow pages?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bsky.app/profile/angierasmussen.bsky.social/post/3mablyin5is2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was giving taxpayers’ money to his “cronies” for a “grossly unethical study that will expose African babies to hep B for no reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

As New Yorkers travel to and from the city, attend parties, and visit family and friends, health officials are urging people to take precautions against a strain that seems to be tearing through the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9oo5n"&gt;Here’s what to know about the virus, vaccination rates and how to stay healthy this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="a5sh7"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s new about this year’s flu?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="attl5"&gt;The dominant flu virus that’s currently infecting people across the country is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/17/well/new-flu-variant-symptoms.html#:~:text=The%20main%20version%20of%20flu,subclade%20K%20%E2%80%94%20is%20what&amp;amp;#x27;s%20new." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;relative of the common H3N2&lt;/a&gt; strain. But experts say this variant, called subclade K, has a number of mutations that don’t respond as well to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="evqqr"&gt;“Symptom-wise, [there’s] nothing that we know that's different about this virus outside of the fact that it's just going to be able to infect more people and therefore we'll see more cases,” said Andy Pekosz, a virologist and professor of microbiology at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="95n2o"&gt;Still, Pekosz encouraged people to get vaccinated to prevent the most severe symptoms of the disease, and to guard against some of the other strains in circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3ao9j"&gt;As of mid-November, 3.4 million New Yorkers statewide had received their flu shots — about 5% fewer than had been vaccinated by that time last year, according to the state Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="6q94h"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Schools, kids on the front line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8u9br"&gt;The virus is also coursing its way through city schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9jsre"&gt;In New York City, nearly 500,000 children have received flu shots so far this season, representing a 6.5% drop compared to the same period last year, according to the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="29a9m"&gt;Parents have been telling Gothamist anecdotally that classrooms have been half-empty this week but the city Department of Education couldn’t immediately say if there’s been a significant, systemwide drop in attendance. Attendance at New York City schools was at 85% Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3dg7h"&gt;Poly Prep Country Day School closed its Dyker Heights campus on Dec. 10 and 11 out of “an abundance of caution” after about a third of the student body was absent or sent home with flu-like symptoms, according to Jennifer Slomack, the school’s senior director of engagement and communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8p7rq"&gt;“The two-day closure allowed students time to rest and recover while we simultaneously did an intensive disinfection of hard surfaces and UV sanitizing through our forced-air HVAC systems,” she said.

In &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, 224 people are in quarantine amid an outbreak that has sickened 144 people. Most are unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children’s Health Defense, or CHD, which Kennedy led from&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-rfk-jr-built-anti-vaccine-juggernaut-amid-covid-4997be1bcf591fe8b7f1f90d16c9321e#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Kennedy,as%20an%20afterthought." data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 2015&lt;/a&gt; to 2024, produces a daily stream of articles and videos stoking fear about vaccines and falsely suggesting that the risks associated with vaccine-preventable diseases are exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the height of the South Carolina outbreak this month, when more than 200 people were in quarantine, CHD published an article circulating anti-vaccine tropes and arguing that criticism of Kennedy over the spread of measles was unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The article says CHD’s chief scientific officer “questioned whether measles needs to be prevented in the first place”. It quoted the host of a CHD.TV show saying it was “absurd” to blame Kennedy for outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CHD did not respond to a Guardian request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As measles spread through the US this year, Kennedy has made statements that undermined confidence in the measles vaccine and the public health response, experts said. In one interview with CBS, he said “people should get the measles vaccine”, but then raised concerns &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/o2U0csKvqMY?t=553" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about whether it was adequately safety-tested&lt;/a&gt;. In an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HVk-14n-VRE?t=2020" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;appearance in Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, he said the vaccine waned in effectiveness and was “leaky”, and suggested the case counts in the US were not so bad, compared with larger numbers overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR,97%25%20effective%20against%20measles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt; two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, is 97% effective. Most people do not experience side-effects and those that do occur are usually mild, like a fever or soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“HHS and CDC continue to support strong measles containment through active monitoring and coordination with state and local health departments,” Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for Kennedy, said in an email, adding that the US was faring better than Mexico and Canada in its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has emphasized that vaccination remains the most effective protection against measles,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Public health experts said the article published by CHD this month was just the latest example of how the group was working off a familiar anti-vaccine playbook to defend Kennedy, downplay the dangers of disease and exaggerate the risks of vaccines – making it seem that it was worse to get vaccinated than to get sick, when the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These kinds of posts served multiple purposes, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine law expert at UC Law San Francisco, who has tracked CHD and Kennedy for years. They were trying to convince themselves and people on the ground that measles was not so bad, while also defending Kennedy and themselves, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nobody wants to believe that they’re hurting children,” Reiss said. “They will be blamed for this, and they will be rightly blamed for this, because most of the cases are in the unvaccinated and they have been promoting anti-vaccine misinformation for years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Public health experts said Kennedy’s leadership had hurt efforts to contain measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even if he’s not responsible for the actual start of the outbreak, he is most certainly responsible for the spread of the outbreak,” said Amy Pisani, CEO of the advocacy group Vaccinate Your Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not the first time CHD has mobilized this year around an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a measles outbreak in Texas earlier this year, CHD encouraged people not to get vaccinated and traveled there to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-ben-edwards-2dd7c79d47c64ad2e6d4a4ac3c87ec1f" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;produce videos&lt;/a&gt; saying measles wasn’t so dangerous. “Measles is not a grave threat to America’s children,” Mary Holland, chief executive officer, said in one article. It also published videos, articles and social media posts suggesting that the people who died of measles died of something else. Kennedy later echoed CHD’s assertions, suggesting that one child’s death &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263#:~:text=He%20said%20the,two%20weeks%20before.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;may have been caused by some other reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She got over the measles, according to her parents, and according to the medical reports, I saw a report on it today, the thing that killed her was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection,” he told CBS News. He told Fox News her death was caused by pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pneumonia is one of many possible &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31490?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawOw7CVleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFIbnYyYmtEZGp3bXgzTGNXc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHkxc2DG-fVqPatJsatp4v9fzapThbI32mxsh5PoW4PeLNsqAJVvKvVaSEs6d_aem_CRs2YmnIynERUz7ACplVbw#:~:text=Other%20measles%20symptoms%20may%20include%20small%20spots%20in%20the%20cheek%20area%20inside%20the%20mouth%2C%20diarrhea%20and%20ear%20infection.%20Measles%20can%20lead%20to%20pneumonia%2C%20swelling%20of%20the%20brain%2C%20deafness%2C%20intellectual%20disability%20and%20death." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;complications of measles&lt;/a&gt;, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Those false assertions become a distraction from the reality that vaccines can help keep children alive and protected from disease, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The group’s work is notable at a time when a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/cdc-social-media-silence-during-2025-measles-outbreak-left-void-filled-news-media-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found what researchers called an emerging online “health communication void” around measles. They said the CDC had posted just 10 times about measles across three social media platforms between January and August, far less than the average of 45.8 posts during that time frame in the past four years. From 2021 to 2024, 82% of posts promoted routine or “catch-up” measles vaccination, but not a single post from 2025 emphasized routine vaccination, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By contrast, they found CHD posted 101 times about measles on X alone during the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In South Carolina, 18 more people have been reported infected since 12 December. State health officials said this week that children from four schools remained in quarantine, and some would be quarantined until 2 January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMXliTjl5X3dCejQ5UVNzTnhXXzVJa3FfSURhUTFzOTE5VVJZdlBTdWkzQ3pCOEVVRURsazdlcXhLSEhEb2JoNUcycU00d2xVTElyRTFINVE5SUR3QWV2WEdLMXdtYVZncnFoY21vS0hxNjI1cS1CcDhDdWRXQUlZSGJGYUtWcGppS0R2LW4wNEhnREpG</guid></item><item><title>跑步如何欺骗你的大脑高估时间- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/how-running-tricks-your-brain-into-overestimating-time/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-07814-9" target="_blank"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has revealed that running alters how we perceive time. Researchers note that the effect is driven by the mental demands of controlling movement, rather than physical exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human perception of time rarely aligns perfectly with clock time. Everyday experiences, such as waiting in line or enduring a monotonous task, can feel longer than they truly are. Research has shown that physical activity, including cycling, walking, and running, can influence these distortions of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the underlying mechanism has remained uncertain. Some scientists have argued that physiological changes, such as elevated heart rate or hormone release, are responsible. Others have proposed that cognitive factors, particularly the attentional resources required to manage complex movements, play a more significant role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Tommaso Bartolini from the Italian Institute of Technology, the research team sought to clarify whether distortions in time perception during running are primarily physiological or cognitive in origin. Running on a treadmill requires careful motor control, which may place additional demands on attention. By comparing running with other conditions that involve less physical effort but still require cognitive resources, the researchers aimed to isolate the source of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 22 participants (10 females), with an average age of 26. Each participant was asked to memorize a two‑second visual stimulus (a blue square displayed on a screen) and then judge whether subsequent stimuli lasted the same amount of time. This task was performed under four conditions: standing still (baseline), running on a treadmill at 80 percent of maximum heart rate, walking backwards on the treadmill, or standing still while performing a concurrent visual memory task (dual task).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate was monitored throughout the running and backward walking sessions to measure physical exertion**, while it was recorded for one minute prior to the baseline and dual task sessions.** The researchers then analyzed the accuracy and precision of participants’ time judgments across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a consistent pattern. In all three experimental conditions (running, walking backwards, and the dual task) participants overestimated the duration of stimuli compared to the baseline. For example, during running, a stimulus lasting approximately 1.8 seconds was perceived as equal to the two‑second reference, representing an overestimation of nearly nine percent. Walking backwards and the dual task produced similar distortions of about seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these distortions did not correlate with changes in heart rate. Although running elevated heart rate substantially more than walking backwards, the magnitude of the time distortion was nearly identical. This strongly suggests that the effect is not driven by physiological exertion but by the cognitive effort required to control movement or divide attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, participants’ precision—i.e., the consistency of their judgments—remained stable across conditions. This indicates that while their perception of duration was biased, their ability to reproduce that bias reliably was unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartolini and colleagues concluded, “the results of the current study suggest that we should be very cautious in interpreting perceptual timing biases observed during physical activities as reflecting physiological alterations. The results also encourage the scientific community investigating time perception in ecological sensorimotor contexts to consider the potential confounding role of cognitive factors implicated in the execution of complex motor routines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some limitations are to be noted. For instance, the study focused exclusively on running and visual stimuli, leaving open questions about whether similar effects occur with other activities or sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-07814-9" target="_blank"&gt;The role of physical and cognitive effort on time perception&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tommaso Bartolini, Irene Petrizzo, Roberto Arrighi, and Giovanni Anobile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:16:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOVkdfZC1qRXY3UlBhRmplY1ZnakV3Mm5qM19SNlNaWkFNUTNMZzBEa3dlWXlLRWRVamdfYmRHWVEyOTdWSm41ajNIaHlScWdHbWQxdWlCQWx1ZzBHNjczV2pySTc1WXAwU0twV2FOR2VvQTJxM0Q4cVg3WGtPMV9uTW54MjVwUQ</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府实际上可能会对慢性病做一些好事--除非是小RFK。挡道-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/chronic-lyme-disease-rfk-jr-could-help-patients-or-could-be-a-disaster.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2bw2e007y2gkp0bvj1gfv@published"&gt;When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001u3b7blifp16jj@published"&gt;But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-cabinet-confirmation-hearings/card/rfk-jr-i-did-probably-say-that-lyme-disease-was-a-bioweapon-uQVxXUN67wwWnw2nw93Y"&gt;once claimed&lt;/a&gt; Lyme disease was &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/may/16/tucker-carlson/was-lyme-disease-spread-as-a-bioweapon-no-that-the/"&gt;developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon&lt;/a&gt; in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001v3b7b4ig8marn@published"&gt;This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001w3b7bmbl9hznn@published"&gt;Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the &lt;em&gt;aftermath&lt;/em&gt; of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001x3b7bhl1gth1y@published"&gt;Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001y3b7byhiehniw@published"&gt;The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme &lt;em&gt;infection&lt;/em&gt;, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001z3b7bhqyxm23z@published"&gt;But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00203b7bzow664o1@published"&gt;But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00213b7bj8gtgrfi@published"&gt;“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00223b7b5wwtcrh4@published"&gt;It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/03/rfk-new-vaccine-policy-changes-maha"&gt;accordingly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00233b7bawmxfkhe@published"&gt;There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00243b7bgie6us9u@published"&gt;“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/durland-fish/"&gt;Dr. Durland Fish&lt;/a&gt;, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00253b7bgblr45w5@published"&gt;These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00263b7bs86fldy0@published"&gt;And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00273b7bk8m8hdat@published"&gt;“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00283b7b86mkgwoj@published"&gt;Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/defense-bill-directs-gao-to-probe-tick-conspiracy-promoted-by-rfk-jr/"&gt;slipped a provision&lt;/a&gt; in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/07/17/gop-lawmaker-thinks-rise-lyme-disease-is-due-secret-tick-experiment-scientist-squashes-that-idea/"&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk00293b7b9v82a4le@published"&gt;And few are as damaging to chronic Lyme’s reputation among skeptics as Kennedy himself. As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/09/vaccine-covid-coronavirus-safety-fda/"&gt;deaths to the COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, connected both Tylenol and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/10/circumcision-tylenol-autism-rfk/"&gt;circumcision to autism&lt;/a&gt;, and linked &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/29/ssris-mass-shootings-science-rfk/"&gt;SSRIs to mass shootings&lt;/a&gt;. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002a3b7ba0ciyk17@published"&gt;The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002b3b7b30zuvel9@published"&gt;Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002c3b7bzej9xqvp@published"&gt;“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002d3b7bjg1tv8ct@published"&gt;Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002e3b7boma1oia8@published"&gt;Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002f3b7beqrac170@published"&gt;For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002g3b7b80rl10w0@published"&gt;Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002h3b7b89dqz06s@published"&gt;But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is part of sweeping changes to childhood immunizations by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, which have global repercussions – including cutting funding for programs that bring vaccines to countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He has a fixed, immutable belief that vaccines cause harm,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “He will do everything he can to try and prove that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The actions taken this year by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, have “a global impact”, said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of the grassroots group Defend Public Health. “It is spreading like an infection all its own throughout the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ac53fa77-3147-4904-b1aa-a83868a3b251" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"CDC ends recommendation for all US newborns to receive hepatitis B vaccine","elementId":"ac53fa77-3147-4904-b1aa-a83868a3b251","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/hepatitis-b-vaccine-cdc"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Testing established vaccines in a country with high rates of hepatitis B and a fragile health system “reeks of a neocolonialist attitude” and risks expanding global mistrust of the US and science, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global Health Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Kennedy announced in June that the US would end funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has vaccinated more than 1.2 billion children and saved an estimated 20.6 million lives, he sent shock waves through global health – and he cited an unusual study from 2018 to justify the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00079/full" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; made an alarming claim: the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine caused death in young girls in Guinea-Bissau. It was published by a group of Danish researchers, including a married couple named Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But when Kennedy made his announcement in 2025, he did not mention a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X21007209" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from some of the same authors on the same topic finding completely different results, essentially nullifying the first study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We did not find that early-DTP was associated with increased female mortality as found in a previous study,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is one example of their questionable research, which has drawn criticism from other researchers and journalists examining their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now those same researchers will be the ones carrying out the new study on hepatitis B vaccination in Guinea-Bissau. US funding will go to the &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Bandim Health Project&lt;/a&gt;, led by Aaby and Stabell Benn, at the University of Southern Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aaby and Stabell Benn did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about the details of the five-year study, set to begin in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Babies in the randomized, controlled trial will or will not receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Researchers will then compare early-life mortality, illness and development between the groups, according to the &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;award announcement&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; giving the vaccine to all babies at birth, but Guinea-Bissau has struggled to roll out the shots to every newborn, instead &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.14045#:~:text=Examples%20of%20risk%2Dfactors%20of,Bissau%20between%202005%20and%202007." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; the dose at six weeks of age. The country has pledged to fill that gap and plans on recommending hepatitis B vaccines to all newborns in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is a major breach of scientific ethics to withhold an intervention that has been proven safe and effective. “It’s highly unethical to choose to give a vaccine to some children but not others,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yamey noted: “There’s already an RCT [randomized, controlled trial] showing superior outcomes with the birth dose, so why is another one needed?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study does not appear to be looking at whether the vaccine is more effective at birth, which Jacobs said was “concerning” as “nowhere in this do they say that they’re going to study the efficacy of the vaccine itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the trial will examine whether there are “overall health effects” – not specific outcomes, such as preventing infection from the virus – when the shot is given at birth, &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Bandim Health Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This announcement has set alarm bells ringing in the global health community,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, calling it a symptom of “a policy desperately searching for evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is not clear what the research question is. It seems to be about the safety of the vaccine rather than its effectiveness, but both are already well-established, and to undertake such a study in a population where almost one in five of the adult population has a marker of infection seems extremely risky,” McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He also questioned whether participants could truly give informed consent, given the ethical concerns about how the study is being conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent survey, about 18% of Bissau-Guinean adults had hepatitis B, a virus that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, especially among young children. If a baby is infected in the first year of life, there is a 90% chance they will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer; between the ages of one and five, there is a 25% chance. Among adults, about 5% have a chronic infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39187275/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of toddlers in Guinea-Bissau, about 11.2% already had hepatitis B infection, which means not enough babies are getting the shots, said Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford. Across sub-Saharan Africa, only about 17% of babies receive the recommended birth dose, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The priority should be to increase vaccination with the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and protect more babies from the risk posed by this virus,” Pollard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the US, recommending the vaccine at birth to all babies – not just those who appeared to be at risk of infection – caused rates among children to drop precipitously, from 20,000 to about 20 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We virtually eliminated hepatitis B in children less than 10,” Offit said. Children may be infected at birth, but they may also come into contact with other children and adults carrying the virus – which can remain infectious on surfaces for up to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The experts voiced concerns about how the study would take place. It is unusual for a trial like this to take place in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea-bissau" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt; instead of the United States or Denmark, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Why on Earth is this study happening in a high-endemic setting where the birth dose matters the most?” Yamey asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Denmark, where only &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36221255/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;three in 1,000&lt;/a&gt; people have the virus, the shot is not currently recommended at birth either, which means the same study could be conducted there. Denmark also has health registries, making it easier to access complete medical records. Instead, by working in a country with precarious healthcare and high rates of the illness, studies like this may lead to “expanding distrust in global public health”, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US canceled much of its global aid and research earlier this year, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In the face of the US canceling all this funding for vulnerable countries, and then it’s still going to pay for this research to be done – that is really worrying,” she said. “It seems to say we don’t value your lives enough to continue to provide support overall, but we won’t hesitate to experiment with your population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study is single-blinded, which means the patients will not know who got the vaccine and who didn’t, but the research team will – which can affect the way they collect and interpret the data. “This means they can stamp their own biases on the results,” Yamey said. And the endpoints – “overall health effects” – are “very squishy”, which leaves the results vulnerable to manipulation, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Henrik Støvring, a professor of statistics and pharmacometrics at Aarhus University who co-wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red flags&lt;/a&gt; in Bandim Health Project research for the journal Vaccine this month, said “broad hypotheses like these carry a high risk of false positive findings, and in general the research group has previously been reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods to curb such a risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think conflicts of interests are always an issue when the donor so explicitly seeks out a research group and funds a study,” Støvring said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård has also &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about major issues with research conducted by Aaby and Stabell Benn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After the CDC sparked outrage by changing the recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination with no evidence, Jacobs said, “they’re now funding this to try to give themselves cover for having done that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Because &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; is an anti-vaccine zealot, he will somehow contort that study to look like the hepatitis B birth dose causes harm” or that it is better to delay the shots, Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists, doctors and medical organizations are speaking out against Kennedy, he said, but “this is a political problem, and it requires a political solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the meantime, children will bear the brunt of these decisions, Offit continued: “This breaks my heart. It really does. It’s hard to sleep knowing that children are constantly being put in harm’s way by the administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPMklZRDZ3YzROa0xGdVdzQkJlLXA4U0hTV3F6S0pCSUZURTF0WFlvdUNpZ2ZUN3ZHQXNvaWlOZnRQV2dMYnlYaWFkSlQ0R1BIVEIwTDdLczRTRk1EX1ZsV05iMWpKSHduVjN4ZlF2WXZKLW1VeW0yRWg2SkU4TTgyRnJCdnhsaVA3THFNVkszSVpHRWpxRUE</guid></item><item><title>奶酪可能有助于避免痴呆症，建议对超过25年的2.7万人进行研究-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cheese-may-help-stave-off-dementia-suggests-study-of-27k-people-followed-over-25-years/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Sweden found a link between eating more high-fat cream and high-fat cheeses and a lower risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who consumed 20 grams or more of high-fat cream daily had a 16% lower risk of dementia than those who consumed none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who ate 50 grams or more of high-fat cheese—containing more than 20% fat—had a 13% lower risk of dementia than those eating less than 15 grams daily, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No association was found for low-fat dairy products, butter, milk or fermented milk, which includes yoghurt, kefir and buttermilk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that the study, published in the journal Neurology, does not prove that eating high-fat cheese and high-fat cream lowers the risk of dementia, it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For decades, the debate over high-fat versus low-fat diets has shaped health advice, sometimes even categorizing cheese as an unhealthy food to limit,” said Professor Emily Sonestedt, of Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study found that some high-fat dairy products may actually lower the risk of dementia, challenging some long-held assumptions about fat and brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers analysed data from 27,670 people in Sweden with an average age of 58 at the start of the study. They were followed for an average of 25 years. A total of 3,208 participants developed dementia during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants kept track of what they ate for a week and answered questions about how often they ate certain foods during recent years. They also talked with researchers about how they prepared their food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical serving of cheese is one ounce. Of those who ate more high-fat cheese, 10% developed dementia by the end of the study. Of those who ate less, 13% developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, sex, education and overall diet quality, the research team found that people who ate more high-fat cheese had a 13% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those who ate less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific types of dementia, they found people who ate more high-fat cheese had a 29% lower risk of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers&lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/full-fat-cheese-linked-lower-risk-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; also found&lt;/a&gt; a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease among those who ate more high-fat cheese, but only among those not carrying the APOE e4 gene variant, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also compared people who consumed 20 grams or more of high-fat cream daily to people who consumed none. After similar adjustments, researchers found that those who consumed high-fat cream daily had a 16% lower risk of dementia compared to those who consumed none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, observational studies that show links and associations are not considered useful unless the association reaches above 60%. In that sense, the value of the findings is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO CHEESE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="26 Years of Research Shows Cardiovascular Health in Dairy Lovers is Not Aversely Affected by Choosing Cheese" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cheese-actually-reduces-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-provides-a-lot-of-health-benefits/" rel="bookmark"&gt;26 Years of Research Shows Cardiovascular Health in Dairy Lovers is Not Aversely Affected by Choosing Cheese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthy user bias is a feature of observational studies that can affect the outcome. It describes a phenomenon whereby people who are willing to make one choice regarding their health are more likely to make others, and that as their potential effects become difficult to separate out of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, one would guess a study influenced by healthy user bias would find a negative association with cheese and cream, since those who eat no cheese or cream will usually be making that choice in conjunction with several others to try and improve health, such as exercise or a higher quantity of vegetables at meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Trendy Type of Norwegian Cheese May Stave Off Bone Thinning, Shows New Study" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/norwegian-cheese-may-stave-off-bone-thinning/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Trendy Type of Norwegian Cheese May Stave Off Bone Thinning, Shows New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who don’t focus on health in their lifestyle and diet choices won’t exclude cheese cream—an inference because they won’t make any other choices. The results, being counter-intuitive, make the study results compelling even if the association with dementia was small&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fermented foods like yogurt and kefir, generally eaten for health reasons, showing no association only adds to the curious direction the data took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team says further research is needed to explore whether consuming certain high-fat dairy offers some level of protection for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE CHEESE NEWS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="First Ever Cheese Museum Opens in Paris: ‘It’s Gouda Brie a Delicious Visit’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-first-ever-cheese-museum-opens-in-paris-see-learn-and-taste-of-course/" rel="bookmark"&gt;First Ever Cheese Museum Opens in Paris: ‘It’s Gouda Brie a Delicious Visit’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that when it comes to brain health not all dairy is equal,” said Professor Sonestedt. “More research is needed to confirm our study results and further explore whether consuming certain high-fat dairy truly offers some level of protection for the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonestedt noted that in Sweden, cheese is often eaten uncooked, while in the United States, cheese is often heated or eaten with meat. She says it is important that studies also be conducted in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Light movement after eating is one of the best ways to blunt your body’s blood sugar response to a meal. “Walking after eating is effective because it helps your body use the glucose from your meal right away, instead of letting it build up in your bloodstream,” says diabetes educator &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, M.S., RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, she points out, exercise also diverts blood flow away from the intestines, lessening glucose absorption. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research supports the idea of heading out for a short walk. One small study found that a 10-minute walk right after eating effectively lowered blood glucose levels in healthy young adults better than a control group who rested instead.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Plus, the effects of a 10-minute walk were similar to a 30-minute walk, so researchers recommend the shorter stroll for being more practical for daily life. And in research involving people with type 2 diabetes, physical activity done right after a meal is also effective in lowering blood sugar—and may be a sound strategy for improving long-term blood sugar management.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Can’t get outside? That’s OK. Move around your home, whether that’s light housework, clearing the table or doing the dishes, recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/grace-a-derocha" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Grace Derocha, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Personally, she saves her laundry for after a meal, which gives her a task that requires going up and down the stairs. That’s a great idea, too, as one study found that one to three minutes of stair climbing improved after-meal insulin and glucose levels.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Drink Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drink up after a meal—but make it water. Ideally, you’ll also be drinking water throughout the meal, too. “Drinking water can help, but it won’t stop a spike on its own—it’s more of a gentle support strategy than a powerful intervention like walking,” says Kimberlain. Hydration helps by assisting your kidneys in removing excess glucose from the bloodstream, she explains. Staying hydrated helps to maintain normal blood volume, which is also impactful for blood sugar levels. “Drinking water dilutes the concentration and supports more stable numbers,” Kimberlain says.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Add a Healthy Fruit Dessert &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You finished your main meal—now what? “I recommend adding a ‘finishing fiber or fruit,’” recommends Derocha. “Certain foods that we eat can support a smoother glucose response, as well as digestion.” She recommends having a high-fiber fruit (such as berries) or fiber-rich dessert (such as chia seed pudding). Fiber helps slow down the absorption of carbohydrate foods from the meal.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And sometimes you just need a little something sweet to tell you that you’re done. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not into sweet, finishing the dinner with a fermented food like kimchi is another idea, says Derocha. Fermented foods may help regulate glucose metabolism, and their probiotic properties aid in digestion and reduce inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Other Everyday Habits for Healthy Blood Sugar Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Follow these tips throughout the day to keep blood sugar levels in check:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the simplest things you can do to reduce spikes is eat more fiber, says Kimberlain. Doing so helps prevent glucose from entering your bloodstream quickly. Ultimately, higher-fiber meals will keep after-meal glucose levels steadier, she says. Oatmeal with berries, beans in a salad, and quinoa, farro and sweet potatoes at dinner are all examples of fiber-rich options.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a balanced plate: &lt;/strong&gt;When planning your meals, complex carbohydrates, lean protein, healthy fats and fiber are an ideal combination for healthy blood sugar, says Kimberlain. Plus, this type of plate also helps keep you full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat foods in order. &lt;/strong&gt;“The order that we eat food can help impact the glucose response in the body,” says Derocha. She advises eating vegetables and protein before carbohydrate foods (like rice, potatoes or bread) to slow digestion and reduce a spike.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay active: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for 50 minutes of moderate- or vigorous-intensity cardio with resistance exercise to strengthen muscles and bones at least three days per week. Plus, limit sedentary screen time.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;This includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. If you need help quitting, ask your doctor for a referral for treatment for tobacco cessation and possible medication.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve your sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Relaxing pre-bed routines, keeping a regular bedtime and wake-up time, sleeping in a dark, quiet, cool area, putting your devices on silent and avoiding alcohol before bed all help improve sleep quality—which is necessary for proper blood sugar management.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To blunt a rise in blood sugar after a meal, the most powerful thing you can do is take a short, 10-minute walk right after eating. In addition, hydrating during and after the meal, as well as chasing the meal with a high-fiber fruit, can also help decrease the rise in glucose that happens after eating, as well as support your body’s ability to get rid of glucose. Blood sugar management is an all-day thing, though, so remember to eat balanced meals containing fiber-rich carbohydrates, lean protein and healthy fat, exercise regularly and get good sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://media.mauinow.com/file/mauinow/2025/12/256545559_l-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510871"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, in accordance with Ordinance 5759 adopted by the Maui County Council, the County of Maui Department of Water Supply (DWS) will implement a new method for projecting water demand and sizing water meters that focuses on daily water usage instead of the Hunter Curve Method, which was based on the number of plumbing fixtures—such as toilets or showers—in a building. The new method will apply to building permit applications and applications for new or additional water use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new approach is a form of the water demand equivalent method, establishes a unit of daily water demand called the Equivalent Single Dwelling (ESD), and estimates daily water consumption based established patterns of human habitation correlating to the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a home, counting any room that is, or could reasonably be, used for sleeping as a bedroom. In addition to the total ESDs associated with a service, each service will be allocated an additional 0.5 ESD to account for outdoor water use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyzing empirical local meter data, per-capita usage and national per person daily use averages, DWS developed a model for daily water usage based on a range of bedroom and bathroom combinations accounting for typical household activities such as dishwashing, laundry, bathing and general human consumption. From this analysis, the department established a fixed daily usage unit of 300 gallons per day for one ESD, based on a four-bed, two-bath home&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new method provides a more accurate way to measure water demand, which may show additional available capacity under the 300 gallons per day per ESD standard, but it does not increase the total water supply on Maui. This approach helps DWS plan and manage water resources more realistically while continuing to address the island’s ongoing water challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak mobile-only mobileFullWidth"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1615054580015-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new methodology allows DWS to more accurately measure water demand and ensure properties are appropriately sized for safe and reliable water service,” said DWS Director John Stufflebean. “It supports Maui’s long-term water management goals, helps make the process more straightforward, and reinforces our commitment to serving the community reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Family Homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For single-family residences, DWS has established standard meter capacities to simplify the process:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5/8-inch meter: up to 2.5 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;3/4-inch meter: up to 3.5 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;1-inch meter: up to 6 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Family Homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mn_videoad" class="ad_video ad_video_homepage mobileFullWidth ad_video_v2"&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="mn_videoad_holder"&gt;&lt;video playsinline webkit-playsinline id="vastplayer" muted="muted" loop="true"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-family projects use the same bedroom-and-bathroom methodology as single-family homes, with outdoor water use estimated separately; however, because multifamily buildings have different water-use patterns than single-family homes, meter sizing is based on modeling using the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) Water Demand Calculator (WDC), reflecting their unique water-use patterns. Models of different multifamily projects with varying unit counts were used to develop a sizing curve, which informs DWS’s standard meter table:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For multi-family residences, DWS has established standard meter capacities as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;·         1-inch meter: up to 16 ESD&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5-inch meter: up to 60 ESD&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;2-inch meter: up to 120 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;3-inch meter: up to 240 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers may use the standard table or submit custom WDC calculations for meter sizing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak mobileFullWidth"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Residential Properties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For non-residential properties, water demand is based on custom calculations prepared and signed by a licensed professional. Developers must provide indoor water-use estimates as well as landscape irrigation calculations, including plant types, the area covered by each type, and anticipated daily or monthly water use. Developers may use the EPA WaterSense Water Budget Calculator to assist with outdoor water estimates. DWS will convert all information into ESDs for permitting and meter sizing, and custom calculations also determine the meter issued along with any associated storage and transmission fees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak mobile-only mobileFullWidth"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1615054580015-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak desktop-only"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1615054580015-1" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation and Transition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Existing multifamily and non-residential meters retain ESD entitlements based on their current approved use or the FY2026 source fee equivalent of $2,316 per ESD, whichever is greater. DWS will not reduce existing entitlements or require reconciliation for customers whose entitlements exceed fees paid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To assist with the application process, the updated ESD Methodology and a Materials Submission Checklist will be available at &lt;a href="http://www.mauicounty.gov/214/Engineering-Division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;www.mauicounty.gov/214/Engineering-Division&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Applications submitted on or before Dec. 31, 2025, will continue under the current fixture-based method. Applications submitted on or after Jan. 1, 2026, will use the new unit demand methodology. Additional fixtures or ESDs will not be available for purchase under the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;

Cardinal lives in a town in British Columbia with strong counter-cultural roots. “The community that I live in, home birth is something a lot of women prioritise,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then Cardinal stumbled across a podcast from the Free Birth Society (FBS). One episode in particular, she says, made an impact: “Unpacking Ultrasound With Yolande Clark.” In it, the Canadian ex-doula Yolande Norris-Clark falsely links ultrasounds to autism and ADHD and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_t0fi47M7o" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;states that&lt;/a&gt; “ultrasound damages and modifies and destroys cells”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="095cc2d4-a2ab-4c92-b82c-76b24583258a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Yolande Norris-Clark in an episode of The Complete Guide to Freebirth.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: FBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark, who was born in Vancouver, is arguably the most famous freebirth influencer in the world. She is also a key figure in FBS, a US company run by her business partner and fellow ex-doula Emilee Saldaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;FBS, which promotes an extreme version of free birth in which women abandon any form of prenatal care and give birth without doctors or midwives present, is estimated to have generated more than $13m in revenues since 2018. A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/nov/22/free-birth-society-linked-to-babies-deaths-investigation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent Guardian investigation&lt;/a&gt; identified 48 cases of late-term stillbirths or neonatal deaths or other forms of serious harm involving mothers or birth attendants who appear to be linked to FBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The intellectual heft behind FBS, Norris-Clark shaped the organisation’s radical position on birth, while Saldaya, its founder, runs the business. Most women find FBS through its Instagram account, which has 132,000 followers, or podcast, which has been downloaded 5m times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Norris-Clark is a significant social media influencer in her own right, pioneering a radical version of free birth that concerns even pro-freebirth advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a05cf2da-67e1-4f89-ad4b-0f8d06538477" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emma Cardinal: ‘You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Annika Faith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After listening to the podcast about ultrasounds, Cardinal was alarmed. “I was petrified of miscarriage and stillbirth,” she says, explaining that her younger brother was stillborn. “There’s not a chance I’m risking that.” Cardinal came to believe ultrasounds “aren’t super safe for the baby”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At that stage, Cardinal had not yet decided to freebirth. She phoned a local midwifery practice and explained that she wanted a home birth, but did not want to have any ultrasounds during her pregnancy. But the receptionist, Cardinal recalls, said that if she wanted to give birth with them, ultrasounds were non-negotiable. Cardinal thought about it, and decided she was not comfortable proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, after listening to about 100 episodes of the FBS podcast, Cardinal decided to freebirth. In one journal entry, she wrote: “I know it in my bones that freebirthing is my safest and most liberated option.” She purchased FBS’s popular video course, “The Complete Guide to Freebirth”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardinal’s son Floyd was stillborn in March 2024. During labour Cardinal saw meconium in her waters, a possible sign of distress, but dismissed it because “I was told by FBS that meconium is totally normal”. She stayed home for three days, because “I remember hearing Emilee Saldaya’s voice in my head [from the podcasts], saying: ‘I wouldn’t be concerned for the first three days.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After Floyd died, Cardinal was hospitalised with sepsis and placed in an induced coma. She has had a number of surgeries to repair the damage from his birth, and had to wear an ostomy bag for a time. “I didn’t think that could even be a reality that could happen after birth,” she says. “I almost had to have a hysterectomy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d2f96779-40b9-47cc-9067-22cca6fa54f1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emma Cardinal in hospital after her first ostomy surgery, nine months after the stillbirth of Floyd.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Annika Faith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Looking back, Cardinal believes that much of the information she received from FBS was “incomplete, biased, one-sided and kind of dogmatic”. This includes the information she received on ultrasounds, &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/uog.6328" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;which are not harmful&lt;/a&gt; to unborn babies when used appropriately. She adds: “You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark has not responded to repeated requests for comment about the Guardian’s investigation, which is told through &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-birth-keepers-the-guardian-investigates/id1731314182" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Birth Keepers podcast series&lt;/a&gt;. She has previously defended her partnership with Saldaya, saying FBS is “the most ethical kind of business you can run”. Critics of FBS, she has said, fail to understand the commitment to women taking “radical responsibility” for their births. And she has said it is unfair to hold her responsible for the choices of a mother who consumes her content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-birth-keepers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the spotlight on tragedies involving mothers&lt;/a&gt; around the world who consumed FBS content is posing a crisis for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Saldaya has also not provided a substantive response to requests for comment, but told the Guardian in one email that “some of these allegations are false or defamatory”. She has previously responded to criticism by saying she does not care if women freebirth, but wants them to have the choice. In recent comments to her followers, she described the Guardian’s reporting as “propaganda” based on “lies”, and suggested her work, words and character had been misrepresented by “twisted, dark attacks”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c3da89e0-6a5e-4f61-ac30-c33a9714c6d0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emilee Saldaya pictured in a screengrab of the Free Birth Society website.&lt;/span&gt; Composite: FBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardinal is not the only Canadian woman to lose their child after an FBS-influenced free birth. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; has universal healthcare, it is a sparsely populated country, with large “midwifery deserts”. Alternative communities can be sceptical of licensed professionals. As in other parts of the world, FBS messaging often resonates with women who have had traumatic experiences of maternity services or unnecessary medical interventions&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The Covid pandemic also eroded many women’s trust in the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not all of the women who want to avoid licensed providers are ready to freebirth. Some turn to unlicensed attendants, believing they offer their best chance to avoid hospital for their birth. Canada has a community of unlicensed birth attendants, in part due to the historic status of midwifery in the nation. Unlike other countries with strong cultures of midwifery, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, Canada has lagged behind other developed nations when it comes to recognising midwifery. Midwives and their clients can sometimes encounter scepticism, or even hostility, from healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is in this context that women turn to unlicensed attendants, some of whom, while unregulated, are skilled and experienced underground midwives. But others – such as those who enrolled only in a brief online FBS course – have limited or no experience of births, and no adequate skills for managing potential emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-actually-dont-believe-gravity-is-true" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;‘I actually don’t believe gravity is true’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most popular of FBS’s schools, the Radical Birthkeeper School, has trained 850 “authentic midwives” from more than 30 countries. On its three-month Zoom course, only about half the content deals with birth, and the rest focuses on self-development and business skills. There are at least 22 FBS-accredited birth keepers in Canada, according to an online directory seen by the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;FBS advises its radical birth keepers – or RBKs – to get out in the world and begin attending births. “The very best way to learn how to do midwifery is by doing midwifery,” Saldaya told her RBK students in 2025. Many have since set up their own businesses supporting women during their free births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alexandra Smith, 29, a life coach who hired an FBS-trained RBK for her birth, is from Vancouver Island. “It’s a different way of thinking out here. People prefer to be off grid,” Smith explains. “It’s a holistic space, with lots of hippies, everyone is about free birth and Waldorf education.” Norris-Clark, she adds, is “very popular where I live”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She says women in her area see Norris-Clark as the “founding mother” of free birth, who has “brought a solution to systemic problems” in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During her pregnancy, Smith says, she listened to the FBS podcast regularly, sometimes multiple episodes a day, and that she found Norris-Clark particularly captivating. Were it not for FBS, she says, she would have had a home birth with a midwife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3a1ef88e-4d12-464b-a311-803df2969232" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Alexandra Smith with a painting of her son Aksel.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Odessa Rae&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of the women who follow Norris-Clark on social media, seeking advice in their pregnancies, are unaware of her more extreme views, which she sometimes revealed to FBS students. “I actually don’t believe that gravity is true,” she told FBS students in 2024, adding: “Maybe that just makes me crazy and that’s totally OK.” In another class, she told students they could cut a baby’s umbilical cord with an “old rusty fork”. “I don’t believe in germ theory,” she said, “I don’t believe in contagion,” adding: “But even if contagion were real … there would be a pretty much 0% chance of anything happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Such radical beliefs are not part of FBS’s slick advertising and promotional materials. Smith says she believed, based on FBS marketing, that RBKs were “trained, unregistered midwives”. “I feel like I was falsely advertised to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;(Others have made similar complaints about FBS. Earlier this year a lawyer for FBS responded to a consumer protection complaint filed in North Carolina alleging a course was mis-sold by stating that the company had always been transparent that it was offering “personal development and sovereign-birth related education” rather than certified midwifery training.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The RBK who Smith hired to attend her during her free birth was in her mid-20s. In a video testimonial she filmed for the RBK school, which had been available online until recently, she said the school “wasn’t your typical school in that it provides hard facts, information, data, and all of that stuff. It was different in that what I gained from the experience was this deep trust in birth, the deep sense of knowing that birth unfolds beautifully if we just step out of the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When it came to the birth, Smith alleges her RBK was woefully underprepared and “like a deer in headlights”. The RBK, Smith says, missed signs her labour was unfolding abnormally. When Smith’s son Aksel was born on 7 May 2023, his umbilical cord was white, and he was floppy and unresponsive. The RBK, she says, did not attempt to resuscitate the baby, and Smith had to tell her to call 911. Aksel was rushed to hospital, and diagnosed with severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy due to oxygen deprivation caused by a placental abruption at his birth. The RBK has not responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="legal-cases-and-public-warnings" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Legal cases and public warnings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As unlicensed attendants, including those trained by FBS, proliferate across Canada, the authorities are seeking to clamp down on the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Vancouver Island, Canada’s most famous unlicensed birth attendant, Gloria Lemay, 78, is awaiting trial for manslaughter after a girl died 10 days after her birth, which Lemay attended, in January 2024. It is her latest legal battle in a near five-decade long career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1986, Lemay was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12289431/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;convicted of criminal negligence&lt;/a&gt; causing death after a baby was born dead at a birth she attended, although she was later acquitted, with the supreme court upholding a lower court’s judgment that a child that is not yet born cannot be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12289431/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;considered a person&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, after a baby boy died of an infection three days after a birth attended by Lemay, she was fined $1,000 for refusing to answer questions at the inquest. In 2002, Lemay &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.319144" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;was found&lt;/a&gt; in contempt of an order prohibiting her from acting as a midwife. She was arrested in relation to the most recent case in January 2025. A case management conference is scheduled for January 2026. Lemay declined to comment on her upcoming trial, but it is understood she plans to contest the charges and plead not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e13efbdf-671e-435e-b41e-97d7084ec8db" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Gloria Lemay trained Yolande Norris-Clark as a doula.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark always credits Lemay with inspiring her lifelong passion for birth. Lemay attended Norris-Clark’s first two births, and trained her as a doula. However those familiar with both women’s careers say Norris-Clark’s views on birth are more extreme than those of her one-time mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemay remains a highly divisive figure. Viewed by some in the medical establishment as a dangerous charlatan, she is equally beloved by many in the birth world, who regard her as a folk hero comparable to the legendary US midwife Ina May Gaskin. The Birth Care Alliance, a campaign to counter what it says is the “systemic overreach into birth sovereignty and midwifery”, is fundraising for her defence. (So too is Norris-Clark, who has described Lemay’s trial as “the attempted martyrdom of a cherished elder”.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemay’s supporters say she wished to retire years ago, but was repeatedly asked to attend births by women who wanted to give birth outside the system. They say she is highly skilled, supports medical transfer when necessary, and has attended thousands of births in her career, of which only very few ended in tragedy. To her detractors, Lemay is a thorn in the side of the medical establishment, and the authorities have repeatedly targeted her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Canadian health authorities are also warning about less famous, and considerably less skilled, attendants, some of whom are FBS-affiliated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2023 the British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives put out an advisory notice warning the public about the RBK hired by Smith, saying she was not entitled to practise as a midwife, and that she could be offering midwifery services without being permitted to do so. (The Guardian has seen no evidence that she continued to attend births after Smith’s in May 2023.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The following year, a different FBS-linked birth attendant was banned from hospitals across Alberta unless she was seeking medical care for herself or her family. The woman, who marketed herself as a “traditional midwife”, had been a member of the FBS membership community and appeared as a guest on its podcast. A number of complaints were filed against her by concerned staff at two Calgary hospitals after she was linked to two stillbirths in 2021. (Her lawyer told the Guardian that her birth services have been limited to non-medical support.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith’s son Aksel spent five weeks in hospital before being discharged in June 2023. Deprived of oxygen during birth, he had severe disabilities and was fed through a tube.

    &lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db521.htm"&gt;leading cause of death in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since researchers first established the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14364826/"&gt;link between diet, cholesterol and heart disease in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;, risk for heart disease has been partly assessed based on a patient’s cholesterol levels, which can be routinely measured via blood work at the doctor’s office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.CIR.97.20.2007"&gt;accumulating evidence over the past two decades&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that a biomarker called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/23056-c-reactive-protein-crp-test"&gt;C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt; – which signals the presence of low-grade inflammation – is a better predictor of risk for heart disease than cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, in September 2025, the American College of Cardiology published &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.047"&gt;new recommendations for universal screening of&lt;/a&gt; C-reactive protein levels in all patients, alongside measuring cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is C-reactive protein?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C-reactive protein is created by the liver in response to infections, tissue damage, chronic inflammatory states from conditions like autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disturbances like obesity and diabetes. Essentially, it is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2206346"&gt;marker of inflammation&lt;/a&gt; – meaning &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-inflammation-two-immunologists-explain-how-the-body-responds-to-everything-from-stings-to-vaccination-and-why-it-sometimes-goes-wrong-193503"&gt;immune system activation&lt;/a&gt; – in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C-reactive protein can be easily measured with blood work at the doctor’s office. A low C-reactive protein level – under 1 milligram per deciliter – signifies minimal inflammation in the body, which is protective against heart disease. An elevated C-reactive protein level of greater than 3 milligrams per deciliter, signifies increased levels of inflammation and thus &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11092444"&gt;increased risk for heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. About 52% of Americans have an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM200504143521525"&gt;elevated level of C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt; in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research shows that C-reactive protein is a better predictive marker for heart attacks and strokes than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2405182"&gt;“bad,” or LDL cholesterol, short for low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, as well as another commonly measured genetically inherited biomarker called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2405182"&gt;lipoprotein(a)&lt;/a&gt;. One study found that C-reactive protein &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61717-7"&gt;can predict heart disease just as well as blood pressure can&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why does inflammation matter in heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflammation plays a crucial role at every stage in the development and buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which causes a condition called &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; that can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/hc0902.104353"&gt;lead to heart attacks and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the moment a blood vessel is damaged, be it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.71433"&gt;from high blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2613.2000.00162.x"&gt;cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt;, immune cells immediately infiltrate the area. Those immune cells subsequently engulf cholesterol particles that are typically floating around in the blood stream to form a fatty plaque that resides in the wall of the vessel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process continues for decades until eventually, one day, immune mediators rupture the cap that encloses the plaque. This triggers the formation of a blood clot that obstructs blood flow, starves the surrounding tissues of oxygen and ultimately causes a heart attack or stroke.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, cholesterol is only part of the story; it is, in fact, the immune system that facilitates each step in the processes that drive heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Fatty plaque buildup in the arteries causes a blockage that starves tissues of oxygen and can lead to a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can diet influence C-reactive protein levels?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle can significantly influence the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319885458"&gt;amount of C-reactive protein produced by the liver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous foods and nutrients have been shown to lower C-reactive protein levels, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2014.959898"&gt;dietary fiber from foods like beans, vegetables, nuts and seeds&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.110922"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2025.2525446"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2019.08.019"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-024-00847-3"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2024.106868"&gt;flaxseeds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.167.1.31"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2016-095999"&gt;and exercise&lt;/a&gt; can also reduce C-reactive protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/709795/original/file-20251218-56-si5ozt.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Diet plays a key role in heart disease risk.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/food-products-representing-the-dash-diet-royalty-free-image/2176934394?phrase=heart%20disease%20risk&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;monticelllo/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Does cholesterol still matter for heart disease risk?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though cholesterol may not be the most important predictor of risk for heart disease, it does remain highly relevant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not just the amount of cholesterol – or more specifically the amount of bad, or LDL, cholesterol – that matters. Two people with the same cholesterol level don’t necessarily have the same risk for heart disease. This is because risk is determined more so by the number of particles that the bad cholesterol is packaged into, as opposed to the total mass of bad cholesterol that’s floating around. &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.068885"&gt;More particles means higher risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is why a blood test known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24992-apolipoprotein-b-test"&gt;apolipoprotein B&lt;/a&gt;, which measures the number of cholesterol particles, is a better predictor of risk for heart disease than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.5083"&gt;measurements of total amounts of bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like cholesterol and C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B is also influenced by lifestyle factors &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1055/a-2580-0722"&gt;like exercise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-019-1094-4"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and diet. Nutrients like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954422416000147"&gt;fiber, nuts and omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; are associated with a decreased number of cholesterol particles, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9030211"&gt;increased sugar intake is associated with a larger number&lt;/a&gt; of cholesterol particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/genetic-conditions/lipoprotein-a"&gt;lipoprotein(a)&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that lives in the wall surrounding cholesterol particles, is another marker that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/ATV.0000000000000147"&gt;can predict heart disease more accurately than cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. This is because the presence of lipoprotein(a) makes cholesterol particles sticky, so to speak, and thus more likely to get trapped in an atherosclerotic plaque. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unlike other risk factors, lipoprotein(a) levels are purely genetic, thus not influenced by lifestyle, and need only be measured once in a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s the best way to prevent heart disease?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, heart disease is the product of many risk factors and their interactions over a lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, preventing heart disease is way more complicated than &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/128.2.449S"&gt;simply eating a cholesterol-free diet, as once thought&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing your LDL cholesterol level alongside your C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein (a) levels paints a comprehensive picture of risk that can hopefully help motivate long-term commitment to the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/how-to-help-prevent-heart-disease-at-any-age"&gt;fundamentals of heart disease prevention&lt;/a&gt;. These include eating well, exercising consistently, getting adequate sleep, managing stress productively, maintaining healthy weight and, if applicable, quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

But it’s not just gluttony for gluttony’s sake. There’s a physiological reason December leaves so many of us feeling, well, inflated. “Bloating occurs when the digestive system struggles to efficiently break down and move &lt;a href="/topic/food"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;,” says Wilkinson. “During the Christmas period, this is particularly common as people consume larger portions, eat a wider variety of foods and often stray from their usual routine.” In other words, it’s not you; it’s your gut, desperately trying to keep up with the sudden influx of roast potatoes, cheese boards, cocktails, canapes and late-night leftovers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? “There are simple, natural ways to support digestion and reduce feelings of heaviness and discomfort in the gut,” Wilkinson explains. Certain foods contain the enzymes, fibres and beneficial &lt;a href="/topic/bacteria"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that “help the gut work at its best, even when festive indulgences are at their peak”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilkinson has five recommendations for foods that don’t demand restriction or reinvention of saintly behaviour, yet can still stop your Christmas from feeling like one very long, slow-moving meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fermented foods: the microbiome’s festive rescue squad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/48/iStock-2212401124.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A forkful of fermented food is the simplest way to stop the Christmas buffet fighting back" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188117"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A forkful of fermented food is the simplest way to stop the Christmas buffet fighting back&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fermented foods are one of the most effective ways to naturally support digestion,” Wilkinson says. “Foods like probiotic-rich yoghurts, sauerkraut, kimchi and kombucha contain ‘healthy bacteria’ designed to help maintain a balanced gut &lt;a href="/topic/microbiome"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That microbiome takes a beating in December: more alcohol, more sugar, less &lt;a href="/topic/fibre"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt; and less routine. It’s chaos for the trillions of microbes that normally keep our digestion humming along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When these foods are eaten regularly,” Wilkinson adds, “they introduce this healthy bacteria to the gut, supporting the breakdown of food while reducing gas production and digestive discomfort.” Essentially, they can soften the blow of the Christmas buffet before it lands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented foods also keep things moving, essential when your mealtimes resemble a tasting menu without an endpoint. “Probiotics also help regulate bowel movements, which is particularly important during a month when eating patterns can become irregular.” A spoonful of sauerkraut or a morning kefir is hardly the height of festive glamour, but neither is feeling like your stomach has turned into a snow globe someone won’t stop shaking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And crucially, they don’t need to be eaten in huge quantities to make a difference. If fermented food simply isn’t your vibe, Wilkinson suggests “making use of gut-friendly supplements” with ingredients like milk thistle, silymarin and dandelion, such as Dr Vegan’s Debloat and Detox range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ginger: the digestive accelerator your stomach will thank you for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/11/iStock-1406731310.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Ginger: the tiny root doing the heavy lifting after your third cheese course" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188118"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Ginger: the tiny root doing the heavy lifting after your third cheese course&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If fermented foods are the slow-and-steady helpers, &lt;a href="/topic/ginger"&gt;ginger&lt;/a&gt; is the fast-acting first responder. “Ginger has long been used around the world to support digestion and ease digestive discomfort,” Wilkinson says. It works on a mechanical level, not just a folkloric one. “It contains natural compounds that help stimulate the digestive tract and encourage efficient ‘gastric emptying’.” That means food doesn’t linger in the stomach for hours, which is precisely when bloating and fullness set in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When food leaves the stomach more steadily, feelings of bloating and fullness are significantly reduced,” she adds. It’s particularly helpful at Christmas because zingibain – the enzyme in ginger – “helps to break down proteins”. Which, when you consider the sheer volume of meat, cheese, nuts and canapes consumed in December, feels less like a nice-to-have and more like festive survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps that ginger is easy to weave into your routine without feeling like a health kick. “Fresh ginger tea made with hot water, lemon and grated ginger is a soothing option after meals, and ginger can also be added to smoothies, soups or stir-fries for an effortless digestive boost throughout the week.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oats: the quiet hero of a comfortable December&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dfOhoE"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/35/iStock-2214074450.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A bowl of oats – the calm, steadying counterbalance to December’s chaos" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188119"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A bowl of oats – the calm, steadying counterbalance to December’s chaos&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re oscillating wildly between sugar highs and gravy-induced slumps, oats might be the grounding force your gut needs. “Oats are one of the most beneficial, affordable foods for maintaining steady, comfortable digestion,” says Wilkinson. While December eating is heavy on refined carbohydrates and low on fibre, oats do the opposite. They provide slow-release energy and the kind of soluble fibre your digestive system is crying out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They contain beta-glucans, a type of soluble fibre that supports digestive regularity, maintains healthy gut bacteria and helps reduce inflammation in the digestive tract.” That means fewer spikes and crashes, a more cooperative gut and, crucially, less of the bloating that creeps in when your body is overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beginning the day with porridge or overnight oats can make a meaningful difference to digestive comfort throughout the festive period,” she says. The stabilised blood sugar also “reduces energy crashes and cravings that can lead to further overeating”. Translation: a bowl of porridge might save you from inhaling half a yule log at 11am because you “haven’t eaten anything yet”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Papaya: the enzyme-packed surprise entry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hYlFdB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/01/iStock-914617584.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Papaya brings enzyme power to a month built almost entirely on protein and dairy" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188120"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Papaya brings enzyme power to a month built almost entirely on protein and dairy&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papaya might not be the first thing you reach for in December, but Wilkinson argues it should be. “Papaya is rich in an enzyme called papain, which helps break down proteins and supports smoother, more comfortable digestion.” This is particularly relevant when your regular meals have been replaced with turkey sandwiches, cheese selections and yet another portion of pigs in blankets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Beyond its enzyme benefits, papaya offers hydration, fibre and antioxidants,” she says. “These elements work together to reduce irritation in the digestive tract and contribute to regular bowel movements.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh papaya is best, “though dried papaya can also offer benefits as long as it is consumed in moderation and with minimal added sugars”. It’s worth noting her caveat that “papaya is not recommended for pregnant women”, a crucial detail often missed in wellness content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apples: the humble digestive workhorse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/12/11/11/25/iStock-2184346751.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The humble apple quietly outperforms most festive ‘gut fixes’ – and costs far less" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-188121"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The humble apple quietly outperforms most festive ‘gut fixes’ – and costs far less&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While papaya brings the drama, &lt;a href="/topic/apples"&gt;apples&lt;/a&gt; bring the reliability. “Apples are one of the simplest yet most effective foods for easing bloating and supporting a healthy gut,” Wilkinson says. They’re rich in pectin, “a form of soluble fibre that absorbs water and helps move food steadily through the digestive tract.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steady movement is key. It prevents the “bunged up” feeling that often defines the later stages of December, when meals begin to stack on top of each other. Apples also contain natural prebiotics, “especially in the core”, which help strengthen the microbiome and improve digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, Wilkinson specifies that “eating apples raw will benefit your digestive system most, though they can also be blended into smoothies and even baked into desserts”. They are, quite simply, the easiest festive gut support going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A gentler, less bloated Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, no single food is a cure-all. And Wilkinson is clear about the bigger picture: “In addition to the foods listed above, it’s also super important to stay hydrated, get enough sleep, though this isn’t always possible during the festive season.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, with a few fermented foods, a grating of ginger, a bowl of oats, a slice of papaya or an apple tucked into your bag, you can embrace the excess without feeling like your stomach is staging a mutiny. Christmas, after all, is meant to be enjoyed, not endured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 12:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPa3p3SjhoWHhrejFoUE9VOFNfUXh4UmdSR19zdzVrYTNhamlMRUNLMHJBZWVJcmJTU3lMTlIxT1JOYW1WOGg1R0JRMGk5SWNYekZvS3BSb2l1RE5FS3hIcWh1MXNxNE8zOExSLVRHQjhWLU1Gd2xCQ2dxVEFhOW02RjdzU1hvNDhUWlVOd210UUR4Vm9OQ004N0tIdVhBVFRURTg2U0Jta052Sm11OGN1VTVVSWhaYTd0bEItOF9TQWVSdTdrbG5r</guid></item><item><title>Home Alone的“湿土匪”是医学奇迹！医生揭示了凯文的诱杀陷阱如何在现实世界中被证明是致命的-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15398919/Home-medical-miracles-doctor-booby-traps.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Home Alone's villainous burglars are truly on-screen &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/christmas/index.html" id="mol-95f50eb0-dcd7-11f0-b8c0-5d27f4c7964b"&gt;Christmas&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In this scene from the first Home Alone film, Harry (Joe Pesci) is set alight with a flamethrower - a stunt that in real life caused the actor 'serious burns'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Piercing injuries also feature heavily such as a nail through the foot, which can damage nerves and soft tissues, fracture bones, and introduce bacteria deep into the wound, raising the risk of serious infection, including tetanus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the two films, the villains are electrocuted, crushed by a shelf of paints, thrown onto the roof of a car, and burned on a scalding hot doorknob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They're also ambushed with metal tools, fired at with stapes at close range, and set alight with a flamethrower (which &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tvshowbiz/article-11484073/Joe-Pesci-revealed-suffered-burns-fire-hat-prank-Home-2.html"&gt;caused Pesci serious burns&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps most shockingly, in the second film Marv is hit in the face four times with bricks thrown by Kevin from the roof of a building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of being knocked out cold, Marv writhes on the ground like a snake and emits a series of high-pitched squeaks before eventually getting to his feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Professor Taylor, such assaults 'involve levels of force that would be catastrophic in real life' and 'are not things a human body can simply shrug off'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The academic takes one booby trap as an example – where Marv gets hit in the head by a 100lb (45kg) bag of cement connected to a rope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A rough calculation of the forces involved when a 100lb bag of cement strikes the head suggests instant fatal injury,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The neck simply cannot absorb that level of force.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Arguably, the pain inflicted on the villains in the second film 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' are even more sadistic than the original, such as electrocution (pictured)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Arguably, the pain inflicted on the duo in the second film 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York' are even more sadistic than the original film – such as electrocution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Marv grabs taps attached to an arc welder, he is exposed to electrical current that causes his muscles to contract uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Again, the fact we see his skeleton is a cartoon-inspired touch that's not based in reality (electricity does not make the skeleton visible as there is no X-ray radiation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, surviving Kevin's festive booby traps would require 'extraordinary luck, immediate trauma care, and months of rehabilitation', according to Professor Taylor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Perhaps those lingering injuries explain why the Wet Bandits never made it back for another sequel,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox sciencetech" data-version="2" id="mol-62c5fe20-dccb-11f0-b8c0-5d27f4c7964b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-15398919/Home-medical-miracles-doctor-booby-traps.html"&gt;

Whether you are swarmed with countless ‘what-ifs’ or feeling constantly fidgety, anxiety can feel overstimulating, leaving you exhausted. This heightened mental state, however, also affects your body. Aarushi Kohli, a mental health and rehabilitation therapist, shared with HT Lifestyle that anxiety rewires your physiology, suggesting how powerful it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anxiety does not stay as a mental issue, as she stated, "&lt;span&gt;We often think of anxiety as something that happens only in the mind, like the overthinking, the worry, the constant feeling of being on edge. But anxiety is also deeply physical.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the persistent sense of uneasiness or dread soon manifests physically as well, through racing heart, shallow breathing and muscle tension. Your nervous system reacts, and as the therapist noted, struggles to differentiate between actual danger and emotional or imagined threats. This means issues like social judgment, rejection, and failure can all elicit the same physical responses, just like when one is confronted with actual tangible danger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How does anxiety affect your health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/11/550x309/insomnia_1749640606473_1749640613102.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Anxiety may affect your sleep quality too!(Shutterstock)" title="Anxiety may affect your sleep quality too!(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Anxiety may affect your sleep quality too!(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anxiety is not just a mental state; you face very real, physical consequences. The therapist elaborated,“&lt;span&gt;Stress hormones like cortisol stay high, sleep becomes light, digestion slows, and energy drops. Over time, the body begins to expect this tension, as if being alert all the time is the only way to stay safe. That’s how anxiety gradually rewires physiology: the nervous system learns to treat calm as unfamiliar and vigilance as normal."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;This means when you are anxious all the time, your nervous system also adapts to this constant tension, causing you to worry even when there is no real tension. With this persistent worry, major physical symptoms also follow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to manage anxiety?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapist Aarushi sharedthese 8 expert tips that mayhelp manage anxiety:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Pause and notice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check in with your body- your breath, posture, or any tension. Awareness is the first step to calm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Slow your breath&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Breathe out a little longer than you breathe in. It gently tells your body,‘&lt;/span&gt;You’re safe.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Move gently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stretch, walk, or practice slow yoga. Movement helps release the stress your body holds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Create small safety rituals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sip tea slowly, sit by a window, or listen to music. Tiny moments of ease retrain the body to relax.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Name what you feel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Say to yourself,‘&lt;/span&gt;Something in me feels anxious right now.’&lt;span&gt; Noticing without judging builds inner safety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Rest before you crash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pause for short breaks instead of waiting till you’re exhausted. Your body learns it can rest without guilt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Reach for connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share how you feel with someone you trust. Feeling seen helps your body settle and feel less alone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Reach out to a professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If how you are feeling is coming in the way of building a life that you envision for yourself, seek help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;A fitness expert breaks down the best standing moves to fire up your lower belly and burn fat.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Is a flat belly on your fitness bucket list? If so, you’ve come to the right place. This area of the body is a common spot to accumulate extra fat—and although it’s easy to put on, it can be challenging to lose. We spoke with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://linkedin.com/in/chad-lipka-54297096" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chad Lipka&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fitness expert and president of North Shore Sauna, who shares five standing moves that flatten &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-flatten-lower-belly-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;lower belly fat&lt;/a&gt; quicker than floor exercises after 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-standing-exercises-strengthen-back-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;Standing exercises&lt;/a&gt; work quite effectively, as they fire up your core, along with several major muscle groups at the same time. You’ll burn calories, speed up your metabolism, and eliminate unwanted fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you work your core in a standing position, as compared to on the floor, your lower belly gets fired up in a distinct way because you have to stabilize your entire kinetic chain (from foot to pelvis) while controlling movement against gravity,” Lipka tells us. “After 50, the lower belly can sag and become more resistant to shift due to hormonal changes, reduced muscle activation in what’s called the transverse abdominis and years of sitting that tighten hip flexors and ‘switch off’ deep core support. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-moves-strength-shrink-waist/" target="_blank"&gt;Standing resistance moves&lt;/a&gt; counteract this by challenging the core in a way that mimics how it is used in everyday life: to stabilize while you move.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, Lipka reveals his favorite standing exercises to help reduce lower belly fat after 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin standing tall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach your left arm overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive your right knee up toward your elbow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel the stretch and contraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, reach your right arm overhead and drive your left knee up toward your elbow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete 3 sets of 12 reps on each side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin standing tall with your feet hip-width apart and arms relaxed at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core by rounding your upper back gently and tucking your ribs in toward your pelvis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your left knee to hip level while maintaining the rounded position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the knee lift for 3 seconds, keeping your shoulders relaxed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side, lifting your right knee to hip level and holding the lift for 3 seconds before lowering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 20 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In mice, limited intakes of one specific essential amino acid can slow the effects of aging and even extend their lifespan, research from the US shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists wonder if these findings could help people improve their longevity and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoleucine"&gt;Isoleucine&lt;/a&gt; is one of three branched-chain amino acids that our bodies use to make proteins. It's essential for our survival, but our cells can't produce it from scratch, so we have to get it from sources like eggs, dairy, soy protein, and meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-critical-factor-predicts-longevity-better-than-diet-or-exercise-study-says"&gt;One Critical Factor Predicts Longevity Better Than Diet or Exercise, Study Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-aging-cocktail-extends-mouse-lifespan-by-about-30-percent"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;But there can always be too much of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00166-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413121001662%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Earlier research&lt;/a&gt; from a 2016-2017 survey of Wisconsin residents showed that the amount of dietary isoleucine was connected to metabolic health, and people with higher BMIs tended to eat much more of this amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the most recent study, a genetically diverse group of mice was fed either a diet containing 20 common amino acids as a control, a diet where all amino acids were reduced by about two-thirds, or a diet where only isoleucine was reduced by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice were around six months old at the start of the study, which is the equivalent age of a 30-year-old person. They could eat as much as they wanted, but only from the specific kind of food provided to their group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We like to say a calorie is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just a calorie," endocrinologist Dudley Lamming from the University of Wisconsin, who was involved in both studies, &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 when the newest findings were published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie, and we've been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146146" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146146" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642.jpg" alt="Various soy foods" class="size-full wp-image-146146" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/SoyFoods642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146146" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Our cells can't produce isoleucine from scratch – we have to get it from foods such as soy protein.

But rather than gaining weight, they actually burned more energy and maintained leaner body weights, even though their activity levels were no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very quickly, we saw the mice on the reduced isoleucine diet lose adiposity – their bodies got leaner, they lost fat," &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Lamming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think restricting isoleucine in humans, either by diet or pharmaceutical means, has the potential to yield similar anti-aging effects - although, as with all mice studies, we won't know for sure until it's actually tested in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/psilocybin-extends-life-of-human-cells-by-50-in-wild-new-study"&gt;Psilocybin Extends Life of Human Cells by 50% in Wild New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is easier said than done. Although the food provided to the mice was controlled, the researchers noted that diet is an incredibly complex chemical reaction, and there may be other dietary components involved in producing these results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restricting protein intake in general, for instance, has detrimental effects on the body, mouse or human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translating this research for real-world human use is more complicated than just reducing intake of high-protein foods, even though this is the simplest way to limit isoleucine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be that by choosing healthier foods and healthier eating in general, we might be able to lower isoleucine enough to make a difference," Lamming &lt;a href="https://news.wisc.edu/mice-eating-less-of-specific-amino-acid-overrepresented-in-diet-of-obese-people-live-longer-healthier/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_112585" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg" alt="Graphical abstract shows dietary isoleucine was restricted by 67%, charts showing blood glucose and body weight declining over time / age respectively, reduced frailty and cancer, increased lifespan (survival improved by 33 percent)" class="wp-image-112585 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg.jpg 996w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-642x642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/11/fx1_lrg-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-112585" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A visual summary of the impact the reduced isoleucine diet had on mice in the study.

Cases will remain elevated and even increase again for a week or two after Christmas and New Year’s and start to slow down as we reach the end of January, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cases may not be as high as right after the holiday, flu season will linger well into the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Flu is on the rise in many parts of the country.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The flu comes on fast and can lead to serious consequences, but there are treatments available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other respiratory viruses may start off with a lingering tickle in your throat, the flu hits you fast and all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within one or two days of exposure, most patients are going to have fever, chills, coughs, body ache, they’re going to feel pretty lousy,” Shipley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids may have these symptoms plus some GI issues like diarrhea or vomiting. Some of the symptoms can look like COVID-19 or RSV or a cold, but it’s important to know what you have. At-home tests are available at pharmacies, or you can go to the doctor to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are anti-viral treatments available for flu (and COVID-19) for high-risk populations. These anti-viral medications work best if started early on in the course of your illness. “Get tested early so that if you do qualify for treatment, you can get the treatment, you’ll feel better faster, and you’ll make it less likely that you spread it to other people,” Shipley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms become concerning — difficulty breathing, chest pains, an ongoing fever — don’t hesitate to get medical attention. “Flu, in particular, we know can cause complications. [It] can turn into bacterial pneumonia, can cause people to become really ill ... there were 400,000 hospitalizations last year,” Shipley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/flu.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Tens of thousands" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69432a3ee4b0fd459eefc43c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/flu.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Tens of thousands&lt;/a&gt; of people die from the flu every year, too, and states including &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-influenza-pediatric-death-denver-health/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Colorado" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69432a3ee4b0fd459eefc43c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-influenza-pediatric-death-denver-health/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wxii12.com/article/north-carolina-first-child-flu-death-2025-season/69799778" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="North Carolina " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69432a3ee4b0fd459eefc43c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.wxii12.com/article/north-carolina-first-child-flu-death-2025-season/69799778" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;North Carolina &lt;/a&gt;have already reported pediatric flu deaths this flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain groups of people including folks over 65, children under 4, folks with certain medical conditions like asthma and heart disease and pregnant people, are all at higher risk of complications from flu, Shipley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several things you can do to protect yourself from the flu this winter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Flu is a respiratory pathogen, so just like what we learned during like the height of COVID-19, masking is a really great strategy for people,” said Marnik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true if you’ll be in crowded spaces like airports or trains. “Wearing a well-fitting N95 is a great way to protect yourself from getting sick,” Marnik said. It also helps protect those around you if you are coming down with flu (or another illness) and don’t know it yet, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then if you’re in a crowded situation, maybe you can’t mask for some reason, then thinking about ventilation — can you open a window? Can you put an air filter in? Can you be in a space that’s less crowded?” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also not too late to get your flu shot, which can protect you from severe consequences. “The current data shows that if you define vaccine effectiveness as preventing hospitalization in adults, the current vaccine is about 30 to 50% effective in preventing hospitalization, and in kids, it’s about 70 to 75% effective,” Shipley said. “So, that’s pretty good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand washing is also an important way to prevent getting sick. It’s also a good idea to disinfect high-touch surfaces (doorknobs, cell phones, remote controls, etc.) with an alcohol-based sanitizer. Getting enough sleep and sticking to your exercise regimen can also help you fight off illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But because it’s an airborne pathogen, we really are thinking about what we’re breathing as being the primary way we could potentially get infected,” Marnik noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“Last year was one of the worst flu seasons on record for pediatric deaths, and there's some concern that this season could be as equally bad, if not worse than last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Elisabeth Marnik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This flu season is expected to be a bad one because of a mutation in the flu virus, which makes it more transmissible. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s doubly important to do all that you can to protect yourself and your loved ones from the flu this year, as it’s expected to be a pretty bad flu season (similar to last year).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year was one of the worst flu seasons on record for pediatric deaths, and there’s some concern that this season could be as equally bad, if not worse than last year,” Marnik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is because of a new mutation in the flu virus, which is behind the increased cases in other countries like Japan and the United Kingdom, and also here in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutated strain is known as H3N2 and “it’s changed a lot from prior versions of the flu,” said Marnik. “And when that happens, that means that our immune system doesn’t recognize it as well, so then more people are likely to get sick because they can’t fight it off as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know someone with the flu right now, they likely have this mutation. “It’s really this H3N2 strain that’s about 85-86% of our cases that we’re seeing now,” Shipley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the mutation, Varga said it “won’t surprise me at all when folks do the final debrief of the flu season to find that vaccine hesitancy was a big contribution to this — a little bit earlier, a little bit more severe, a little bit faster rise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, it’s not too late to get your flu shot and it can protect you from hospitalization and even death.

    &lt;p&gt;Six days after a senior FDA official sent a &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381196-prasad-email/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;sweeping internal email&lt;/a&gt; claiming that COVID vaccines had caused the deaths of "at least 10 children," &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/12-ex-fda-leaders-criticize-claims-made-by-agency-current-vaccine-chief-vinay-prasad/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;12 former FDA commissioners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; released an &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2517497" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;extraordinary warning&lt;/a&gt; in the Dec. 3 New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wrote that the claims and policy changes in &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/food-drug-administration-covid-19-vaccines-pediatric-deaths/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, pose "a threat to evidence-based vaccine policy and public health security" and break sharply from long-standing scientific norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is unfolding inside the Food and Drug Administration is not a narrow dispute over COVID vaccines. It is an attempt, according to critics and vaccine scientists, to rewrite the rules governing the entire U.S. vaccine system — how risks are weighed, how benefits are proved, and how quickly lifesaving shots reach the public. Former agency leaders warn that if these changes take hold, the consequences could be lasting: fewer vaccines, slower updates, weakened public trust, and more preventable outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad made clear he sees the moment as corrective. "Never again will the US FDA commissioner have to himself find deaths in children for staff to identify it," he wrote, telling employees the agency's mission, and its "worldview," would change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's email reopened old arguments about COVID vaccines, using what is generally considered weak and misleading science in the peer-reviewed research community. He claimed that &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-tracy-beth-hoeg-controversy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;FDA staff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; had found "at least 10" deaths in children that happened "after and because of" COVID vaccination, using reports from the &lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VAERS system is notoriously crowdsourced, meaning anyone can contribute, and scientists say it serves only as a clearinghouse for reports. For example, a person could file a report saying that after getting a flu shot, their hair turned purple. Though that report would remain in the database until it was reviewed, it cannot prove the cause of medical events. But Prasad argued that the true number of deaths was likely higher because many cases go unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Substack, &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/scoop-fda-vaccine-chiefs-memo-cited" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Medicine&lt;/em&gt; reported Dec. 11&lt;/a&gt; that Prasad used incomplete information and that a Dec. 5 internal FDA memo set the pediatric death toll from COVID shots somewhere between zero and seven. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote, "The FDA's investigation into deaths caused by Covid vaccines is still ongoing and there's no final count yet of those deaths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad also accused the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of downplaying the risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in young men; criticized the agency for approving shots for teenagers; and suggested that school and workplace vaccine mandates may have "harmed more children than we saved," adding that "we do not know if we saved lives on balance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more than 2,100 American children&lt;/a&gt; died of COVID itself since the pandemic began, the CDC reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on his erroneous and misleading claims about COVID vaccines, Prasad proposed a major overhaul of how vaccines are approved. He said the FDA should stop relying on immune markers to establish the efficacy of shots, such as antibody levels, and instead require large placebo-controlled randomized trials that track hospitalizations and deaths before approving most new vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many immunologists and vaccine experts say it's unethical to test vaccines known to be effective against disease with a control group that would receive a placebo, exposing them to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a rock-solid principle in bioethics that it is unethical to test any drug or vaccine against a placebo if it is known to be safe and effective. The reason is that such placebo-controlled trials would effectively deny patients access to a vaccine that could prevent a dangerous infectious disease," said Dr. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad called the current flu vaccine system an "evidence-based catastrophe," questioned the approval of vaccines for pregnant women based on immune response alone, and raised concerns about giving multiple vaccines at once. He told staff to rewrite FDA guidelines to match his new "worldview" and said anyone who disagreed with his "core principles" should resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former FDA leaders expressed alarm in the NEJM article. They said Prasad is exploiting public frustration over the federal response to COVID to spark doubt about the entire childhood vaccine system, which could undo decades of success in protecting children from deadly diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is really different. And it's really dangerous. And people will be hurt, particularly by the vaccine decisions," former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in an interview. He also warned that Prasad's proposed policies — which he noted echo positions on vaccines held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist — could shake the entire vaccine market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal of RFK seems to be to make it impossible for vaccines to be available in the U.S.," he said. If the proposals advance, he added,"it won't be a viable business."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilliard pushed back sharply on those concerns, writing: "The American people deserve evidence-based science. Dr. Prasad's email lays out a philosophical framework that points us toward that higher standard. We will soon release documents laying out that framework and data confirming how the COVID vaccine resulted in children's deaths that previous leadership failed to properly investigate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For generations, the childhood vaccine program has depended on clear rules, strong safety systems, and public trust. Experts say Prasad's ideas, based on claims they argue are not supported by real evidence, could make it much harder to test, approve, and deliver vaccines to families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fueling parental doubt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's memo indicates he considers VAERS reports as proof that vaccines caused children's deaths. The system, though, is designed to be only an "&lt;a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;early warning system&lt;/a&gt;" for potential safety issues with vaccines that can be investigated further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"VAERS signals should never be taken as proof of true vaccine risks without careful, confirmatory studies," said Dr. Katherine Yih, an epidemiologist and longtime investigator with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing so, scientists say, directly feeds public fear at a time when many parents are already unsure whom to trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Causation requires converging evidence, not just one report or coincidence," said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's framework, however, treats uncertainty as a reason to halt development entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts fear this doubt won't stay limited to COVID vaccines. Once parents start to question the FDA's honesty, they may begin doubting long-standing vaccines for measles, polio, or whooping cough — shots that have protected children for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Science must be transparent," Gostin said. If families believe the FDA is misusing data or silencing experts, confidence in the entire vaccine system can collapse, he said. "There's a public narrative that people have lost trust in science, but that's not true. The vast majority want the FDA to make decisions based on the best scientific evidence. Once they believe that the agency is marginalizing scientists and cherry-picking evidence, their trust will plummet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Delicate vaccine pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prasad's new framework will likely make it far harder for companies to produce or update vaccines. The 12 former FDA commissioners warned that requiring clinical trials for all new or updated shots would slow vaccine improvements and leave people unprotected. His plan, they wrote, "would impede the ability to update vaccines in a timely fashion, especially for respiratory viruses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fast-changing viruses like flu and COVID, this could be disastrous. There's simply not enough time to run full clinical trials every time a virus mutates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also major business effects. Vaccine development is costly, and companies may decide the U.S. is no longer worth the risk. If companies slow down or leave the market, families could face shortages, fewer innovations, and fewer protections for their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising fear, falling standards, and under strain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Science depends on open and public debate. Prasad's memo warned his employees against it. In addition to demanding that FDA staff members who disagree with him resign, he said their disputes should stay private and called leaks "unethical" and "illegal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Ellenberg, a former director of the FDA's Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, warned that Prasad risks destroying the process that makes science credible. "If disagreement is treated as disloyalty, you lose the only mechanism that keeps science honest," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without strong internal debate, safety reviews become weaker. "You lose the checks and balances that make vaccine safety science credible," said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who served on the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network during the COVID pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But while the sugar may be removed, research increasingly shows that the body’s response to those sweet tastes, plus the caffeine and acids in diet sodas, may still trigger a range of physiological and metabolic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="HeadingThree_heading-three__PBHLs  __className_e10e47"&gt;Ten lesser-known issues associated with heavy diet soda consumption:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol class="NumberedList_numbered-list__oytz_" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="ordered-list"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt;Insulin response, appetite regulation &amp;amp; gut‐microbiome disruption &lt;/strong&gt;Artificial sweeteners may interfere with how the body senses hunger and fullness. Some research indicates they “stimulate the same neurons as the appetite hormone, leptin”, meaning regular use may raise the threshold for feeling full. Over time, this could lead to altered insulin, glucose responses and changes in gut-microbiota composition that affect metabolism and energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt;Weight gain and obesity risk despite “zero sugar” labels &lt;/strong&gt;Many users assume diet sodas are a free pass to weight control. But ZAVA says evidence suggests habitual use of ASBs can be linked with obesity, higher body-fat levels (including visceral fat), greater insulin resistance and a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes. In other words, the swap may not equal a win, habitual ASB (artificially sweetened beverage) use appears to correlate not just with body fat, but with clinically meaningful obesity risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt;Mental health issues, including depression &amp;amp; eating disorder links &lt;/strong&gt;Frequent consumption of sweetened beverages, including diet drinks, has been associated with higher depression risk among older adults, particularly women, according to ZAVA. Among people with eating disorders (for example, bulimia nervosa), higher diet-drink consumption has been observed: one sample found 34% of diet-soda drinkers reported higher levels of eating/shape/weight concerns versus 22% of regular-soda drinkers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt;Pregnancy and child neurodevelopment concerns &lt;/strong&gt;Emerging data suggest that when expectant mothers consume ASBs regularly, children may show lower cognitive scores, indicating possible detrimental effects on neurodevelopment, compared with mothers who consumed little or none, according to ZAVA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-700e1ff3-0 VljCu"&gt;&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt;Gut health &amp;amp; metabolic imbalance &lt;/strong&gt;Additives in diet sodas (sweeteners, acidifiers, and emulsifiers) may alter the microbiome’s composition and fibre metabolism activity.

Given its large R&amp;amp;D budget, it was natural to use Pfizer as a barometer of the pharmaceutical industry, which was in the midst of a productivity slump. In the 1990s, the Food and Drug Administration approved a total of 311 new medicines. However, despite far greater investments in R&amp;amp;D, the industry received only 235 approvals over &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/histories-fda-regulated-products/summary-nda-approvals-receipts-1938-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the next decade.&lt;/a&gt; At the time, industry skeptics felt this was the new norm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, I had a different view. In the 2000s, the industry was undergoing a major transformation. Based on the remarkable advances being made in the understanding of the causes of diseases thanks to the unraveling of the human genome, along with the appreciation of the potential of drugs outside of small molecules like antibodies and therapeutic vaccines, it was apparent that the pharmaceutical industry was on the cusp of a productivity surge. We were on the verge of a new age in drug discovery that would make big advances in treating cancer, diabetes, and other debilitating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I suspect that Berenson felt I was a bit naïve in my views. He (or his editors) titled his article “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/a-pfizer-scientist-sees-research-dividends-ahead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Optimistic&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/a-pfizer-scientist-sees-research-dividends-ahead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; A Pfizer Scientist Sees Research Dividends Ahead&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem have discovered a tiny RNA molecule that can potentially lead the way toward treatments against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called PreS, the molecule enables a bacteria-eating virus known as a bacteriophage — or phage, for short — to take control of a bacterial cell and use it for its own growth, eventually destroying the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious global health threats of our time,” Dr. Sahar Melamed, head of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem’s Melamed lab, told The Times of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Understanding how phages operate can “aid scientists in furthering research and therapies that might help fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer-reviewed study, led by PhD student Aviezer Silverman, MSc student Raneem Nashef, and computational biologist Reut Wasserman from the Hebrew University, in collaboration with Prof. Ido Golding’s group from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, appeared on Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2025.11.019"&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-article-startup newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="startupisrael" data-from="Newly discovered RNA molecule could lead to new treatments in war against ‘superbugs’"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;h3&gt;The global threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of antimicrobial resistance has become a global health challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the world, these bacteria that defy antibiotics — commonly known as “superbugs” — were directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early as 2013, a State Comptroller’s report found that some 5,000 Israelis were dying annually from infections associated with this bacterial resistance, and those numbers continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A French-Canadian microbiologist, Félix d’Hérelle, first discovered bacteriophages in 1917. He chose the name from the Ancient Greek phagein, to devour, or to eat bacteria. He found the bacteriophage that destroyed the bacteria that cause dysentery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once penicillin was discovered, most scientists stopped researching phages. As bacteria have become more resistant to antibiotics, researchers realized they needed more solutions and returned to phage research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Phage therapy research in Israel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need for a solution has become increasingly urgent as more bacteria become resistant to antibiotic treatment. Over the course of the two-year war in Gaza, dozens of IDF soldiers became infected with these superbugs. One soldier, &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/staff-sgt-res-hanan-drori-26-dies-of-fungal-infection-after-gaza-injury/"&gt;Hanan Drori&lt;/a&gt;, died from a severe fungal infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, the Israel Phage Therapy Center was established in partnership with Hadassah Medical Center, focusing on the therapeutic potential of phages that target and kill bacteria with precision, with numerous successful phage treatments against microbial infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the war began, the center’s researchers have named some of the phages that they discover in &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/researcher-names-potent-lifesaving-virus-after-soldier-boyfriend-killed-in-gaza-war/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; of people who were killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Listening to RNAs ‘talk’ to each other&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said the lab used RIL-seq (RNA Interaction by Ligation and sequencing), a method he developed during his post-doctorate studies in Prof. Hanah Margalit’s lab at Hebrew University.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3715225" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/Sahar-Melamed-Credit-Bruno-Charbit-e1766070544887.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-vertical wp-image-3715225" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/Sahar-Melamed-Credit-Bruno-Charbit-e1766070544887-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Prof. Sahar Melamed of Hebrew University’s Melamed Lab in the Faculty of Medicine. (Courtesy/Bruno Charbit)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist said that he invented a new application for RIL-seq in this current study to map interactions “while the bacteria are infected with the phage,” Melamed explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RIL-seq is a method that identifies interacting RNA molecules inside a cell by “gluing” them together and then sequencing the joined molecules to see which RNAs are paired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers could study how small RNAs “talked” to each other within the bacteria, uncovering “a new level of communication between bacteria and phages,” he said, mapping RNA interactions that were previously hard to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said they were surprised to discover the tiny RNA molecule PreS inside a lambda phage, which attacks E. coli bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Lambda] is one of the most studied viruses for the past 75 years,” he said, “but we found PreS, which no one had noticed before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PreS hijacks the bacterium’s replication machinery,” Melamed said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is then able to “reproduce efficiently inside individual bacteria,” he explained. “It also maximizes its spread through the bacterial population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an increasing number of phages are produced, they get so numerous that they burst out of the cell, killing the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncovering how PreS takes control of bacterial cells provides important basic knowledge that could help scientists design smarter, more effective phage treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melamed said his lab’s next study will focus on finding other RNA molecules in diverse phages, “to understand how they also manipulate bacterial systems and tailor them for their needs.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scientists are actively seeking alternative treatments for antimicrobial resistance,” Melamed said. “One particularly promising approach is phage therapy, which uses viruses that specifically infect and kill bacteria, offering a targeted and potentially powerful alternative to conventional antibiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that this research changes “how we think about the molecular dialogue between phages and their hosts, providing potential new routes for phage therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p data-start="78" data-end="308"&gt;A potentially deadly virus linked to mass die-offs of whales and dolphins worldwide has been detected in Arctic waters for the first time, raising new concerns about disease risks in a region undergoing rapid environmental change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="310" data-end="599"&gt;Scientists have confirmed the presence of cetacean morbillivirus above the Arctic Circle after collecting respiratory samples from wild whales in northern Norway using drones – a breakthrough that opens new possibilities for monitoring the health of marine mammals without disturbing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="601" data-end="964"&gt;The virus, which can cause severe respiratory, neurological and immune system damage in whales, dolphins and porpoises, has been responsible for multiple mass mortality events since it was first identified in 1987. Its detection in Arctic whale populations highlights the vulnerability of these ecosystems as species increasingly overlap in warming northern seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="966" data-end="1362"&gt;The findings come from an international study led by Nord University, with partners including King’s College London and The Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, published in &lt;em data-start="1146" data-end="1171"&gt;BMC Veterinary Research&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers used consumer drones fitted with sterile Petri dishes to hover briefly above whale blowholes, capturing droplets from their exhaled breath – or “blow” – for laboratory analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1364" data-end="1648"&gt;Co-author Professor Terry Dawson, Department of Geography, King’s College London, said:&lt;br data-start="1451" data-end="1454"&gt;“Drone blow sampling is a game-changer. It allows us to monitor pathogens in live whales without stress or harm, providing critical insights into diseases in rapidly changing Arctic ecosystems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1650" data-end="1888"&gt;Between 2016 and 2025, the team sampled humpback, sperm and fin whales across the Northeast Atlantic, including northern Norway, Iceland and Cape Verde. Blow samples were analysed alongside skin biopsies and, in one case, an organ sample.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, with this official approval, we can finally expect insurers to cover this necessary treatment for a wider population of women.” &lt;br&gt;— Susan Marie Pacana, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all medications, Addyi has known potential side effects, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dizziness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleepiness or insomnia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stomach or back pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiredness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruiz said it would be very helpful for the drug company to issue a simple handout of all the “do’s and don’ts” associated with Addyi. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve got to make it as least confusing for patients to use as possible, so a simple do’s and don’ts information sheet would be useful,” he detailed. “And that would be useful for providers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women who may not want to take medication, what other things can they do to help with a low libido? For perimenopausal and menopausal women, Hall said optimizing their declining and absent &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-are-hormones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;hormones&lt;/a&gt; is extremely effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over the 40 years of my work in this area, I commonly see women’s sexuality bloom into a renaissance of youthful passion,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One alternative: estradiol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323178" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Estradiol&lt;/a&gt; is extremely effective for this, with the estradiol patch and compounded cream being my top two choices. When &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/276013" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;testosterone&lt;/a&gt; is low and replaced to youthful levels, orgasms become more easily accessed and are stronger. It is not uncommon for women to tell me that their desire is completely gone and that they can’t even have an orgasm.” &lt;br&gt;— Prudence Hall, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also when &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/thyroid-gland-function" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;thyroid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stress-hormones" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;adrenal stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; are precisely optimized, energy is increased and depression recedes. Women report that their sexuality returns to youthful levels causing a resurgence of intimacy and contentment with themselves and their relationships,” Hall continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Scheduling’ sex may help&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruiz said that sometimes a low libido comes down to a lack of a female patient’s understanding of how their body functions sexually, and how to communicate it to her partner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spontaneous vs. responsive desire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In terms of the first stage of sexual activity, for men arousal is instantaneous. For women, [i]t’s a little bit more diffused and not as direct, so that arousal time may take 20 to 30 minutes.” &lt;br&gt;— G. Thomas Ruiz, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Scheduling time for intimacy where that is the primary goal, things like that are helpful. Common activities where they’re together with their partner. Foreplay may take all day — it’s not a crazy thing to think about. And of course a good relationship with your partner — if you don’t have a good relationship with your partner, there’s not going to be a sex drive,” Ruiz explained. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also will also encourage women to practice with self stimulation so that they understand how their body works and they communicate that to their partner,” he added. “And that actually works for menopausal women as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPeHo0N0RTdVRjZElvaTdvX3RCSTNnQlE2MzZqanJRSFZ6WG1FRGR0My0tMWpOaGxXM3ZsWW8zbFVESFdFZ2hZYjBTdUNhMjVIRmZPaVVNY19mb0NHb1RiN2FKeHh0V0trZzJoR0hKbGhQSnlPQmo1QjRqOVZvZ3NYWldqay1qYVdOenUxcHJra1FuU2tmU25wbFNaQkVSdnNWZF82YjgwNzVzY1RIQ0RlUlZ3</guid></item><item><title>小猪试图在椅子上跳跃是您本周会看到的最有趣的事情- PetHelpful</title><link>https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/tiny-pig-trying-to-jump-couch-funny-tiktok</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PetHelpful</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 03:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE43eThPdV9BbDJNWGNkblRNUXplM0hwOVZ6SndHMVJjSDhWZ0Y3RjBzY1hNZzVLRU5QVm1OcHhmLVNCeTdWRk1RbDZkR2V3dGtXZE5jbUw4MzJoZG10WEN0U3U3TlB6QmVVTTdNZ2w2aFZMSGVBWnBMTXktM1Npdk0</guid></item></channel></rss>
