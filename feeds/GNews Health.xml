Lindsey and I talk on the phone often and had already spoken three times that week.

Every child of a parent with Huntington’s — such as my two sisters and I — has a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AF77L5PNLVBFFPBDHC7XREV5OA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Unlike conditions where you may not get the disease even if you carry the gene, if you test positive for Huntington’s, you will almost certainly develop it at some point. At-risk people can find out whether they have the gene through a testing process that includes a blood draw and appointments with trained genetic counselors who are available to discuss the process and the results before and after the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YJ2HR3FXC5FIDPAZTG4ZKG2DI4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At 27, Lindsey decided to take this step.

After our mom found hidden foreclosure bills in the garage, our parents divorced.

We now knew there was a 50 percent chance that the illness that ruined his life would affect ours one day, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66A64SNQOBBURF7XLEXERZVIF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hdsa.org/what-is-hd/huntingtons-disease-symptoms/" target="_blank"&gt;Subtle symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, such as mood swings, irritability and difficulty multitasking, typically start showing up in a person’s 30s and 40s, according to the society. Motor symptoms, such as involuntary movements and an inability to talk or swallow, usually arise in a person’s 40s and 50s and worsen over 10 to 15 years, the organization says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AITPTSGOQNE7XMHI46OTXBNDIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Our dad spent the end of his 40s in assisted living before moving into a nursing home, where he declined over the next decade. First, he lost 30 pounds and would use a walker. Then, he lost another 40 pounds and had to be pushed around in a wheelchair. At 98 pounds and confined to bed, he died two days before his 58th birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="2C2MZPROG5GZVCNOPDT5YLU5PQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="2C2MZPROG5GZVCNOPDT5YLU5PQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The two perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EELNT62RLZD5ZFOMJC3CMJ24CM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As the manicurists started on our first coat, Lindsey talked about the struggles she faced not knowing her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DIN2URUBABEC5IMXG2W57ER3WQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She didn’t know whether she should go back to school for seven years if she was going to start getting sick in 10 years. She was pretty sure she wanted kids, but without knowing her diagnosis, she couldn’t make any decisions about that, either. She felt stuck and stressed, and the key to moving forward was learning whether she had the gene for Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OWBMIP3EKJDV5GLNDXKTSCKHSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She paused, hoping for a response or maybe just a flash or recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XKTKCUICKJGG3MK7MJYX4455YA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I feel like being at-risk only affects my life in a good way,” was all I could say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X36HJHFHENASNNT63KMDAEVTZQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I didn’t want kids, or to invest in a pricey academic career.

Being at-risk suited me. The 50 percent chance I had of getting sick gave me drive, ambition and a grateful presentness. The other 50 percent gave me hope for a long and happy future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HMRCZ73NMVAFHEX32ERAG73PXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I feel like it only affects my life negatively,” Lindsey replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWYPXSP5GVFUXHI44BY332TBA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I nodded. She didn’t need to clarify. I knew what she meant. I had my down days, where my 50 percent chance of a shorter life didn’t feel like an opportunity to be present and motivated, but an unfair burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z2WZIM6KDVERBONLA6ZL47NDCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Something as simple as dropping a glass of water could leave me shaking and in tears. “Is this a symptom?” I’d question between heavy breaths. “Or just a clumsy accident?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DIGOAECBBZFATESBADADOV3NZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Without a diagnosis, you can’t know for sure — and those mental gymnastics were not something Lindsey was willing to live with anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6L6TGEGE4ZDLHHKTH2YBPOWQME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Christmas came and went without specifics about when Lindsey would get her results.

We sat on our couches in our separate cities. She had a blanket over her legs and a giant wine glass in her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SVG2JVCWBJGLDO6NE4UP6OHFVM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I leaned in close to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PHS7JQLHKFFLPPNKSVCJYW26F4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I tested positive,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XOS3H7E7D5HMRKAUCJHTIWQ4YU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The next morning, I took the day off and met friends at a bar, where we sat mostly in silence. “Surreal” seemed to be our favorite word to describe our numb, dreamlike state. I spent a week in bed watching “Grey’s Anatomy,” but, after a while, my life went back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LQ4BNMG7DNF4VAHWZ3Z5LAXRZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For a year, I watched her bounce back and forth between dread and solace. She reached out to family members we had fallen out of touch with to hear stories about our dad before he was sick. She made dark, offhanded comments like, “Well, I might be dead by then,” or, “I won’t be around to see that, anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UDIW326CKRF4VEV3D6CAZMEDUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Other times, you could sense her relief at knowing. She had her partner, a longtime therapist and friends to lean on, and all of those big life decisions she had struggled to make seemed to come into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="2KN54M3SHZEPBNXLLO7OBO3LBE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="2KN54M3SHZEPBNXLLO7OBO3LBE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Clarity, changes and what the future holds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TZYDYD6J7RB5XP2BCCPHXEMADI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Two years since our conversation in the nail salon, knowing her Huntington’s disease fate seems to offer mostly clarity. She said she is learning to say no for what feels like the first time, and she and her fiancé are organizing a small wedding in Italy, courtesy of her retirement savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MFGBA63MXBEWHCAEVMGYRPXOUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Meanwhile, I’ve found myself slipping into the darker side of Lindsey’s diagnosis, slowly coming to terms with the new reality of my 50 percent chance.

The girl I stayed up with until 5 a.m. drinking wine on the bedroom floor of my first apartment may not be able to tell me that funny thing our mom did. Instead, we might end up having one-sided conversations as she struggles to string together words that I’ll have to pretend to understand, just like I pretended to understand our dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FK4ZLP5IL5FITC6OMJ2CIRFRHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The girl who told her class that Mary Poppins and Dorothy from “The Wizard of Oz” were the same person because her “big sister said so” might lose so much weight that we’ll have to poke holes in belts to keep her pants up.

                &lt;p&gt;The Rock loves it, Zac Efron invests in it, and Equinox gym members are signing up for it in droves. Function Health is the latest hot commodity for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-longevity-tricks-to-improve-diet-routine-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; seekers looking to optimize their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promise is simple: skip the waiting room at the doctor's office and head straight to the lab, for comprehensive medical testing that evaluates the health of key organs, like your &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/test-heart-health-simple-exercises-to-live-longer-cardiologist" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function also measures some things that "regular" doctors typically don't, like &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-elite-athletes-curb-water-intake-after-4pm-top-dietitian-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;electrolyte&lt;/a&gt; levels as well as the so-called "heavy metals" — lead, mercury — potentially poisonous substances that can sometimes lurk in our air, water, and food. It might even find cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see what all the big buzz was about with this $500 annual blood-and-pee testing service, so I tried it out. Disclaimer: I didn't have to pay for it, because Function Health gave out free trials to journalists as the company is still in beta testing mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, my Function results led me to seek out more advice from doctors than I usually would, to help me separate the signal from the noise in all the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6dc5fe0a-902f-43cc-b07f-efdc842f9024" data-toc-id="6dc5fe0a-902f-43cc-b07f-efdc842f9024"&gt;I freaked out about all the little cholesterol particles hiding out in my blood&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      My Function results flagged seven "out of range" tests, and three of those were related to heart health.

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The good news is that Function is not a huge time suck. It takes about 15 minutes to get the initial testing done and you can roll up to just about any Quest Diagnostics lab location nationwide (except in Hawaii and Rhode Island).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their tests measure over 90 different biomarkers in your blood and urine, including almost all the typical stuff you'd find in a doctor's office (except STD testing). Function performed roughly three times the number of tests I had done the last time I went to the doctor's office for routine bloodwork. There were more measurements related to hormones, key nutrients, my metabolism, and heart health. Function Health also measured my "&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;," a scientifically squishy indicator of health and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many tests being run, there's a good chance that something you measure when you do Function will come back abnormal. That doesn't always mean there's something wrong with you; sometimes your own "normal" doesn't fit neatly into a given reference range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Function is OK with having a few errant flags in the data, and encourages re-testing any out of range labs. Their ethos is the more information, the better. It's about creating a more detailed picture of your overall health, not making sure each test is perfect every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are "wanting to know more about their biology, and to be advocates for their own health," Dr. Mark Hyman, one of the founders of Function Health, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hyman, a longtime friend of US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., chalks it up "to disillusionment with healthcare in general" in the US. Hyman says many people who use Function's tests may be able to resolve their own health concerns without ever seeing a doctor afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While you'll need to see a doctor for certain things, the beauty of Function is you come in, follow up, order follow up tests on yourself, and then you can follow the guidance," Hyman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His venture dovetails with the rise of new tech promising to put you in the driver's seat of your own health. Think wearables (&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oura-ring-fitness-tracker-pros-cons-after-years-wearing-style-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, watches, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/glucose-monitors-over-the-counter-track-blood-sugar-health-fitness-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;glucose monitors&lt;/a&gt;) and concierge medicine (full body MRIs, anti-aging &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nad-iv-therapy-we-tried-hollywood-secret-longevity-hack-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;IV drips&lt;/a&gt;). As the personalized medicine industry booms, Function is taking off. The company says its membership has more than doubled since December, to more than 200,000 customers.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;h2 id="90d2add0-2e39-4fd9-8e79-7f9136d93ed1" data-toc-id="90d2add0-2e39-4fd9-8e79-7f9136d93ed1"&gt;I ended up overanalyzing my results, and coming to some pretty silly conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first "out of range" marker that was mentioned in my Function report was a cholesterol measurement. While my regular LDL, or "bad" cholesterol number — the one you'd get measured in a doctor's office — looked fine, Function also measured the size of my LDL cholesterol particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, I had slightly elevated numbers of small and medium sized LDL cholesterol particles, which are more dangerous than larger LDL particles. This "could indicate an increased risk for cardiovascular disease despite normal LDL cholesterol levels," my results said, adding "it is vital to address the out-of-range results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a surprise. I had always been told I have "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started imagining all those tiny, sticky cholesterol particles racing towards my aging heart. Knowing how important &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heart-healthy-habits-reverse-biological-age-study-2023-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart health is for healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, and that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US, I started to worry. Should I quit my beloved mayonnaise? Maybe I should at least cut back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my initial shock, I reached out to independent cardiologists and longevity doctors for this story. I also spoke directly to Hyman about my results. All of those physicians refocused my attention, helping me interpret the results, and zoom in on the more meaningful ways to adjust my lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frankly, they reminded me why this kind of testing isn't widely recommended, and why we go to the doctor in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="e98fa65b-9a2a-42c9-98de-72b2656c9dd1" data-toc-id="e98fa65b-9a2a-42c9-98de-72b2656c9dd1"&gt;Without help from doctors, I was stressing about the wrong things in my labs and on my plate&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Function recommended five supplements for me: vitamin D, omega-3, CoQ10, berberine, and fiber.

              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even for me, a seasoned health journalist who isn't generally freaked out by medical test results, this felt like a lot to take in. In addition to the supposedly off-balance cholesterol numbers, there was also low vitamin D, and a few other items that could impact everything from my immunity to metabolism and fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a doctor's advice, I found it was easy to get lost in the noise of all the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think if you showed any cardiologist or lipidologist your panel, they wouldn't be worrying about you," Dr. Ken Feingold, an emeritus professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who is an expert on lipids and lipoprotein metabolism, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cholesterol numbers that really matter were fine, including the basics (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL) but also some of the more niche measurements that doctors are now factoring into clinical decision-making, like lipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B (APOB), Feingold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it would be very unfair to expect a consumer, the person that had the lab work done to try and figure it out on their own," Dr. David Sabgir, a cardiologist in Ohio who is also not involved with Function Health, told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, Function is designed to help consumers make simple nutrition tweaks they hadn't thought to make — perhaps adding fatty fish for omega-3, vitamin D, or fiber supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"80% of people's health issues will never need a doctor," Hyman said. "They're really lifestyle-driven and they can be modified through modifying your diet and your lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as a consumer, I found the barrage of information confusing, making it harder to feel in control of good decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, while Function gave me diet and supplement recommendations (vitamin D, fiber, berberine, omega-3, and coQ10, along with more fish and eggs), it buried the most important piece of nutrition advice that every doctor I spoke to was quickly able to point out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2d701cd4-7837-4216-87ac-d73dbbadc187" data-toc-id="2d701cd4-7837-4216-87ac-d73dbbadc187"&gt;Doctors told me to cut back on white bread and enjoy avocados&lt;/h2&gt;

                      Doctors recommended replacing white bread with whole grains, and enjoying healthy fats like avocados.

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a follow-up interview with Hyman — which is not standard procedure for Function patients — he told me I could improve my particle numbers by cutting down on, or ideally eliminating, refined starches and sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was advice that was not highlighted in my Function dashboard, but other doctors wholeheartedly agreed. It was the first thing they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miora longevity clinic director Dr. Gregory Pippert uses advanced blood testing that's similar to Function's, often catering to patients who are trying to optimize their health and gains in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I look at so much green on that," he said of my cholesterol panel. "Then I see particle numbers that are not massively high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pippert, the headline was simple: just skip the refined grains more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do I really, really need the big extra thick slice of white bread? Maybe not," Pippert said. "It's making the good choices more than the bad choices, but not obsessing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeing more granular data may help some patients take general pieces of health advice — to hit the gym five days a week, incorporate more strength training, or adhere to heart healthy diets, like the Mediterranean diet, more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The anxiety associated with the results may trigger more compliance with lifestyle modification," Sabgir said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can we be sure we'll pick out the right tweaks on our own? If I'm skipping mayo but not switching to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/whole-grain-bigger-meals-provide-more-energy-dietitian-advice-2022-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; or cutting back on sugar, I'm probably not going to have a huge impact on my test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know why people are offering this," Feingold said. "It's a way to make a lot of money because sure, they're charging a significant amount of money for this, but you don't really need it to make decisions about who you're going to treat, most of the time."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our bodies are unique and how often we poop varies from person to person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptoms such as bloating or hard stools may indicate that you are not going to the bathroom frequently enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staying hydrated, exercising regularly, getting enough fiber and stressing less can help you stay regular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, most people probably assume that pooping every day is the goal. However, experts agree that you can have a healthy gut and not poop every day. Since every body is a little different, not everyone goes No. 2 with the same frequency. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s not bad if you don’t poop everyday, because we all have a different version of normal. If we think of pooping like taking out the trash, then you want to be sure that you’re doing it regularly. So while you may not poop every day, it’s important that there is regularity,” says &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve ever been worried that you aren’t pooping every day, read on to find out why not pooping daily may not be such a bad thing and how to recognize when it may be a problem. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-is-it-bad-if-you-dont-poop-every-day"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Is It Bad If You Don’t Poop Every Day? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No, you don’t have to poop every day and your gut can still be in tip-top shape. “Bowel habits are variable within the general population. Suppose a person has between three bowel movements per week and three per day, with soft, formed stools and minimal defecatory symptoms. In that case, this is considered within the range of normal bowel patterns,” says &lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; Shukla goes on to add that there are no negative physiological consequences for otherwise healthy people if you aren’t going No. 2 daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So why is there so much variability when it comes to “normal” bowel habits? Several factors influence how frequently a person poops, including diet, hydration, stress, certain medications and activity levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-happens-inside-your-body"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Happens Inside Your Body? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The moment we take a bite of food or a sip of a beverage, our digestive system begins breaking down the food into essential nutrients. So while you may not go No. 2 every day, there is plenty happening in your gut behind the scenes. As waste is formed, it collects in the colon until your body signals that it’s time to head to the bathroom. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you aren’t pooping regularly, you may start to notice some uncomfortable symptoms. First, there’s gas and bloating. &lt;a href="https://wholeisticliving.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jenna Volpe, RDN, LD, CLT&lt;/a&gt;, shares that when stool remains in the intestines, it can ferment, leading to increased gas or bloating.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that the composition of your gut microbiome may play a role; individuals prone to constipation often have different strains of bacteria present in their gut microbiome compared to healthy individuals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to the potential for gas and bloating, you may experience dry and hard stools. “When you aren’t pooping regularly you will be more prone to dry, hard stools. This can mean that when you do poop you may notice that you’re struggling a bit, which puts more pressure on your pelvic floor and can lead to developing hemorrhoids and/or anal fissures,” says Sauceda.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, if pooping is our body’s natural means of eliminating waste, does skipping a day or two allow it to become toxic? While this is a popular selling point for colon cleanses, there isn’t scientific evidence to back up the theory that your poop can poison your body if you aren’t pooping daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your microbiome, which is a key player in your immune system, is well-equipped to protect you. In fact, colon cleanses may sweep away the good gut bacteria you need to support healthy bowel habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-skipping-poops-does-become-a-problem"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When Skipping Poops Does Become a Problem &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While “regular” can mean something slightly different for everyone, healthy bowel movements should meet these criteria: “A healthy, normal consistency (but not too hard), brown in color and about 6 to 12 inches long and 1 to 2 inches in diameter (resembling a sausage or a peeled banana),” says Volpe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, skipping a poop becomes a problem if it has been longer than three days and you are starting to feel uncomfortable. The most common symptoms indicating that you’re not pooping often enough include bloating, excess gas and stools that are hard, dry or difficult to pass. Fortunately, you can address a sluggish digestive system with a few small changes to your diet or lifestyle.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you aren’t pooping regularly, here are a few tips from our experts that can help you get things moving again. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate:&lt;/strong&gt; “We all know to eat more fiber, but don’t discount water. While fiber is critical to get things moving, we have to help it along by staying hydrated. If you aren’t drinking enough water, then you can make constipation worse,” says Sauceda.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Your Stress&lt;/strong&gt;: “Stress can also slow things down in the gut, so addressing the stress can help get things moving. There is a strong connection between the mind and the gut, so if your mind is stressed, that can translate to a stressed gut,” says Sauceda.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: “Incorporating fiber-rich foods (such as fresh fruit, veggies or functional foods like chia seeds and/or ground flaxseeds) into the diet can go a long way to help get things moving in most cases,” says Volpe. She adds that you’ll want to make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids when adding more fiber to your diet. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move Your Body:&lt;/strong&gt; “Movement and moderate exercise can also help to promote healthy gut motility and regular bowel movements,” says Volpe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It doesn’t have to be anything too extreme or intense—even 20 minutes of walking each day (or most days) can make a big difference in gut motility!” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplement When Needed: &lt;/strong&gt;If you have tried increasing your fiber and fluid intake as well as being more active, and you’re still feeling backed up, supplements may help. Shukla notes that magnesium or prune juice are good options for getting things moving again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-to-see-a-health-care-provider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When to See a Health Care Provider &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since everyone’s “normal” bowel habits are different, research has found it’s more important to look out for changes in your normal pooping schedule. For example, not going to the bathroom regularly for two weeks or longer is a strong indicator that you should follow up with your doctor.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The red flag symptoms or warning signs that may indicate a more serious underlying condition in a patient presenting with constipation include rectal bleeding, blood mixed in the stool, unexplained weight loss, iron-deficiency anemia, a sudden or significant change in bowel habits, a change in stool caliber and a strong family history of colorectal cancer. The presence of any of these features should prompt further evaluation, typically with colonoscopy, to exclude colorectal malignancy or other serious pathology,” says Shukla.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s a common misconception that you need to poop every day for optimal gut health. Everyone goes to the bathroom on a different schedule; the key is to recognize what’s normal for you and take note if you’re experiencing discomfort. Symptoms like bloating or hard stools are indicators that you aren’t going to the bathroom frequently enough, and it may be time to adjust your diet or activity to promote regular bowel movements.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks"&gt;issued an urgent warning&lt;/a&gt; about tianeptine – a substance marketed as a dietary supplement but known on the street as "gas station heroin".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;overdoses and deaths&lt;/a&gt;, it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7304a5.htm?s_cid=mm7304a5_w"&gt;being sold&lt;/a&gt; in petrol stations, smoke shops and online retailers, despite never being approved for medical use in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is tianeptine, and why is it causing alarm?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-issues-eye-drops-warning-after-deadly-outbreak-of-bacterial-infections?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA Issues Eye Drops Warning After Deadly Outbreak of Bacterial Infections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40122-023-00539-5"&gt;Tianeptine&lt;/a&gt; was developed in France in the 1960s and approved for medical use in the late 1980s as a &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_J2ti4EkYpkC&amp;amp;pg=PA3222"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structurally, it resembles tricyclic antidepressants – an older class of antidepressant – but pharmacologically it behaves &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4119213/"&gt;very differently&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike conventional antidepressants, which typically increase serotonin levels, tianeptine appears to act on the brain's glutamate system, which is involved in learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is used as a prescription drug in some European, Asian and Latin American countries under brand names &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11587517/"&gt;like Stablon or Coaxil&lt;/a&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25026323/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; later discovered something unusual, tianeptine also activates the brain's &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0225-3"&gt;mu-opioid receptors&lt;/a&gt;, the same receptors targeted by morphine and heroin – hence it's nickname "gas station heroin".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A box of Stablon pills." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=464&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/677034/original/file-20250627-56-dwbp50.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=583&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;As a prescription drug, tianeptine is sold under various brand names, including Stablon. (IllusionalFate/&lt;a class="source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26786285"&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At prescribed doses, the effect is subtle, but in large amounts, tianeptine can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;euphoria, sedation and eventually dependence&lt;/a&gt;. People chasing a high might take doses far beyond anything recommended in medical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite never being approved by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-select-dietary-supplement-ingredients-and-other-substances/tianeptine-dietary-supplements"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;, the drug is sold in the US as a "wellness" product or nootropic – a substance supposedly used to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/tianeptine-is-safe-use-possible/art-20562252"&gt;enhance mood or mental clarity&lt;/a&gt;. It's packaged as capsules, powders or liquids, often misleadingly labelled as dietary supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This loophole has enabled companies to circumvent regulation. Products like Neptune's Fix have been promoted as safe and legal alternatives to traditional medications, despite lacking any clinical oversight and often containing unlisted or dangerous ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some samples have even been found to contain &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38300852/"&gt;synthetic cannabinoids and other drugs&lt;/a&gt;. According to US poison control data, calls related to tianeptine exposure rose by over &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39724478/"&gt;500% between 2018 and 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/tianeptine-products-linked-serious-harm-overdoses-death"&gt;In 2024 alone&lt;/a&gt;, the drug was involved in more than 300 poisoning cases. The FDA's latest advisory included product recalls and import warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users have taken to the social media site Reddit, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingTianeptine/"&gt;including a dedicated channel&lt;/a&gt;, and other forums to describe their experiences, both the highs and the grim withdrawals. Some report taking hundreds of pills a day. Others struggle to quit, describing cravings and relapses that mirror those seen with classic opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since tianeptine doesn't show up in standard toxicology screenings, health professionals &lt;a href="https://keystonelab.com/tianeptine/tianeptine-drug-testing-guidelines/"&gt;may not recognise it&lt;/a&gt;. According to doctors in North America, it could be present in hospital patients without being detected, particularly in cases involving &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/tianeptine-is-safe-use-possible/art-20562252"&gt;seizures or unusual heart symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People report experiencing withdrawal symptoms that resemble those of opioids, like &lt;a href="https://www.crew.scot/drug/fentanyl/"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6730a2.htm"&gt;anxiety, tremors, insomnia, diarrhoea and muscle pain&lt;/a&gt;. Some have been hospitalised due to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-consumers-not-purchase-or-use-any-tianeptine-product-due-serious-risks"&gt;seizures, loss of consciousness and respiratory depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UK legality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, tianeptine is not licensed for medical use by the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency"&gt;Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&lt;/a&gt; and it is not classified as a controlled substance under the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation"&gt;Misuse of Drugs Act 1971&lt;/a&gt;. That puts it in a legal grey area, not formally approved, but not illegal to possess either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be bought online from overseas vendors, and a quick search reveals dozens of sellers offering "research-grade" powder and capsules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little evidence that tianeptine is circulating widely in the UK; to date, just one confirmed sample has been publicly recorded in a national drug testing &lt;a href="https://www.wedinos.org/"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt;. It's not mentioned in recent Home Office or Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/controlled-drugs-list--2/list-of-most-commonly-encountered-drugs-currently-controlled-under-the-misuse-of-drugs-legislation"&gt;briefings&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not appear in official crime or hospital statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that may simply reflect the fact that no one is looking for it. Without testing protocols in place, it could be present, just unrecorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of its &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Tianeptine"&gt;chemical structure&lt;/a&gt; and unusual effects, if tianeptine did show up in a UK emergency department, it could easily be mistaken for a tricyclic antidepressant overdose, or even dismissed as recreational drug use. This makes it harder to diagnose and treat appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's possible, particularly among people seeking alternatives to harder-to-access opioids, or those looking for a legal high. With its low visibility, online availability and potential for addiction, tianeptine ticks many of the same boxes that once made drugs like &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/mcat-meow-meow-drug-2024-young-people-london-raves-b1185517.html"&gt;mephedrone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.crew.scot/drug/synthetic-cannabinoids/"&gt;spice&lt;/a&gt; popular before they were banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK has seen waves of novel psychoactive substances emerge through similar routes, first appearing online or in head shops, then spreading quietly until authorities &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-uk-has-banned-drugs-that-dont-even-exist-yet-psychoactive-substances-act/"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;. If tianeptine follows the same path, by the time it appears on the radar, harm may already be underway.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259194/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

While medications and lifestyle play a vital role, adding a single vegetable can naturally improve blood sugar control, even for those with diabetes. A new study found that eating a certain vegetable has been linked to improved blood sugar levels in prediabetes, a precursor to type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted at the University of Gothenburg found that a compound in broccoli has a more significant effect on blood sugar levels in certain people. The study is published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-01932-w" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Microbiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Broccoli’s role in managing blood sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, is an antidiabetic agent in type 2 diabetes. A study conducted in 2017 found reduced &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/diabetes-10-smart-fruit-choices-to-help-manage-blood-sugar-levels/photostory/122145614.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in people with diabetes after they took large doses of sulforaphane extracted from broccoli sprouts. The new study looked at the impact of this compound in controlling blood sugar in people with prediabetes. This condition is a precursor to type 2 diabetes, with slowly rising blood sugar levels due to impaired insulin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The study &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 89 people with elevated fasting blood sugar, a sign of prediabetes. They were all between 35 and 75 years old and were either overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly given either sulforaphane or a placebo for 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither they nor the researchers knew who got what. By the end, 74 people completed all stages of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Significant change in fasting blood sugar &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were striking. The participants, who consumed the sulforaphane compound had a higher average reduction in fasting blood sugar than those who didn’t. In some participants, the results were even more prominent. Certain participants had more benefits. The group with the greatest improvement after taking sulforaphane had early signs of mild age-related diabetes, a relatively low BMI in the context of the study, low insulin resistance, low incidence of fatty liver disease, and low insulin secretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Possible precision treatment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediabetes affects millions of people across the world, and there is no clear treatment structure currently in place. This is because the condition often remains undetected. Early detection increases the chances of not developing type 2 diabetes. Anders Rosengren stressed the importance of early and individualized interventions to prevent the disease. The treatment of prediabetes is currently lacking in many respects, but these new findings open the way for possible precision treatment using sulforaphane extracted from broccoli as a functional food. However, lifestyle factors remain the foundation of any treatment for prediabetes, including exercise, healthy eating, and weight loss. The results of the study also offer a general model of how pathophysiology and gut flora interact with and influence treatment responses. A model that could have broader implications," Anders Rosengren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Kheera for weight loss: 5 reasons to eat cucumber with every meal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwJBVV95cUxNOWpkM0p2dHAwMHJQem5aVE5zNHpqcFN5akhtZXowT1NWbkNjTDVlTUtiREhpekR5OHIzWGlqbFAyOHFlbFVSei1NY01hVW5rQXNjMnEyUDF0VnphTnBQTFRTd2ZsZWphbUxhQUlEdmhFZ1JNbkpLcE9QMDJ5VzdvVkU5VC10RXVRSmE1RTZsLTFqQjNMV1FiMTZtSGp0aWNteEpCNEkzdUVxS3c1WElJRFh1OWRVanp2M2lkU3BSRl9iekpJdE9XWDZBLVZKREJudXQwV0t2SW9uYnZXU3NEbmJiaC04ZV85VDRvNEstQkZOOG1hWXhBclBzN204SWZMOUt1X2tUdy1ZOE1ETV9V</guid></item><item><title>如果您在70岁后整晚都睡不着，请尝试从晚上的日常生活中剔除这6个偷偷摸摸的习惯- VegOut | If you can’t sleep through the night after 70, try cutting these 6 sneaky habits from your evening routine - VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOMGNYTmR4NktfN25rc1ZQN3JHZ2ZfLV9yNF8tNmp4Q2xXTVFoQ3ZQOC1xLWFQV1FxeVRPX1pmLXZ4M3pwTmFfR3JadVhMWUdUd0piaHN0SEFQMVNIYW91dklSOWZMUlpXaWJ4bG9CSDVpMFE4cGhPa2tueXFmOGlIMFpLVV9HYUJpOGZpUmpzS2VUVzExd0w0cWxKY3VkWHFoMzQ2NTBWRXprVkkwZFhRclZUejRMSGZmLW80TDVoRkVzbHJnNmxXWm5tQXJISVN6OVAwRksxb2o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="319" data-end="559"&gt;There’s something incredibly frustrating about being exhausted, crawling into bed, and then… staring at the ceiling for hours. Or waking up at 2:47 a.m. for the third night in a row and wondering if this is just how life is going to be now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="561" data-end="690"&gt;For many people over 70, getting through the night without interruption feels like a luxury. But it’s not necessarily inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="692" data-end="918"&gt;Yes, age brings changes to sleep cycles, hormone levels, and even how our bodies regulate temperature. But what we often forget? Some of our evening habits—seemingly harmless ones—might be the very things sabotaging our sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="920" data-end="971"&gt;Let’s talk about the six culprits I see most often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="978" data-end="1017"&gt;1. Falling asleep in front of the TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1019" data-end="1230"&gt;We’ve all done it—curled up with a good show after dinner and nodded off halfway through. In fact, it can feel like a comforting bedtime ritual. But there’s a reason sleep specialists strongly advise against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1232" data-end="1519"&gt;TVs (and phones and tablets) emit blue light, which interferes with melatonin, the hormone that regulates your internal clock. Even with your eyes half-closed, your brain is still registering those flickering lights and unpredictable sound spikes—keeping your mind in a semi-alert state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1521" data-end="1780"&gt;Not only that, but falling asleep on the couch often means your body doesn’t fully relax. Your head might be tilted at a weird angle. Your back unsupported. Your sleep shallow. Then, when you finally get up to go to bed, your body treats it like a full reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1782" data-end="2015"&gt;I used to tell myself it “didn’t count” if I just dozed for 20 minutes in the recliner. But I started tracking my sleep with a basic monitor, and sure enough—on TV nights, I had way more interruptions and grogginess the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2017" data-end="2232"&gt;So if TV is part of your routine, that’s fine. Just time it to end at least 30 minutes before bed. Use that final half hour for something lower stimulation—like listening to calm music or reading with soft lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2239" data-end="2285"&gt;2. Snacking too late—even if it’s “healthy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2287" data-end="2359"&gt;Let me be clear: this isn’t about strict food rules or late-night guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2361" data-end="2650"&gt;This is about your body’s digestive system still working overtime when the rest of you wants to power down. Late-night snacking—especially on things like dark chocolate, yogurt, trail mix, or even fruit—can spike blood sugar or trigger wakefulness just as your body is trying to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2652" data-end="2922"&gt;Here’s something many people don’t realize: digestion slightly raises your core temperature. And one of the signals your body relies on for sleep is a natural drop in temperature. So a late-night snack, even a small one, can throw off that signal and delay deeper sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2924" data-end="3146"&gt;As Dr. Shelby Harris, author of &lt;em data-start="2956" data-end="2998"&gt;The Women’s Guide to Overcoming Insomnia&lt;/em&gt;, has noted, “&lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/is-it-bad-to-sleep-right-after-eating-8419928?.com"&gt;Digestion can disrupt sleep&lt;/a&gt;, especially when you lie down too soon after eating. It’s best to finish eating 2–3 hours before bedtime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3148" data-end="3350"&gt;I once got into a habit of eating a banana with almond butter around 10 p.m. because I thought it was “healthy fuel.” Turns out, even that mild snack was enough to keep my sleep shallow and interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3352" data-end="3556"&gt;If you &lt;em data-start="3359" data-end="3363"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need a little something, keep it light and easy to digest. A warm herbal tea, a small piece of whole grain toast, or a slice of avocado can help settle you—without overstimulating your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3563" data-end="3616"&gt;3. Having that one extra glass of wine “to unwind”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3618" data-end="3765"&gt;Alcohol is a common go-to for relaxation, especially in the evening. And yes, it can make you feel drowsy at first. But sleep-wise? It’s deceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3767" data-end="4016"&gt;Alcohol messes with REM sleep—that stage where your brain does the emotional and memory processing. And it tends to wear off a few hours after you fall asleep, leading to &lt;em data-start="3938" data-end="3959"&gt;rebound wakefulness&lt;/em&gt;—which is that sudden 2 a.m. alertness you can’t explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4018" data-end="4177"&gt;The reason? As your body metabolizes the alcohol, your nervous system becomes more active again, causing light sleep, vivid dreams, or frequent bathroom trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4179" data-end="4341"&gt;Sleep doctor Michael Breus puts it bluntly: “Alcohol is the&lt;a href="https://www.sleep.com/sleep-health/tart-cherry-juice-benefits?.com"&gt; number one sleep aid in the world&lt;/a&gt;—and also one of the worst things you can do for your sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4343" data-end="4597"&gt;Instead of relying on that nightcap, try something that mimics the ritual but doesn’t interfere with your sleep: a warm cup of tart cherry juice (which contains melatonin), a magnesium-rich cocoa tea, or even just a mindful breathing practice before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4599" data-end="4712"&gt;And if you do have a glass of wine or cocktail with dinner, just keep it early—at least 3–4 hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4719" data-end="4755"&gt;4. Obsessively checking the clock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4757" data-end="4791"&gt;This one sneaks up on a lot of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4793" data-end="4987"&gt;You wake up in the middle of the night, glance at the clock, and suddenly you’re doing math. &lt;em data-start="4886" data-end="4987"&gt;It’s 2:46… okay, if I fall asleep in the next 20 minutes, I can still get 4 hours before the alarm…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4989" data-end="5076"&gt;Before you know it, you’re wide awake, irritated, and now anxious about &lt;em data-start="5061" data-end="5066"&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5078" data-end="5310"&gt;This is called &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/how-to-sleep-better-good-nights-sleep-lpw6vfskn?&amp;amp;region=global"&gt;sleep performance anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s something I see often in people who used to be “good sleepers” but find their patterns changing with age. The more we try to force sleep—or monitor it—the more elusive it becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5312" data-end="5481"&gt;As Dr. Guy Meadows explains, “Clock-watching increases anxiety, which is one of the main enemies of sleep. You begin to fear being awake, and that fear keeps you alert.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5483" data-end="5711"&gt;Try this instead: remove visual cues. Cover your bedside clock or turn your phone face-down. If you wake up, resist the urge to check the time. Remind yourself that rest—&lt;em data-start="5653" data-end="5679"&gt;even if not fully asleep&lt;/em&gt;—is still valuable to your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5713" data-end="5860"&gt;Some nights you’ll still wake up. That’s okay. But by not adding pressure, you’re giving your mind a chance to ease back into sleep more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5867" data-end="5912"&gt;5. Having heavy conversations after dinner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5914" data-end="6187"&gt;Evening might feel like the natural time to talk things through—especially if you live with someone and the house finally gets quiet. But your nervous system doesn’t know the difference between a stimulating debate and an emotional argument. Either way, it kicks into gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6189" data-end="6440"&gt;I’ve been there. One minute I’m catching up with a friend or my spouse about something that happened during the day. The next thing I know, we’re deep in a serious conversation about finances or health fears… and my brain is now buzzing with cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6442" data-end="6552"&gt;It doesn’t always feel stressful in the moment. But your body still registers those discussions as activating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6554" data-end="6687"&gt;And when you mix that with aging-related changes in cortisol regulation, it creates the perfect recipe for fragmented, anxious sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6689" data-end="6954"&gt;Not every serious conversation can be perfectly timed. But where you can, shift those talks to earlier in the day. Or write down what you want to say and revisit it in the morning. That way, your mind isn’t left chewing on unresolved stress as you try to drift off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6961" data-end="7003"&gt;6. Staying too sedentary during the day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7005" data-end="7076"&gt;This one surprised me when I first started digging into sleep research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7078" data-end="7219"&gt;We often think of sleep issues as something to fix &lt;em data-start="7129" data-end="7139"&gt;at night&lt;/em&gt;. But a key part of deep sleep comes from how we move—or don’t—during the &lt;em data-start="7213" data-end="7218"&gt;day&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7221" data-end="7463"&gt;If your body isn’t getting enough physical activity, it doesn’t build up sufficient &lt;em data-start="7305" data-end="7321"&gt;sleep pressure&lt;/em&gt; (that biological drive that helps you fall into deep rest). And when you do lie down, you may fall asleep lightly but struggle to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7465" data-end="7611"&gt;As the National Institute on Aging puts it, “Regular physical activity can help you &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/exercising-for-better-sleep?.com"&gt;fall asleep faster&lt;/a&gt;, stay asleep longer, and feel more rested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7613" data-end="7824"&gt;This doesn’t mean high-intensity exercise or exhausting routines. For many people over 70, things like gentle yoga, gardening, housework, tai chi, or even a couple of 10-minute walks a day can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7826" data-end="7993"&gt;I’ve seen people improve their sleep just by switching their morning routines to include 10 minutes of movement after breakfast. It’s about consistency, not intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7995" data-end="8131"&gt;Sleep loves rhythm. And when your body has a full, steady rhythm of movement during the day, it’s more likely to settle deeply at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8138" data-end="8155"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8157" data-end="8300"&gt;Sleep isn’t just about rest—it’s one of the most important levers we have for cognitive health, mood stability, and overall vitality as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8302" data-end="8534"&gt;So if you find yourself waking up often, lying awake for hours, or feeling groggy despite spending eight hours in bed—it may be time to zoom out and look at what’s happening in those two to three hours before you turn out the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8536" data-end="8745"&gt;Try cutting one habit at a time. Track what works. Maybe it’s the wine. Maybe it’s the 10 p.m. bowl of granola. Maybe it’s something you hadn’t even noticed—like the conversation you’re replaying in your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8747" data-end="8936"&gt;Sleep hygiene isn’t a one-size-fits-all formula. But most of us can get better sleep not by adding more, but by gently removing the habits that sneak in over time and chip away at our rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8938" data-end="9009" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;A peaceful night is possible. You just might have to make space for it.&lt;/p&gt;

On April 9, 2025 the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International Diabetes Federation&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that chronic undernutrition can seed a very different form of blood‑sugar trouble, giving the condition its own place in the global classification system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Malnutrition‑related diabetes has historically been vastly under‑diagnosed and poorly understood,” said Dr. Meredith Hawkins as the vote was announced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkins is an endocrinologist at &lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Albert Einstein College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; and founding director of the Global Diabetes Institute (&lt;a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/centers/global-health/global-diabetes-institute/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GDI&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-a-fifth-type-matters"&gt;Why a fifth type matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly one in nine adults worldwide now lives with some form of diabetes, and more than 250 million people remain unaware of their status, according to the 11th edition of the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/idf-diabetes-atlas-11th-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF Diabetes Atlas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most public campaigns focus on type 2 diabetes, yet an estimated 20 to 25 million lean adolescents and young adults in Asia and Africa carry the new diagnosis of type 5, a burden comparable in size to HIV infection in the same regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike type 2, type 5 takes hold where food is scarce, not plentiful. That reality undercuts a long‑standing public narrative that ties &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; exclusively to over‑nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For governments counting every healthcare dollar, a distinct label matters. Budgets follow labels, and without one, entire populations have slipped through screening and treatment programs designed for very different metabolic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is about equity, science, and saving lives,” said &lt;a href="https://idf.org/who-we-are/our-structure/board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Peter Schwarz&lt;/a&gt;, president of the IDF, summing up the stakes during the Bangkok congress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-hunger-leaves-a-lasting-mark"&gt;Early hunger leaves a lasting mark&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of animal work show that a low‑protein diet during gestation or adolescence stunts pancreatic growth and the formation of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10046343/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta cells&lt;/a&gt;, the tiny factories that make insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human epidemiology echoes that biology, linking low birth weight and recurring childhood malnutrition to impaired glucose control later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now group type 5 under &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/69/10/2086/16081/Subtypes-of-Type-2-Diabetes-Determined-From" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;severe insulin‑deficient diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, a label that captures the core defect: the pancreas never learned to keep up with sugar loads, even though the rest of the body remains sensitive to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In South India, investigators tracked adults whose body‑mass index averaged just 18.3 kg/m² yet whose blood sugar routinely soared; birth‑weight records, where available, pointed to under‑nutrition in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community nutrition programs are therefore viewed not only as anti‑hunger measures but also as long‑range &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sugary-drinks-linked-to-millions-of-diabetes-and-heart-disease-cases/"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health economists note a secondary benefit. Feed a girl properly before and during pregnancy, and her children may avoid the same metabolic trap, breaking an expensive inter‑generational cycle of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State‑of‑the‑art euglycemic clamp &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/45/6/1428/146920/An-Atypical-Form-of-Diabetes-Among-Individuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2022, confirmed that type 5 patients secrete dramatically less insulin than matched controls while showing normal or even heightened insulin sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same work found little &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24147-visceral-fat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; and modest liver fat, a stark contrast to type 2 profiles. In practical terms, these young adults do not carry the metabolic baggage that fuels insulin resistance in obesity‑driven diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.testing.com/tests/autoantibodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Autoantibody screens&lt;/a&gt; stay negative, ruling out the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5723426/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune‑mediated beta‑cell destruction&lt;/a&gt; that defines type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers therefore line up: glucose levels look dangerous, &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/c-peptide-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C‑peptide&lt;/a&gt; looks scant, but inflammatory markers typical of autoimmunity are absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the pancreas is small, many experts suspect that oral drugs that nudge the remaining beta cells may help more than high‑dose insulin injections, a strategy that could lower costs and reduce dangerous hypoglycemia in food‑insecure settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diabetes-type-causes-clinical-confusion"&gt;Diabetes type causes clinical confusion &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are still unsure how to treat these patients, who often don’t live for more than a year after diagnosis,” Dr. Hawkins warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger clinicians, trained on the obesity paradigm, may reach for large insulin doses that push already fragile patients into &lt;a href="https://karger.com/gel/article-abstract/86/4/535/358345/The-Etiologic-Factors-in-the-Causation-of?redirectedFrom=PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ulcerating hypoglycemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misclassification also skews surveillance data. When a thin teenager in rural Uganda shows up with elevated glucose but no &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/keto-diet-promotes-fat-loss-but-potentially-wrecks-your-health/"&gt;ketosis&lt;/a&gt;, the chart often reads “type 1,” obscuring the true epidemiology and directing precious insulin supplies away from those who need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 commentary in the &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/bjem/pages/currenttoc.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bangladesh Journal of Endocrinology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; emphasized the threat: standard insulin regimens carry “potentially fatal consequences” for type 5 patients who are mis‑typed as type 1, because even small dosing errors provoke sharp glucose crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple screening cues can help. A BMI below 19 kg/m² in the absence of autoantibodies should prompt consideration of type 5, especially when the history includes prolonged childhood hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-steps-for-care-of-diabetes-type-5"&gt;Steps for care of diabetes type 5&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after the Bangkok vote, the &lt;a href="https://idf.org/news/new-type-5-diabetes-working-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IDF&lt;/a&gt; launched a dedicated working group to write diagnostic criteria, compile treatment algorithms, and build an international patient registry by 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel, co‑chaired by Hawkins and &lt;a href="https://www.cmcendovellore.org/nihal-thomas-php/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Nihal Thoma&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href="https://www.cmch-vellore.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christian Medical College&lt;/a&gt; in Vellore, India, will test low‑dose insulin, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513225/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sulfonylureas&lt;/a&gt;, and structured nutrition programs in multi‑site trials. Results could reshape essential‑medicine lists in low‑income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health agencies are already modeling the economic impact. Analysts predict that shifting even half of misdiagnosed cases from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; vials to oral drugs could save tens of millions of dollars each year, funds that might be redirected to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fathers-have-a-surprising-influence-on-their-babys-birth-weight/"&gt;maternal nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates also press for the inclusion of pancreas‑focused imaging in major nutrition cohorts. Measuring organ size early could identify high‑risk children before glucose spirals out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are taking decisive steps to correct this,” said Schwarz, insisting that momentum will continue. Policies built on that momentum will decide whether type 5 becomes another silent killer or a preventable relic of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/bjem/fulltext/2025/05000/type_5_diabetes_mellitus__global_recognition_of_a.1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 22:11:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNbGJmakNMd2pDR1JobmtpTzdOWnp4d19nYkI3ekZQNmpDT2ZlREpJSkJnM1BycHNhVVBxZkNKWVZieXZ6aG5GdU1sWU5JdnlFQXN3b090QmtxZWFfSkN0d00zQ1BWVWhiZFhpeVFGdHlfUnBuRWJjYVl6bjVBOVhMS1hfckw0TllJQjhIZ3h2SGxSU2pBYzVZeUMzbGdVQV9FdWY3SW1Nclo2TWJWcDJwYkdFWXd3QWJzcURv</guid></item><item><title>神秘的麻风病原体在美洲潜伏了4000年- ScienceAlert | Mysterious Leprosy Pathogen Has Lurked in The Americas For 4,000 Years - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPZzIyTEVOb1lZOTVfNFo5MXBlTWFGcTJ4bzhwQWMxeHhITjM5NURRYk9XdThIdnBlMmRROUlmYmJLQ1FOZ3BlbFQ2YnllelFKemdGQ0psYTZSM0pZTlJOSVdidGNhX2VITVFMME9pdlVuRTZpNUY0TFE2TzF4Nm1SU19fUFJjRFFoRVBlb1FMdnk3VE1KZFB4My1oeFU1Wms?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy"&gt;leprosy&lt;/a&gt; was circulating in Chile some 4,000 years ago, meaning the disease arrived in the Americas much earlier than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on an analysis of ancient bones and teeth by researchers from institutions in Germany, Argentina, and Chile, and it challenges &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-021-01120-2"&gt;the conventional wisdom&lt;/a&gt; that leprosy was a disease introduced by European settlers from the 16th century onwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a comprehensive study of DNA fragments found in two human skeletons, the researchers were able to match the genetic material to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_lepromatosis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pathogen – the less common of two bacteria known to cause leprosy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were initially suspicious, since leprosy is regarded as a colonial-era disease, but more careful evaluation of the DNA revealed the pathogen to be of the lepromatosis form," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Darío Ramirez, from the National University of Córdoba in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-warn-leprosy-isnt-ancient-history-as-cases-surge-in-the-us?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Experts Warn Leprosy Isn't Ancient History as Cases Surge in The US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still learning about &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;, which has only recently been identified. Another bacteria, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the dominant strain behind leprosy, and its history and spread has been more clearly mapped to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's a scarcity of samples in the Americas, &lt;em&gt;M. leprae&lt;/em&gt; has been tracked back &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185966"&gt;for thousands of years&lt;/a&gt; across Eurasia, which is part of the reason why researchers have long thought it traveled from Europe across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166422" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166422" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull.jpg" alt="Leprosy skull" class="wp-image-166422 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/LeprosySkull-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166422" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers found tiny traces of bacteria in human remains.

This new find, pushing its arrival back millennia earlier, adds further evidence that we need to rethink the history of leprosy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ancient DNA has become a great tool that allows us to dig deeper into diseases that have had a long history in the Americas," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Kirsten Bos, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The advanced techniques now used to study ancient pathogen DNA allows us to look beyond the suspects and into other diseases that might not be expected from the context."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to pick apart this history of disease isn't easy. Indigenous American peoples would certainly have had afflictions of their own, but they would have also been hit hard by infections &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/2000-year-old-pottery-reveals-trade-networks-in-australia-long-before-colonization"&gt;imported by colonists&lt;/a&gt; – infections their bodies were poorly prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are confident that there's more to the story, in terms of both modern and ancient forms of the disease – especially in regards to &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;. Each archaeological dig and clinical test gives experts more genomes to work with, which then further helps our understanding of disease history, spread, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemics-seem-to-have-made-a-comeback-why-is-this-happening"&gt;and diversification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the skill needed by researchers is knowing what to look for, which is highlighted by this study – previous work in this area may have missed ancient markers of leprosy, simply because no one thought to look for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This disease was present in Chile as early as 4,000 years ago, and now that we know it was there, we can specifically look for it in other contexts," &lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/24966569/0626-evan-a-rare-form-of-leprosy-existed-in-the-americas-for-thousands-of-years-150495-x"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; anthropologist Rodrigo Nores, from the National University of Córdoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-025-02771-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis and even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By June 27, 10 attendees - all of whom had eaten the salad - had sought treatment at one of two hospitals in Fresno County (five patients at each hospital) for symptoms resembling those of botulism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-95436990-590f-11f0-9a09-150b0fdb8864"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the Fresno County Department of Public Health and California Department of Public Health launched an investigation to discover the cause of the widespread illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After days of lab testing, officials were ultimately able to discover that the uncooked nopales present in the salad - which had been left unrefrigerated in 100 degree Fahrenheit heat and served on both days - was contaminated with C botulinum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soon after, eight of the 10 patients were diagnosed with the condition - marking it as one of the largest documented foodborne outbreaks of the infection in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-94ed88c0-590c-11f0-9a09-150b0fdb8864" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight people were hospitalized in California after eating a homemade salad made of uncooked nopales that was contaminated with C botulinum - a deadly neurotoxin that can cause paralysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nopales, a popular food in traditional Mexican dishes also known as prickly pear cactus, has recently gained popularity in dishes as a healthy ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials confirmed that one of the eight patients had made the salad using fresh onions, fresh tomatoes and home-preserved nopales stored in reused commercial glass jars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC case report, the salad-maker had immersed empty jars into boiling water and then added chopped, uncooked nopales mixed with a small amount of salt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once stuffed to the brim, she sealed the jars with new metal lids and stored them for six weeks in an outdoor shed behind her house - a technique she said she had been practicing for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she was unaware that she had created the perfect breeding ground for C botulinum spores as they thrive in a low-oxygen, low-acid, canned environment with moderate to high moisture and temperatures between 38F and 113F to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Norma Sanchez, communicable disease specialist with Fresno County Department of Public Health, later said they identified the contaminated cactus after sifting through trash cans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spores of this bacteria &lt;span&gt;are often found on the surfaces of fruits and vegetables and in seafood and, in this case, rapidly grew on the surface of the uncooked and canned nopales. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All eight patients diagnosed with botulism had double vision, seven had a hoarse voice, six were experiencing dizziness and six also found it difficult to swallow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The eight patients with clinical botulism were the only attendees who ate the nopales salad; the 42-year-old woman, who experienced the most severe symptoms, ate this item at both events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Once stuffed to the brim, she sealed the jars with new metal lids and stored them for six weeks in an outdoor shed behind her house - a technique she had been practicing for years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight of the 10 patients were diagnosed with botulism caused by C botulinum - marking it as one of the largest documented foodborne outbreaks of the infection in California &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, all of the patients had to stay at the hospital for between two and 42 days - out of which six were admitted to an intensive care unit and two required invasive mechanical ventilation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC later confirmed in its case report that all the people diagnosed with botulism had survived and recovered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Botulism is a rare but serious infection caused by a bacterial toxin that attacks the nervous system and is mostly commonly a result of food or wound contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of botulism include difficulty swallowing, muscle weakness, double vision, drooping eyelids, blurry vision, slurred speech, difficulty breathing, and trouble moving the eyes, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases of foodborne botulism, these symptoms of typically begin 12 to 36 hours after the toxin enters the body depending on the level of exposure to the toxin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If left untreated, the infection can cause muscle weakness, paralysis and in certain cases, death. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who are paralyzed need to relearn how to walk, talk, and perform everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimates that there are just 25 cases of foodborne botulism in the US each year, making it rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About five percent of people who develop botulism die, according to the CDC. For others, it can cause lifelong disability and extreme physical therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Fresno health department is urging people to follow proper storing and cooking methods to lower their risk of botulism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Any food at risk of contamination should be heated up to 240–250F, and heated all the way through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Following a brief breathing exercise, participants in the study reported feeling less negative and less agitated when viewing unpleasant images. They also felt more capable of using mental strategies to intentionally change their emotional state, suggesting this simple technique can provide an immediate boost to emotional self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long understood that the ability to manage our emotions is a key component of mental well-being and coping with life’s challenges. When this ability is diminished, it is associated with a range of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. A complex, bidirectional relationship exists between stress and our capacity for emotional control. High levels of stress can impair our ability to regulate our feelings, and, conversely, poor emotional regulation can make us feel more stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This impairment happens through a specific biological pathway. When we experience stress, the body’s central stress response system, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, becomes activated and releases stress hormones like cortisol. These hormones can interfere with the brain’s higher-order thinking regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive functions like self-control and decision-making. This process effectively weakens the “top-down” control our thinking brain has over our more automatic emotional centers, making it harder to stay calm and rational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given this connection, the researchers reasoned that if they could find a way to quiet the body’s stress response, it might free up the mental resources needed for effective emotional regulation. One promising method for doing this is slow-paced breathing. Deliberate, slow breathing has been shown to activate the parasympathetic nervous system, the part of our nervous system responsible for the “rest and digest” response that calms the body down. It achieves this by increasing the activity of the vagus nerve, a major nerve that helps regulate heart rate and other internal functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists behind this study sought to bridge a few gaps in existing research. While many studies have explored mindfulness, they often involve long-term training or simply ask participants to focus on their breath without deliberately slowing it. This study wanted to see if a single, very short session of intentionally slow breathing could have an immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, previous research often measured how breathing changed a person’s baseline emotional state, but did not test if it improved their ability to actively use a specific mental strategy, such as cognitive reappraisal—the technique of changing how you think about a situation to alter how you feel about it. Finally, the researchers wanted to test emotional flexibility by not only asking participants to reduce their negative feelings but also to intensify them, a less-studied aspect of emotional control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the research team conducted an experiment with 13 undergraduate students from a college in New England, with an average age of about 21 years. The study used a “within-subjects” design, which means that every participant took part in both the experimental condition and the control condition, allowing for a direct comparison of their performance under each circumstance. The two sessions were held online via video conference and were separated by one to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order in which participants completed the conditions was mixed to prevent any ordering effects. In both sessions, participants engaged in a cognitive reappraisal task. They were shown a series of emotionally negative pictures (such as images of accidents or violence) and some neutral pictures. Before each image appeared, they received an audio instruction to either “enhance,” “suppress,” or “maintain” their emotional reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the “enhance” instruction, they were asked to use cognitive reappraisal to make their emotional response stronger, perhaps by imagining themselves or a loved one in the situation. For the “suppress” instruction, they were to use reappraisal to lessen their emotional response, for example, by thinking of the situation as fake or by focusing on a non-emotional detail. For “maintain,” they were told to simply view the image and let their feelings unfold naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key difference between the two sessions was the manipulation. In the control condition, participants moved directly to the picture task after a short break. In the slow-paced breathing condition, before starting the task, they were guided through a three-minute “box breathing” exercise. An on-screen animation instructed them to inhale for four seconds, hold their breath for three seconds, exhale for four seconds, and hold for another three seconds, repeating this cycle for the full three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After viewing each picture, participants provided several ratings. Using a tool called the Self Assessment Manikin, which uses simple figures to depict feelings, they rated the picture’s valence (how pleasant or unpleasant it made them feel on a 9-point scale) and its arousal (how calm or excited it made them feel on a 9-point scale). They also rated their own performance on a 4-point scale, indicating how successful they felt they were at following the instruction to enhance, suppress, or maintain their emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breathing exercise had a direct effect on the participants’ emotional state. When instructed to simply “maintain” their reaction to negative images, participants in the slow-paced breathing condition rated the pictures as less negative and felt  calmer (less aroused) compared to their ratings in the control condition. This shows that the breathing exercise on its own served as an emotional buffer, toning down the immediate impact of the unpleasant stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more interesting were the findings related to the active use of cognitive reappraisal. The most striking result came from the self-reported success ratings. In the control condition, without the breathing exercise, participants reported that they were significantly less successful at suppressing their negative emotions compared to enhancing or maintaining them. They felt they struggled to mentally distance themselves and reduce their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the slow-paced breathing condition, this struggle disappeared. Participants reported feeling equally successful at all three tasks: enhancing, maintaining, and suppressing their emotions. When directly comparing the two conditions, participants rated themselves as more successful at suppressing their emotional response to negative images after having completed the breathing exercise. This suggests that the breathing exercise subjectively improved their sense of control and their confidence in their ability to manage their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the breathing exercise helped individuals who are naturally more avoidant of negative situations. For participants who scored higher on a measure of the Behavioral Inhibition System, which reflects a tendency to avoid aversive stimuli, a notable pattern emerged. In the control condition, these individuals found it difficult to follow the “enhance” instruction—they struggled to voluntarily increase their negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the slow-paced breathing exercise, this was no longer the case; they became just as capable of enhancing their emotional experience as other participants. This finding hints that the calming effect of the breathing may provide a sense of safety that allows individuals to approach and engage with uncomfortable emotions in a more controlled way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study acknowledge some limitations. As a pilot study, the sample size of 13 participants was small, and the findings will need to be replicated with larger, more diverse groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A primary limitation was a potential “floor effect.” The breathing exercise was so effective at lowering negative feelings and arousal at baseline that it left little room for further reduction. In the breathing condition, the emotional ratings for the “maintain” instruction were already almost as low as the ratings for the “suppress” instruction in the control condition. This makes it difficult to determine how much additional benefit the cognitive reappraisal strategy provided on top of the breathing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address this by using more intensely negative stimuli. Future studies should also incorporate direct physiological measurements, such as heart rate variability, to confirm that the observed emotional benefits are indeed linked to increased activity in the body’s calming parasympathetic nervous system. It would also be valuable to compare the effectiveness of different breathing techniques and paces to optimize the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941251329856" target="_blank"&gt;Acute Effects of Slow-Paced Breathing on Emotion Regulation: A Pilot Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Laura B.

He’d often ask his friends if they wanted to play basketball, tennis or something else together. “Through tennis, I discovered &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/pickleball-best-sport-to-live-longer-rcna186956" target="_blank"&gt;pickleball&lt;/a&gt;. That was the hook for me in terms of living a healthier and active lifestyle. I’ve become a&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/pickleball-why-sport-good-your-health-t237464" target="_blank"&gt; pickleball fanatic&lt;/a&gt;,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8eabe" class="body-graf"&gt;In December 2023, he joined &lt;a href="https://www.lifetime.life/"&gt;Life Time&lt;/a&gt;. “One thing I appreciate there is the community.

Some people say going to the gym is a chore, but I’m excited to go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-867a5b" class="body-graf"&gt;"There are endorphins you get from exercising, from being around others and from having that community," he says. "In the past, going to the gym was a solo grind, and I had to force myself to go. Now, it’s not a chore. It’s part of my lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd7f3b" class="body-graf"&gt;Having friends at the gym and at pickleball builds accountability for him, too. “My friends will say, ‘Ethan, I’ll see you tomorrow.’ And, of course, then I go after work. They’re expecting me,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-746b57" class="body-graf"&gt;He has also joined some running clubs, such as Pitch &amp;amp; Run, and now he’s working toward an ambitious goal — &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/sheinelle-jones-reflects-new-york-city-marathon-time-rcna123749" target="_blank"&gt;running the New York City marathon&lt;/a&gt; in November.

    &lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have believed that inflammation inevitably increases with age, quietly fuelling diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24833586/"&gt;heart disease, dementia and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00888-0"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of Indigenous populations challenges that idea and could reshape how we think about ageing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have identified chronic low-level inflammation – called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10911963/"&gt;“inflammaging”&lt;/a&gt; – as one of the primary drivers of age-related diseases. Think of it as your body’s immune system stuck in overdrive – constantly fighting battles that don’t exist, gradually wearing down organs and systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But inflammaging might not be a universal feature of ageing after all. Instead, it could be a byproduct of how we live in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;, compared patterns of inflammation in four very different communities around the world. Two groups were from modern, industrialised societies – older adults living in Italy and Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two were Indigenous communities who live more traditional lifestyles: the Tsimane people of the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli in the forests of Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed blood samples from more than 2,800 people, looking at a wide range of inflammatory molecules, known as cytokines. Their goal was to find out whether a pattern seen in earlier studies – where certain signs of inflammation rise with age and are linked to disease – also appears in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, it turns out, is both yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the Italian and Singaporean participants, the researchers found a fairly &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-319-99375-1"&gt;consistent inflammaging pattern&lt;/a&gt;. As people aged, levels of inflammatory markers in the blood, such as C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor, rose together. Higher levels were linked to a greater risk of chronic diseases including kidney disease and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the Tsimane and Orang Asli populations, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33100820/"&gt;inflammaging pattern was absent&lt;/a&gt;. The same inflammatory molecules did not rise consistently with age, and they were not strongly linked to age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, among the Tsimane, who face high rates of infections from parasites and other pathogens, inflammation levels were often elevated. Yet this &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30752-3/abstract"&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt; lead to the same rates of chronic diseases that are common in industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite high inflammatory markers, the Tsimane experience very low rates of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inflammaging may not be universal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results raise important questions. One possibility is that inflammaging, at least as measured through these blood signals, is not a universal biological feature of ageing. Instead, it may arise in societies marked by high-calorie diets, low physical activity and reduced exposure to infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, chronic inflammation linked to ageing and disease might not simply result from an inevitable biological process, but rather from a mismatch between our ancient physiology and the modern environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that in communities with more traditional lifestyles – where people are more active, eat differently and are exposed to more infections – the immune system may work in a different way. In these groups, higher levels of inflammation might be a normal, healthy response to their environment, rather than a sign that the body is breaking down with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that inflammaging may still occur in all humans, but it might appear in different ways that are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35246947/"&gt;not captured by measuring inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt; in the blood. It could be happening at a cellular or tissue level, where it remains invisible to the blood tests used in this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Chronic low-level inflammation may be a lifestyle problem.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/asian-fat-man-enjoy-eat-unhealthy-2213279091"&gt;Nattakorn_Maneerat/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these findings are confirmed, they could have significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, they challenge how we diagnose and treat chronic inflammation in ageing. Biomarkers used to define inflammaging in European or Asian populations might not apply in other settings, or even among all groups within industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, they suggest that lifestyle interventions aimed at lowering chronic inflammation, such as exercise, changes in diet, or drugs targeting specific inflammatory molecules, might have different effects in different populations. What works for people living in cities might be unnecessary, or even ineffective, in those living traditional lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this research serves as an important reminder that much of our knowledge about human health and ageing comes from studies conducted in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28429567/"&gt;wealthy, industrialised nations&lt;/a&gt;. Findings from these groups cannot automatically be assumed to apply worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are clear: this study is just the beginning. They urge scientists to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00082-y"&gt;dig deeper&lt;/a&gt;, using new tools that can detect inflammation not just in the blood, but within tissues and cells where the real story of ageing may be unfolding. Just as important, they call for more inclusive research that spans the full range of human experience, not just the wealthy, urbanised corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the very least, this study offers an important lesson. What we thought was a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317232120"&gt;universal truth about the biology of ageing&lt;/a&gt; might instead be a local story, shaped by our environment, lifestyle and the way we live.&lt;/p&gt;

I said, ‘Yes, of course. I’m with them until the end — but I want answers.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;Finally, after ruling out every infection and illness they could think of, the vets landed on a likely cause: cerebellar hypoplasia — a brain condition caused by exposure to feline panleukopenia virus in the womb that affects balance and coordination. It’s not curable, but it’s also not painful, and it’s not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="9"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;So, Lyle made a decision: “I said, ‘I take this burden on. If euthanasia is the only option, let’s revisit it in a couple of months. Let’s see if this is going to get better.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;She and the rescue started researching physical therapy for cats. First, they tried water therapy in Lyle’s bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;“I hated it. I felt like I was traumatizing them,” she laughed. So, she tried play therapy instead. “We just played and played and played, all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-element-type="ParagraphImage" data-element-index="10" class="ParagraphImagestyles__ImageContainer-sc-puj0e1-0 hHKvH page-element paragraph-image "&gt;&lt;picture class="picture-tag picture-tag--lazy" data-testid="picture-tag"&gt;&lt;img class="" src="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3196889/792x930/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg" srcset="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3196889/792x930/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg 1000w, https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3196889/1584x1860/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg 2000w" alt="Cat siblings cuddle together" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/3196889/792x930/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg" alt="Cat siblings cuddle together"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="Caption-sc-1do4sd3-0 kEEwas caption__paragraph-image"&gt;&lt;span class="Credit-sc-ke5nu1-0 jmSitH"&gt;Macy Lyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="11"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;Slowly but surely, the kittens started getting stronger.

They can stand to drink water. They use the litter box on their own,” Lyle said, adding that she wished she could keep them. “They don’t know any different.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="163" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzospb001k3b6h6c09rgcn@published"&gt;I hooked up with an ex-boyfriend after five years, and we started to get to it until we realized neither he nor I had condoms. After he left, I was kind of stumped, as his dick seemed much smaller than it had when we were dating. He had lost about 30 pounds and everything I could find said most penises seem larger because of the loss of fat at the base of the pubis, not the opposite. And it didn’t just seem shorter, but less thick. Does aging do anything to shrink it, or was it just a psychological trick, me remembering it as bigger? Since we never did anything more, I could never judge if it might have felt the same, and the opportunity has never arisen to try to get together again. Since then, he met someone else, so I probably won’t have the opportunity to ever find out either. Do you know if this is possible, or am I cray-cray?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="184" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzospc001n3b6hfnyt0cze@published"&gt;Shrinkage is, indeed, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/penis-shrinkage"&gt;a thing&lt;/a&gt;—and it can be way longer lasting than the situational kind described on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GG2dF5PS0bI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Usually the change isn’t too drastic, but it may be observable to the eagle-eyed connoisseur. There are a few known causes for this, which include Peyronie’s disease, weight gain, and prostate surgery. Another culprit: erectile dysfunction. In these cases, “the thought is that the shrinkage occurs due to the loss of spontaneous and nocturnal erections,” explained Dr. Charles Welliver, director of men’s health at Albany Medical College. “This more frequent nourishing blood keeps the penis healthy. The every-so-often erections guys get for intercourse (on average most people have sex once a week) wouldn’t be enough to support good penile health and would lead to the shrinkage. The length maintenance is more about the erections and semi-elections (chubs if you will) that happen when not having sex.” Welliver actually discussed this topic in more detail, including ways of treating such shrinkage, on an upcoming episode of the How to Do It podcast on the specific topic of &lt;a href="https://slate.com/podcasts/how-to-do-it"&gt;“COVID dick.”&lt;/a&gt; So be on the lookout for that one.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s also possible that you’re misremembering. I’ve done that—every once in a while I’ll catch a FWB on the long lap and I’ll be slapped in the face with the realization that my memory was extremely generous with the inches. Again, it could be that your ex experienced one of the aforementioned conditions in the intervening time, but it could also be the rose-colored funhouse mirror of nostalgia coming from inside of you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzpzfi00233b6hoglv538d@published"&gt;Once again I am roped into a game that I would generally not elect to play, but am compelled to as a result of this job: Spot the Cheater. I wouldn’t be comfortable even taking a stab here without some hard data, so I come bearing it: Researchers in a 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8366826/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Clinical Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt; journal found by analyzing 21 pharyngeal gonorrhea infections, that the estimated median duration of untreated infections was 16.3 weeks. Quite short of the “well over a year” that you’re inquiring about. Many infections cleared spontaneously in much shorter time periods, or so suggest the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzpzfi00243b6hhfaj9lap@published"&gt;Keep in mind that data on this are scant, primarily because of the ethical barriers in monitoring untreated infections. This study overcame those hurdles by having the men who participated (who all had sex with men) swab themselves on a weekly basis, and then those results were frozen and not tested until the participants had completed the 48-week study. They were told to be screened for STDs as usual, and many were treated with antibiotics over the course of the experiment, as the study notes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzpzfi00253b6hqtduj9wn@published"&gt;For another layer of certainty—the condom unrolled over our proverbial PrEP bottle if you will—I consulted with some experts. Dr. Lindley Barbee, the lead author on that study, as well as a professor at the University of Washington and the medical director of public health at the Seattle and King County Sexual Health Clinic, pointed out in an email that, “pharyngeal GC usually doesn’t produce many symptoms, so if you equate dormancy with symptom status, it is pretty much a ‘dormant infection’ by definition. Definitely will only be found if tested.” Barbee also emphasized that her study should be taken for what it is—a series of observations. “There could certainly be longer infections, but that has not been observed,” she wrote. Finally, Barbee reminds us to keep in mind that gonorrhea &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/629209"&gt;may be spread via kissing&lt;/a&gt;. If extracurricular make-out sessions are allowed in your arrangement, that could potentially be one pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

Hunter Handsfield&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus, University of Washington, and a nationally recognized STD expert. “Two years is an awfully long time,” he told me by phone. “I would be skeptical if someone said they had pharyngeal gonorrhea for two years, and only now transmitted it to his or her partner.” OK, to cover our bases, let’s be conservative, I said. How about one year? “One year is also unlikely,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzpzfi00273b6hkoq6mtlh@published"&gt;Handsfield also pointed out that the majority of pharyngeal cases of gonorrhea present no symptoms. “Most people have no clue anything is wrong. My guess is this has nothing to do with [the partner’s] sore throats,” said Handsfield. (Though, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/sexually-transmitted-diseases/oral-gonorrhea"&gt;sore throats can certainly be symptoms &lt;/a&gt;of oral gonorrhea.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzrb00002o3b6hen47epl7@published"&gt;My husband and I have been married for 28 years. We have always had a good sex life and companionship. We went through a bit of a hard time when we had stage three cancer, but we got through and now he always says if we can get through that we can get through anything. We have always had kids in our lives, as I brought a child from a previous relationship with me and had one of our own shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzrb01002p3b6h6fppo6o9@published"&gt;Recently, I found instant messages from another woman. Needless to say, I was stunned and hurt. My husband says it was just “chatting” and nothing happened nor did he want anything to happen. I was just recently diagnosed with endometriosis and the timing of this couldn’t be worse. I felt like I wasn’t good enough, pretty enough, that my disease (despite the fact I stood by him when he had his) was getting in the way. He said that wasn’t the case, and it was just a “mistake” and since it upset me so much he would stop and not do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmckzrb01002q3b6h2xqnjawv@published"&gt;But since that happened, I feel a “disconnect” with him. I still enjoy being with him, but can’t look or feel the same way about him. I know he didn’t physically cheat on me, but it still feels like a betrayal. He’s hot and cold—I never know what he’s thinking now. It just seems like we can’t get on the same page since this happened. What do I do? I really don’t want a divorce or open marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

Hopefully, he acknowledges the pain he’s caused you. But even then, you still won’t be out of the woods. Time is often necessary to rebuild trust—it is one thing for a (roughly) unfaithful partner to apologize, it is another thing to atone. That means living the apology. I suspect this is too new for the trust to have been rebuilt (and certainly his hot and cold attitude is no help in that matter). If you want to see this through, trusting him may look like a suspension of disbelief for a while. You have to go out on a limb and actively engage in the process of trusting him as you once did—provided that he warrants such mental heavy lifting. Reminding yourself of the fact that you trust him and why you’re with him at all may be useful. The disconnect is not great. I suspect he’s dealing with a good amount of shame and perhaps cannot quite embrace the full extent of his offense. He should, though, and you might want to look into counseling. An impartial third party could help you both see the other person’s perspective and get you that much closer to being on the same page again.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that processed meat isn't particularly good for us, having already been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-long-study-links-red-meat-to-up-to-13-higher-dementia-risk"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-30-less-of-one-type-of-meat-could-prevent-future-type-2-diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/so-processed-meat-has-been-classified-as-carcinogenic-here-s-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but how much of it counts as a 'safe' level of consumption? According to new research, there's no such thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US researchers reviewed over 70 previous studies (involving several million participants in total), analyzing the relationships between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-processed_food"&gt;ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt; and three health issues: type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166724" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, ischemic heart disease, and colorectal  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="166724" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations for processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat"&gt;trans fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; were looked into, and it was the processed meat that came out with the worst results – even if the amount eaten is only small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The monotonic increases in health risk with increased consumption of processed meat suggest that there is not a 'safe' amount of processed meat consumption with respect to diabetes or colorectal cancer risk," the team from the University of Washington in Seattle &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03775-8"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-better-sleep-could-be-as-simple-as-eating-more-fruit-and-veggies?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Secret to Better Sleep Could Be As Simple As Eating More Fruit And Veggies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to put the research into context. The associations found are relatively weak, they don't prove direct cause and effect, and the analyzed studies relied on self-reported &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-simply-by-changing-your-diet-massive-study-finds"&gt;dietary habits&lt;/a&gt; (which may not be completely accurate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study has several strengths too – it uses a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01973-2"&gt;Burden of Proof&lt;/a&gt; method, which is more conservative when assessing impacts on health. The results tend to be minimum values, which means they likely underestimate the true health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166727" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166727" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/DiabetesChart.jpg" alt="Diabetes chart" class="wp-image-166727 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/DiabetesChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/DiabetesChart-600x278.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166727" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers charted processed meat consumption against health conditions, including type 2 diabetes. (Haile et al, &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's particularly notable here is that minimal increases in consumption still raised risk levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease and colorectal cancer," University of Washington nutrition biologist Demewoz Haile told &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/02/health/processed-meats-sweet-drinks-disease-wellness"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the equivalent of one hot dog a day was associated with at least an 11 percent greater risk of type 2 diabetes, and at least a 7 percent greater risk of colorectal cancer, compared to eating no processed meat at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For beverages, an extra &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-quantified-the-harm-of-sugary-drinks-and-its-devastating"&gt;can of sugar-sweetened pop&lt;/a&gt; a day was linked to a 8 greater risk of type 2 diabetes, and a 2 percent greater risk of ischemic heart disease, compared to not drinking anything sugary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For trans fatty acids, a small daily amount was associated with a 3 percent increase in risk of ischemic heart disease, compared with zero consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This information provides critical data for public health specialists and policymakers responsible for dietary guidelines and potential initiatives that aim to reduce the consumption of these processed foods," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03775-8"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study has limitations, its scale and conservative methodology make it worth taking note of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is backed up &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03782-9"&gt;by a commentary&lt;/a&gt; in the same journal, which does note the role of ultra-processed foods in improving food accessibility and shelf life, particularly in areas with limited access to fresh food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message from the research team is that cutting out ultra-processed foods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-review-of-ultra-processed-foods-confirms-just-how-harmful-they-are"&gt;as much as possible&lt;/a&gt; is the best option for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03775-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Beans, beans, the magical fruit. The more you eat, the more you … can cut down on dangerous, chronic low-grade inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Illinois Institute of Technology recently discovered just how much &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eating-beans-daily-helps-lower-cholesterol-reduce-inflammation-study-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;black beans can help lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in a remarkable trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They gave roughly two dozen people with prediabetes a three-month supply of canned beans. The directions were simple: incorporate one cup of black beans into your diet, every single day for 12 weeks. (In a control group, participants ate white rice instead).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people mixed their beans into soups, others topped their salads with black beans. Each person in the bean-eating group just had to ensure they were eating a cup per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's something that people living in the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-zones-expert-shares-cheap-longevity-supplements-beans-walnuts-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt; around the world already do automatically, through force of habit. With this study,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;there's fresh evidence that their technique can help anybody who is at risk of developing chronic diseases improve their health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="83ba692c-67cb-42fc-9f84-0e8ff15624e0" data-toc-id="83ba692c-67cb-42fc-9f84-0e8ff15624e0"&gt;Black beans owe their dark, deep hue to plant chemicals that may also help fend off inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In this small study, eating black beans had a big impact on people's levels of a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) which is a key marker of inflammation. During the course of the study, black bean eaters reduced their average IL-6 levels from 2.57 picograms per milliliter to 1.88, a significant decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Indika Edirisinghe, a professor of food science and nutrition at IIT, says he suspects a big part of the reason why black beans are so great at lowering chronic, low-grade inflammation has to do with the chemicals that give them their rich, deep black coloring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have something called polyphenolic compounds," Edirisinghe told Business Insider. "The polyphenolic compounds are bioactive, and they have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S. and has multiple causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing sunscreen and avoiding excess sun exposure are the best protection. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research shows antioxidants may also help guard against this common cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Spending time outside can boost your mood, promote better sleep and support your immune system (plus, it’s free!). The only drawback is that outdoor time also exposes you to the sun’s skin-damaging UV rays. Over time, that could set the stage for skin cancer, the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “By far, the top risk factor for developing skin cancer is unprotected UV exposure, followed by genetic predisposition,” says dermatologist &lt;a href="https://facetdermatology.com/en-us/pages/our-team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Geeta Yadav, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is good news, though. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  many cases of skin cancer are largely preventable. Adopting safe sun habits like applying a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913195/best-reef-safe-sunscreens/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broad-spectrum sunscreen&lt;/a&gt;, wearing a hat, sunglasses and clothes that cover your arms and legs, and staying in the shade can all lower your UV exposure and significantly reduce your risk. So can avoiding tanning beds, which also emit large amounts of UV light.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also bolster your skin’s defenses from the inside out by eating more antioxidants. While diet plays a smaller role in skin cancer prevention, research reveals that antioxidants can provide additional protection to safeguard your skin from this all-too-common cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-antioxidants-may-protect-against-skin-cancer"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Antioxidants May Protect Against Skin Cancer &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skin cancer occurs when abnormal skin cells develop in the skin’s outermost layer, called the epidermis. What causes those abnormal cells to develop and grow? The most common cause is DNA damage from exposure to UV rays, either from the sun or tanning beds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, there are other risk factors too, like getting older or having a family history of skin cancer. You may also be more likely to develop skin cancer if you have blue or green eyes, red or blond hair, or have skin that’s fair or burns or freckles easily. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, most of these risk factors are beyond your control. But there is one helpful step you can take, and that’s eating an antioxidant-rich diet. In fact, research has found that dietary &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054507/best-antioxidant-rich-anti-inflammatory-fruits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; can help counteract some of the damage caused by UV exposure before it turns into cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And the list is long: selenium, zinc, copper, carotenoids, polyphenols and vitamins A, C and E may all be protective, according to research. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Combat Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exposure to UV light sets off a chain reaction that creates a storm of skin-damaging compounds called free radicals. That’s where antioxidants step in. “Antioxidants combat free radicals, unstable molecules that can damage cells and their DNA, proteins and lipids,” says Yadav. “When there are too many free radicals in the body to the point that antioxidants cannot help neutralize them, oxidative stress occurs, leading to cellular dysfunction. This dysfunction could manifest as early signs of aging, but it could also manifest as cancer.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Regularly consuming antioxidant-rich foods equips your body with the defenders needed to neutralize those free radicals before they cause long-term harm. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They May Prevent the Spread of Cancerous Cells &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not all DNA damage leads to cancer. In fact, our bodies have a natural defense mechanism to kill off DNA-damaged cells before they turn cancerous and start to spread.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s not foolproof, and some damage can fall through the cracks. Fortunately, research reveals that antioxidants called anthocyanins may help speed the process. While anthocyanins are found in lots of fruits and vegetables, one of the best sources for skin protection is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/22787/ingredients/fruit/berries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt;. So, load up on these juicy fruits for an extra dose of prevention. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Help Boost Internal Sun Protection &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sunburns aren’t just painful. This inflammatory reaction in your skin can cause long-lasting damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Enter &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053196/foods-skin-protection-sun-damage/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;. Research has found that they help absorb some of the sun’s harmful UV rays and reduce inflammation to decrease the development of sunburn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, one study found that carotenoids, antioxidants found in yellow, orange and red fruits and vegetables, could provide the equivalent sun protection to SPF 4 sunscreen.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For the biggest bang, think tomatoes. They’re filled with a carotenoid called lycopene that’s been shown to guard against sun damage from the inside out.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat the Rainbow:&lt;/strong&gt; An easy rule of thumb for adding &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;more antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; to your diet is to add more color to your plate. Fruits and vegetables with bright, deep hues are often the richest source of these beneficial compounds. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brew a Cup of Green Tea&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a reason green tea is added to face creams, masks and serums. It’s rich in antioxidants called catechins that have been shown to calm UV-related skin inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savor Some Dark Chocolate: &lt;/strong&gt;While chocolate may not prevent skin cancer, it contains inflammation-taming antioxidants called polyphenols that may improve skin hydration and circulation. Since dark chocolate contains the most polyphenols, the darker the chocolate, the better!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting regular skin checks and practicing safe sun habits like applying sunscreen, wearing a hat and protective clothing, and staying in the shade may all help reduce your risk of skin cancer. While diet plays a much smaller role, research has found that antioxidants may offer additional protection. Antioxidants are believed to combat cancer-causing oxidative stress, slow the spread of cancer cells and boost your body’s internal defenses against inflammation and sunburn. And the best way to get more of them isn’t a pill or powder. It’s a diet rich in colorful fruits and vegetables. So, before you hit the beach, park or pool, head to the produce aisle!&lt;br&gt;
