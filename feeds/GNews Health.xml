The deadly cases were seen in counties spread around Florida’s extensive coastline, from Bay County in the Panhandle and Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, on the Gulf Coast, to Broward County in southeastern Florida and St. Johns County just south of Jacksonville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c35e06" class="body-graf"&gt;Florida has seen 11 Vibrio vulnificus cases so far this year, the state’s health department says. The bacteria can get into the body through open wounds in the skin and cause the surrounding tissue to die, a condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. People can also get Vibrio vulnificus from eating contaminated foods, particularly raw oysters. It’s unclear how the people in Florida were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17648c" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1 in 5 people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f2d2fe" class="body-graf"&gt;Antarpreet Jutla, an engineering professor at the University of Florida who researches Vibrio bacteria, said Vibrio vulnificus infections are still rare, though they tend to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hurricane-idalia-concerns-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna102181" target="_blank"&gt;increase after hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, Florida saw a total of 82 cases, which may have been exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/hurricanes/hurricane-season-ends-rcna181808" target="_blank"&gt;“extremely active” hurricane season.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a50f4b" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Vibrio vulnificus? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-810fd0" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is one of over 200 species of Vibrio bacteria, said Rita Colwell, a professor emerita of microbiology at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4ffa7d" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of Vibrio infections aren’t harmful to humans, Jutla said. Some only affect other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dfa96b" class="body-graf"&gt;But Vibrio bacteria do cause about 80,000 infections in people each year, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Most of those cases are gastrointestinal. Only a small handful — 100 to 200 cases — are due to Vibrio vulnificus. Other Vibrio species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus, are often the cause of those stomach illnesses. Another type of Vibrio, Vibrio cholorae, causes the diarrheal disease cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d72eef" class="body-graf"&gt;Because Vibrio bacteria prefer warm water, they are typically found along the southeastern shores of the U.S., but are also found on the West Coast as well. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/fear-warming-oceans-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna75935" target="_blank"&gt;As ocean temperatures warm&lt;/a&gt;, more cases have been found further north in recent years, Jutla said, including some in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/3-people-die-flesh-eating-bacteria-infections-new-york-connecticut-pro-rcna100364" target="_blank"&gt;New York, Connecticut and Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-1021e7" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bcd450" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio bacteria can creep in open wounds after spending time in salty or brackish water, said Dr. Norman Beatty, an infectious disease doctor at University of Florida Health. Most cases he’s seen have been associated with spending extended time in the water, but he says that a brief exposure could be the “only thing needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-767532" class="body-graf"&gt;Visible signs of an infection can start in just a few hours, Beatty said, and include redness, swelling and “bull’s-eye” blisters. The site will also be painful. If infection progresses, it can get into the bloodstream and cause sepsis, which can be deadly. Symptoms of sepsis include fever, chills and dangerously low blood pressure, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d34a99" class="body-graf"&gt;People with liver cirrhosis, weakened immune systems and those over 65 are most at risk for infection, Jutla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df6724" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus infections can be treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-af371a" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent Vibrio infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0d1f0e" class="body-graf"&gt;Beatty said he recommends covering up any open wounds before going into the ocean. Even a waterproof Band-Aid does the job, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50fd5d" class="body-graf"&gt;If people think they have an infection, they should seek care immediately, Beatty said. Delaying can be the difference between developing severe complications and a more mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c4947" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“A delay in presenting to health care is truly the likely reason why most people have a more serious outcome than others,” he said. “People who present within the same day with signs and symptoms of early infection, who receive antibiotics, can do well and can avoid a lot of these serious complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNSTFyZGgtUHhWLWhLT1pZX2QxTmtLdEdyNlI5TmpQZnBoWHQ4NkJFdFJqNE5fdWpCaFVPdVFYbkpBUmV3X3pxMXk4MnZNTGdUdGg0SHB5VGZjOXoyQVM5QnlmTjd1dnN5X0VDYUI1b0N1bldGUDZlNTRiZi16dllReGw0aFgyOEtIbDRaa1dzOWNoUlZvTEVqb2xubXp5eXRVdmwtLdIBVkFVX3lxTFBqb2EyX05aVUJTNDhubXpDbGgxeEdVNlZYR2Y4NGota1VpSVV6QXF4c3J1UFozeGc4elQyUzk3ZmJxdXpRdHJ6TU5MY2h3ZjZLMGtSNk13</guid></item><item><title>高蛋白零食值得大肆宣传吗？以下是评估方法- NPR | Are high-protein snacks worth the hype?

                Protein has taken over the packaged-snack aisles at the grocery store. But do you need extra protein in your chips and muffins?

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Protein has never gone out of style. While fat was demonized as the nutrient causing weight gain in the 1990s, followed by carbs in the 2000s, protein sat by the sidelines as the official people pleaser of the macro-nutrient world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You need essential amino acids in the diet in order to sustain life," says Stefan Pasiakos, director of the Center for Human Performance Optimization at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Protein is needed for building and repairing muscle and tissues and helps support your immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Protein stepped into the spotlight in recent years as keto and other high-protein diets took off. Health and fitness influencers started to push everyone to eat more muscle-building foods in every meal (deep-fried &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdQFw-_vKpY" target="_blank"&gt;cottage cheese Doritos&lt;/a&gt; anyone?) The nutrient is so ubiquitous online that one influencer asks whether &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFWBepuNApm/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;protein can leave him alone for five minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And it has now taken over the snack food aisles, with "high-protein" or "protein-packed" labels on the front of products as diverse as sweet rolls, chips and pretzels. There's even a &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SNICKERS-HI-PROTEIN-BAR-ORIGINAL-4CT/3988040815?" target="_blank"&gt;high-protein version&lt;/a&gt; of a Snickers bar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Leaning into protein claims on packaging&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of course, these claims don't always mean the food is good for you or even a good source of protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You'll see chips labeled high protein," says Pasiakos, who is a former director of the National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements. "In reality, they're probably not, but people are now trying to jump all over it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The global protein-snacks market alone is projected to grow from $50 billion in 2024 to $101 billion by 2032, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/protein-snacks-market-110937" target="_blank"&gt;Fortune Business Insights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Snack-makers often market protein front and center on their packaging without mentioning the food's sugar content, says Pasiakos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For instance, a candy with 1 gram of protein may have a high-protein marketing claim on the front of the package and to the maker, "it may not even be a false claim because they're thinking, 'If you looked at another candy, it's not going to have a gram of protein in it,'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among many examples, Smash Foods' cashew butter and blueberry jam Snack Bites, sold at Whole Foods, advertises 5g of protein, yet it has 16g of sugar, more than triple its protein amount. 365 Chewy Protein Bites aren't much better, with various flavors having about 20g of sugar to 10g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration regulates marketing claims on packaged foods, restricting manufacturers from making big, overarching health claims without proof. For instance, companies can't claim their food prevents heart attacks or cures cancer, Pasiakos says. They also &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/19/nx-s1-5234143/fda-healthy-food-labels-diet" target="_blank"&gt;can't use the word "healthy"&lt;/a&gt; or derivatives of the word without meeting the FDA healthy standards of providing a specific amount of a nutrient within a food group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So saying something is "high protein" can be a way of working around the regulations while signaling to consumers that a food might be good for them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to judge? Try a little math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So how do you determine whether a snack making protein claims is worth eating? Pasiakos offers this simple calculation to get a sense of what share of the food's total calories is derived from protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Take the number of grams of protein in the product and multiply it by 4 — that's the number of calories &lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/programs/fnic" target="_blank"&gt;per gram of protein&lt;/a&gt;. Now you know the calories from protein in the food. Then take the protein calories and divide by the total calories in the food. That gives you the share of calories in the food that comes from protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For instance, let's say a protein bar has 20 grams of protein and 200 calories. You'd multiply 20 × 4 to get 80. Then you'd divide 80 by 200 and get 40%. "Anything that was high in protein would have 30% or more of protein by calorie count," says Pasiakos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another option would be to check the percentage of the daily value (listed as DV) of protein listed on the Nutrition Facts label on the package. Anything 20% or above can be seen as high protein, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels#:~:text=5%25%20DV%20or%20less%20of,per%20serving%20is%20considered%20high" target="_blank"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But even if a snack is high in protein, is it automatically healthy? Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Protein's important, but it's not the only nutrient we should be looking at," says Clare Parme Miller, a New York-based registered dietician for &lt;a href="https://lifewaysnutrition.com/clare-parme-miller/" target="_blank"&gt;Lifeways Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. It's equally important to get enough of other nutrients like fiber and to avoid foods high in added sugars or highly processed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Look for snacks with added sugars of less than 10 grams that are less processed than most protein bars," she suggests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, you may not need your snacks to be high protein, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal government suggests adults get at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 per pound), which is 51 grams for a 140-pound woman who isn't pregnant or breastfeeding. Some nutrition and fitness experts recommend more, especially for those seeking to build muscle and for older people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when it comes to snack time, says Parme Miller, "especially if you're getting 20 to 30 grams of protein at mealtime, snacks only need to provide 10 to 15 grams."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;(The &lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture has a handy nutrient calculator&lt;/a&gt; that takes into consideration your age and activity level.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Whole foods snacks can pack in protein too&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's not hard to meet protein minimums with whole foods, says Parme Miller, instead of reaching for packaged snacks with protein claims.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Greek yogurt or small cups of cottage cheese will fulfill your protein requirement and also provide calcium," says Parme Miller. Add berries for a boost in fiber and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nuts without other added ingredients and roasted chickpeas, in single-serving sizes, provide less protein than Greek yogurt but can be paired with other items to get to 10 grams. For instance, you could add whole grain crackers to boost protein a bit and get another food group in. An ounce of cheese plus a few whole grain crackers also gives you protein and whole grains, which are high in fiber and contain calcium and several B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other whole grain plus protein snacks include smearing a nut butter on whole grain crackers or doing the same with hummus, says Parme Miller. Adding broccoli or another vegetable for dipping slightly ups the protein value and adds fiber and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Whatever you do, don't eat gobs and gobs of protein, even if it says high protein on the label," says Parme Miller.

&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling with low energy, bloating, poor immunity, skin issues or anxiety, then your gut could be trying to tell you something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Shona Wilkinson, lead nutritionist at supplement and nutrition brand &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=21553&amp;amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;amp;clickref=fitandwell-gb-7007324559945435934&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com%2F" target="_blank" data-url="https://drvegan.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=21553&amp;amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;amp;clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com%2F" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="DR.VEGAN" data-merchant-id="305958" data-merchant-network="AW" data-merchant-url="drvegan.com"&gt;Dr. Vegan&lt;/a&gt; (which offers gut-friendly supplement &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=21553&amp;amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;amp;clickref=fitandwell-gb-6997866224999913041&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com%2Fproducts%2Fgut-works" target="_blank" data-url="https://drvegan.com/products/gut-works" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=21553&amp;amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;amp;clickref=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fdrvegan.com%2Fproducts%2Fgut-works" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="DR.VEGAN" data-merchant-id="305958" data-merchant-network="AW" data-merchant-url="drvegan.com"&gt;Gut Works&lt;/a&gt;), gut health becomes even more important as we get older—and it’s likely a part of the body we’ve overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people forget that the gut does much more than simply digest your food,” says Wilkinson. “Gut health impacts energy, concentration, your immune system, your ability to sleep and much more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we age, our gut health naturally changes, often in ways that impact our overall wellbeing. Maintaining gut health in later life is crucial for immune function, skin health, metabolic balance, day-to-day comfort and also our mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about how your gut changes over time and Wilkinson’s expert five-step plan on how to support a healthy gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-happens-to-the-gut-as-we-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What happens to the gut as we age?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most notable changes is the diversity of our microbiome, which is composed of the trillions of bacteria and microorganisms that live inside our gut,” explains Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that a rich, diverse microbiome is the secret to a healthy gut, it’s only natural that issues tend to occur as this diversity declines. This imbalance, known as dysbiosis, can contribute to inflammation, reduced immunity, constipation and poor nutrient absorption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SxibJVXBs2efAtF6R4Kr7o" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-SxibJVXBs2efAtF6R4Kr7o slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ageing process also slows down something called gut motility, meaning food moves more slowly through the digestive system, which can lead to constipation and discomfort. Plus, stomach acid production often decreases as we get older, making it harder to break down food and absorb key nutrients such as B12, calcium and magnesium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-five-step-plan-for-a-healthy-gut-3"&gt;The five-step plan for a healthy gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-eat-probiotic-rich-foods-daily"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Eat probiotic-rich foods daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented foods like kimchi, yogurt and sauerkraut naturally contain an abundance of probiotics— the good live bacteria that can boost your gut health, says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of your age, try adding at least one probiotic-rich food to your diet every day to help restore microbial balance and support digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-cut-back-on-ultra-processed-foods"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Cut back on ultra-processed foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Highly processed foods often contain additives, emulsifiers and excess sugar that damages your gut microbiome and increases inflammation in the gut,” warns Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you get older and your body struggles to break down foods, it’s important to limit the amount of ultra-processed food you consume to maintain gut health. Instead, try and opt for whole, natural foods wherever possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-stay-hydrated"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Stay hydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keeping ourselves hydrated is important regardless of our age—though you may find yourself going to the bathroom slightly more often as you get older!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more hydrated we are, the smoother our digestive system runs—this helps to prevent constipation, supports the lining of our intestines and keeps things running smoothly. Whether you’re in your early 20s or pushing 70, try and keep yourself hydrated by consuming lots of water throughout the day,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-keep-moving"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Keep moving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical activity enhances gut motility, reduces inflammation and promotes a more diverse microbiome. Even a daily &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/forget-the-gym-this-30-minute-walking-workout-will-help-you-clock-up-6-000-steps-and-boost-your-cardio" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/forget-the-gym-this-30-minute-walking-workout-will-help-you-clock-up-6-000-steps-and-boost-your-cardio"&gt;30-minute walk&lt;/a&gt; can make a huge difference to gut function and overall wellbeing,” says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-prioritize-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Prioritize sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lack of sleep can have a hugely negative effect on your gut health,” Wilkinson adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can disrupt your gut flora and increase the amount of stress hormones in the body, which in turn can affect digestion. Counter this by trying to keep a regular bedtime, limit screen use before bed, and avoid caffeine in the afternoon to ensure a good night’s sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

Rich in antioxidants and naturally occurring compounds, coffee has been associated with improved cognitive function, better metabolic health, and reduced risk of certain chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s. However, many people unknowingly develop habits that diminish these benefits. According to health.com, from drinking coffee too late in the day to using it as a meal replacement or overloading it with sugar, these mistakes can interfere with sleep, hydration, gut health, and overall wellness. Health experts weigh in on the most common coffee-drinking mistakes and how to correct them for optimal results and sustained energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 daily &lt;keyword id="27876272" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="coffee-drinking-habits" source="keywords"&gt;coffee drinking habits&lt;/keyword&gt; that could be harming you &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drinking coffee too late can disrupt sleep quality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine, the primary stimulant in coffee, can linger in the bloodstream for several hours, potentially interfering with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Studies have shown that consuming coffee even six hours before bedtime can significantly reduce sleep duration and quality. Since restorative sleep is essential for immune function, mental clarity, and overall health, experts recommend avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better sleep hygiene, stop consuming caffeinated beverages at least six hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unfiltered coffee may increase LDL cholesterol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While French press, Turkish coffee, and espresso are popular for their bold flavor, these brewing methods produce unfiltered coffee, which contains higher levels of diterpenes—specifically kahweol and cafestol. These compounds have been shown to elevate LDL (bad) cholesterol, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Choose filtered brewing methods like drip or pour-over to minimize the intake of cholesterol-raising compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excess &lt;keyword id="27355007" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="sugar-in-coffee" source="keywords"&gt;sugar in coffee&lt;/keyword&gt; undermines its health benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding large amounts of sugar, flavored syrups, or artificial creamers to coffee can turn a health-promoting beverage into a source of empty calories and added sugars. High sugar intake is linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and even mental health issues. It also disrupts the gut microbiome, which plays a vital role in immune function and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim to enjoy coffee black or lightly sweetened with natural alternatives to preserve its benefits without the sugar overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drinking coffee immediately after waking may blunt its effectiveness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people reach for their first cup of coffee as soon as they wake up, but doing so can interfere with the body's natural production of cortisol, a hormone that helps regulate energy levels. Drinking coffee too early may also disrupt adenosine, a neurotransmitter that helps promote restful sleep and wakefulness balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying coffee intake slightly may make it feel more effective and reduce your dependence on caffeine throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coffee should never replace a balanced meal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although coffee can slightly suppress appetite and is often associated with weight loss, it is not a suitable substitute for a meal. Coffee lacks essential nutrients such as protein, fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins required for sustained energy, blood sugar balance, and metabolic health. Skipping meals in favor of caffeine can result in mood swings, fatigue, and nutritional deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consume coffee alongside a balanced meal, particularly breakfast, to support metabolic function and avoid energy crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How smarter coffee habits can improve your well-being&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can be a powerful ally in promoting mental alertness, metabolic health, and overall wellness—if consumed correctly. Small changes in your coffee habits, such as avoiding late-day caffeine, limiting sugar, choosing filtered brewing methods, and ensuring it complements rather than replaces meals, can help you maximize its benefits without compromising your health. With expert-backed guidance, your daily cup of coffee can remain both a satisfying ritual and a health-positive habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/i-eat-a-donut-every-morning-elon-musks-surprisingly-fitness-routine-and-diet-unveiled/articleshow/122759263.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;‘I eat a donut every morning’; Elon Musk’s surprisingly fitness routine and diet unveiled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 05:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwJBVV95cUxPTUJqOVhadzhJQ0d5SjZ4d1BscmpzZm1qVUZpUkU0aTZOdnZvRG90QkJVOVU2NnprU0dUdHRFcUxvQ1h5dlkzbDdjZ1c5eXZrYzd1cDB2bmdDbW9FYTdSbG9meTVScEgycl9sY0FBSmVLS2E5UEgtOURUZlQ5bG4zSncyeGZmSXpMVm02Zml2MHotaGNkR3VoNDNkNGR3SE1Jd1BrcXM1WkhXZWg0TWlkYXpnVDJwSWQtRDlPMC0tRFBZMG9xQjNKa0dGNmVxelI0Q3I1T2NHVTVlcjZaUHZKdllFQ0FuQ1RvbEw0eXo1ZUNrdWtMbUUxbjE1d0VjeENvSTRGbHV5V0pYWnM</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，帮助你排便的6种最佳碳水化合物- EatingWell | The 6 Best Carbs to Help You Poop, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5hWnliSHFFMU1RRnR4RmhTTXlrMEFFWWM4d0Z6a09iRjJia1lGT0RZYWhrRGhlbTg4NFhESG9LcU50REF2eVlzRy0xOS1hRENBVGk1QmxKS2ZDNFhVRWlKeW5PRUdUdVVfNzRxa1FsSXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lentils contain a type of fiber called &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-resistant-starch-11749332" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;resistant starch that supports digestive health&lt;/a&gt; in several ways. One cup of cooked lentils provides about 16 grams of fiber, which helps add bulk to stool while promoting movement.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The resistant starch in lentils has &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prebiotic benefits that feed the beneficial gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; to help break down fiber and create short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids help support digestion, maintain a healthy colon and keep bowel movements regular.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Lentils are packed with soluble and insoluble fiber, which work together to support regularity and keep your gut happy,” says &lt;a href="https://healthdownsouth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jessie Winstead, RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Try adding cooked lentils to salads, soups or grain bowls.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An apple a day might help keep constipation away. Apples are high in pectin, a soluble fiber that acts as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11757815" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural stool softener&lt;/a&gt;. One medium apple provides about 4 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating it with the skin on adds even more insoluble fiber, which helps bulk up stool and promote regularity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Apples are also high in water, which can help lead to better bowel movements,” says Samuels-Garrison. Snack on raw apples, slice them into oatmeal or pair them with nut butter for extra nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/easiest-high-fiber-swap-for-gut-health-11741296" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole-wheat bread to your diet&lt;/a&gt; is a simple way to get more insoluble fiber, which helps move waste through the digestive system. Look for breads with at least 3 grams of fiber per slice to get the most benefit. Checking the ingredient list for “100% whole wheat” as the first ingredient can also help ensure that you’re getting a true whole-grain product that’s rich in nutrients and gut-friendly fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Carbs often get a bad rap, but the right ones can actually be your gut’s best friend,” Winstead says. Whole grains like whole-wheat bread also offer B vitamins and minerals that support energy and digestion.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sweet potatoes contain a mix of soluble and insoluble fiber, making them especially helpful for promoting regular bowel movements. They’re also rich in water, which can help soften stool naturally. With 8 grams of fiber per 1 cup, they’re a delicious, nutrient-dense option that supports digestion and keeps you satisfied.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enjoy them roasted, mashed or baked. Leave the skin on for an extra fiber boost.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans, including black beans and kidney beans, are loaded with fiber and prebiotic resistant starch to feed good gut bacteria. Just a half-cup serving can provide 7 to 8 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans and lentils contain resistant starches that support &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria,&lt;/em&gt; a bacterium which helps you digest fiber,” explains Samuels-Garrison. Start by slowly increasing your intake of beans and drink plenty of water to reduce gas and bloating.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to including these high-fiber carbs in your meals, there are other small steps you can take to help get things moving.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink water: &lt;/strong&gt;Staying hydrated softens stool and helps fiber do its job effectively. A common mistake is increasing fiber intake without also increasing water intake, which results in further constipation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular exercise can help stimulate digestion and relieve constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t ignore the urge:&lt;/strong&gt; Go when you feel the need. Waiting can increase the risk of constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Stress can slow down digestion. Take a few calming breaths throughout the day to help relax the body and digestive tract.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a routine: &lt;/strong&gt;Eating meals and visiting the bathroom around the same times each day can train your digestive system to stay regular.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbs that are loaded with fiber can be powerful foods to support digestive health and relieve constipation, thanks to gut-friendly prebiotics and stool-promoting benefits. “Fiber-rich carbs help add bulk and softness to your stool, making it easier to go,” Winstead says. Pair these foods with plenty of fluids, movement and consistent habits to keep your gut working smoothly. If constipation continues, consider talking to a health care professional to explore other solutions.&lt;br&gt;

As of 26 June, the number of malaria cases had risen to &lt;a href="https://x.com/MoHCCZim/status/1941038980050698434" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;119,648, with 334 deaths&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Zimbabwean health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The distribution of essential control methods, such as mosquito nets, was also disrupted, leaving hundreds of thousands of people exposed to mosquito bites across the country. The health ministry said in May that 1,615,000 insecticide-treated nets were being distributed but that there was a shortfall of 600,000 due to the withdrawal of US funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Itai Rusike, director of Zimbabwe’s Community Working Group on Health, said funding shortfalls were jeopardising the country’s significant gains against malaria over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Sustained domestic funding is critical to keep prevention and treatment efforts on track,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If mosquito nets and preventive medicines for pregnant women are unavailable, lives will be lost.

Cases in people under 50 have been on the rise for at least the past 20 years, maybe even 30. That steady climb has experts seriously concerned. According to the latest numbers from IARC, around 1.9 million people are diagnosed with it every year, and over 900,000 lose their lives to it globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why Daycare Cancer Centres Are a Game-Changer: Expert Insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of colon cancer in the United States is significant. In 2025, an estimated 154,270 new cases of colon cancer are expected to be diagnosed, representing about 7.6% of all new cancer cases. The incidence rate stands at approximately 37.1 new cases per 100,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower the risk of colon cancer, the following are science backed strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get regular screenings&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting at age 45, regular colorectal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/prevention/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;screenings &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;are one of the most effective ways to prevent colon cancer. Screenings like colonoscopies can detect precancerous polyps—tiny growths in the colon or rectum that could turn into cancer over time. Removing them early prevents cancer before it starts. If you have a family history or other risk factors, you may need to start even earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenings save lives by catching problems before symptoms appear. Talk to your doctor about which screening method is best for you and how often you should get tested based on your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which step do you think helps more in preventing colon cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maintain a healthy weight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying extra weight, especially around the belly, can increase inflammation and affect hormone levels that may raise your risk of colorectal cancer. Obesity is a major risk factor, so maintaining a healthy body weight through balanced eating and regular exercise is essential. Even losing a small amount of weight can make a big difference. Focus on gradual, sustainable habits like cutting back on processed foods, reducing portion sizes, and staying active. Avoid crash diets or quick fixes. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stay physically active&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days does more than just burn calories—it also lowers colon cancer risk. Physical activity helps regulate digestion, reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and boost immune function. Regular movement also helps counteract the harmful effects of prolonged sitting, which has been linked to higher cancer risk. You don’t need to be a gym rat—brisk walking, cycling, dancing, swimming, or even gardening count. The key is consistency. Bonus: exercise also reduces your risk for heart disease and boosts mood, so it’s a win all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat more plants &amp;amp; fiber&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet full of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts provides fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that support colon health. Fiber keeps things moving in your digestive tract, helping to flush out potential carcinogens. It also feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which can reduce inflammation and support immune function. Aim for a colorful plate—greens, berries, carrots, beans, brown rice, oats. These natural, nutrient-dense foods have been linked with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Processed snacks and sugar? Not so much. Your colon will thank you for going green and whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cut back on red &amp;amp; processed meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a burger now and then won’t doom you, studies consistently show that high consumption of red meat—like beef, pork, and lamb—and especially processed meats like bacon, sausage, and deli slices can increase your risk of colon cancer. These meats contain compounds that can damage the lining of your colon, especially when cooked at high temperatures. Try swapping meat for plant-based proteins like lentils, beans, tofu, or lean poultry and fish. If you do eat red meat, keep portions small and limit frequency. Save the bacon for special occasions—your gut health depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limit alcohol intake&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol increases your risk of colon cancer, especially if consumed regularly and in large amounts. Alcohol can damage the cells lining your colon and lead to inflammation, which may trigger cancer development over time. To lower your risk, stick to moderate drinking: no more than one drink per day for women and two for men—or better yet, cut back further or avoid it altogether. Swap alcohol with sparkling water, herbal tea, or mocktails for a healthier routine. Your liver, colon, and energy levels will all benefit from the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Don’t smoke&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking is a well-known cause of lung cancer, but it also significantly increases the risk of colorectal cancer. The harmful chemicals in tobacco travel through your bloodstream and digestive tract, damaging colon tissue and potentially leading to cancer over time. The longer you smoke, the higher the risk—but quitting at any stage brings benefits. If you smoke, get help to stop. Use nicotine patches, support groups, or talk to your doctor about quitting strategies. It’s one of the single best things you can do for your overall health—including your colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watch how you cook meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grilling, frying, or broiling meat at high temperatures can produce harmful chemicals like heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which may increase &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cancer &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;risk. You can reduce this risk by marinating meat before cooking (which can lower harmful compounds), flipping meat frequently to avoid charring, or using lower-heat cooking methods like baking or steaming. Choose lean cuts, trim visible fat, and avoid overcooking. If you love BBQ, balance it out with plenty of vegetables and fiber-rich sides. It’s not just what you eat—it’s also how you cook it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combine healthy habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no magic pill for cancer prevention, but the combo of multiple healthy habits has a powerful effect. Getting screened, exercising, keeping your weight in check, eating plant-based, skipping tobacco, limiting alcohol, and cooking smart all add up. Each habit stacks your odds in your favor and helps your body stay strong. Prevention isn't about perfection—it’s about giving yourself the best possible shot at long-term health. Make small changes, stay consistent, and remember: your daily choices can protect your future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This content is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

You’re told it's generally safe aside from needing a bit more sleep, and sometimes feeling like your head’s in a fog. But now... headlines say it might increase your risk of dementia by up to 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you yank your prescription and panic-type in Google, let’s break down what this all means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin is a medication first approved in 1993 for treating epilepsy. Soon after, its knack for reducing nerve pain—from post-shingles neuralgia to diabetic neuropathy—made it wildly popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s generally considered safer and less addictive than opioids. Side effects? Sure—sleepiness, dizziness, headaches, nausea. But for many, the relief from chronic pain outweighs those little annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New study: What did researchers do and find?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40639955/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine analyzed records from 68 U.S. health systems, comparing patients with chronic low back pain.

People with 12 or more prescriptions faced a 40% increased dementia risk and a 65% bump in MCI risk versus those with fewer prescriptions. Age mattered too. Those aged 35–64 saw more dramatic effects, with dementia risks doubling for 35–49-year-olds and MCI risk tripling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you ditch Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not without having a word with your doctor. Here’s the smart play:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors might explore alternatives, such as topical therapies, antidepressants (off-label), or even non-drug therapies like mindfulness or physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle remains king: exercise, brain games, healthy diet—all proven to protect cognition .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about other dementia-linked medications?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about gabapentin.

But could it also dull cognition over time? Possibly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic pain itself is linked to faster memory decline. So is pain causing dementia, or is gabapentin? Hard to say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of physical activity and social isolation often accompany chronic pain—and both are known dementia risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it might be a combination of factors, not just the drug itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should you do if you’re on Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a mini checklist to guide your next steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to your doctor—especially if you’ve been prescribed gabapentin frequently or long-term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about brain monitoring: cognitive assessments every year or two could catch changes early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore alternatives: viability depending on your condition—other meds or therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boost lifestyle defenses: walk, chat, do puzzles, eat well. (Yep, the brain benefits from spinach and Sudoku.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate your support system: family and friends can help notice memory lapses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t abruptly quit: stopping suddenly could worsen pain or trigger withdrawal—the switch should be managed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin has been a go-to painkiller, especially as we try to avoid opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research suggests a link to dementia risks, particularly with frequent/prolonged use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not a deal-breaker—especially if you use it responsibly and under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this is a wake-up call: time to talk to your doctor, think critically, and monitor brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin-dementia risk FAQs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does gabapentin really increase the risk of dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent research suggests that long-term or frequent use of gabapentin may be associated with a higher risk of developing dementia or mild cognitive impairment. However, the study was observational, so it doesn't prove causation. It highlights the need for more research and regular cognitive monitoring in long-term users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is most at risk from gabapentin-related cognitive issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that people aged 35 to 64, especially those who had 6 or more prescriptions over time, were at higher risk. Those with 12 or more prescriptions had up to a 40% increased risk of developing dementia compared to people who used less or none.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I stop taking gabapentin if I’m currently using it for pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;No—do not stop taking gabapentin suddenly, especially without consulting your doctor. If you're concerned, speak with your healthcare provider to review your dosage, explore alternatives, or discuss ways to monitor your cognitive health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there safer alternatives to gabapentin for managing nerve pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, depending on your condition. Alternatives include physical therapy, certain antidepressants, topical treatments, or other medications. Your doctor can recommend the best option based on your specific needs and health history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I protect my brain health while managing chronic pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides regular medical reviews, focus on brain-friendly habits: stay physically active, eat a balanced diet, manage stress, stay socially connected, and challenge your mind with puzzles, reading, or learning. These lifestyle habits can support cognitive function even while managing long-term pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 01:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>纽约州卫生部：麻疹患者本周访问了AMC的萨拉托加医院-《每日公报》 | NYSDOH: Measles patient visited Saratoga Hospital, AMC this week - The Daily Gazette</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNMS14bmJ0MURuemhSOTlRVGJkdmpDTEdGcjh5Wl84NVV4NnhLUXdXWmdGazlGZ3ZJMzFwaS10c3JJZEVjNzJGOHFDbi1uSWkzdG5tSHNNTnZNa3NKYWdCaGVVWEFzajhTSE5DZklqTTd5WjFEcEVvR0N1TmE4ZXlqel9yZ09Id1NQTTlNRVEtbDU5UUJrekdGWkpFZ0tCby1JcktwbEVFV1BHYksxcWgtM3dVYVN6clN6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="form-group-flex"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Multiple children have been treated in Wake County emergency
rooms for a rare, but painful skin condition in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Holly Rund shared her five-year-old daughter Lexi was in so
much pain last weekend that it caused Lexi to scream when she was touched. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“At first I thought it was hand-foot-and-mouth, and I
noticed she had a blister,” Holly recalled. “There were two on her legs and one
on her side.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi’s pain grew worse, and she said her skin became itchy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The one on her side, when I looked at it, that was when I
knew something wasn’t right. It was yellow and puffed out and really big,” Holly
said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi described her symptoms in three simple words: “It
really hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The mother took her daughter to the WakeMed Raleigh
emergency department on Sunday to get examined. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;That’s when the Runds learned Lexi had a rare but painful
condition called staphylococcal scalding skin syndrome (SSSS), also known as
Ritter’s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi was kept overnight and treated with IV fluids and antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Graham Snyder is an emergency physician who sees patients
at WakeMed Raleigh and is the medical director of the hospital system’s medical
simulation center. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician shared he treated a different patient with the
same condition earlier this week. It was the first time he'd seen the condition this year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“When I walked in the room and saw a patient recently, my first
thought was ‘Oh this is impetigo,’ which is just a little thing kids get from
scratching mosquito bites,” Snyder said. “The thing that was different was the
child had redness over their entire body, and their skin hurt. Normally rashes
don’t hurt. They may itch, but if a rash hurts you have to ask yourself if
something else is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Snyder explained the bacteria behind SSSS sometimes grows after
a child gets a cut, or if they have been scratching their skin a lot – like if
they have allergies or eczema.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Staphylococcus, which is just like the staph infection you’ve
always heard of, emits a toxin into the blood that goes into the skin and
damages the skin, almost like a burn,” Snyder explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The rash and sores may sometimes be initially misdiagnosed
with pediatricians as other conditions, like hand-foot-and-mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The combination of pain being everywhere in the body and sometimes
you can have a combination of fever at the same time, should kind of raise your
suspicion,” Snyder warned. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WakeMed has seen six cases so far this year, and all of them have
been pediatric.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Snyder says the number isn’t abnormal and added that multiple
cases have been reported within the past few weeks, which is slightly unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL also reached out to Duke Health and UNC Health
regarding any potential cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Duke Health officials reported they had not seen an increase
in cases and UNC Health shared they had not seen any cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Holly said she wants to warn other parents to take their
little one’s symptoms seriously and seek medical attention to keep it from
spreading to others. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If you see one bump and it looks like that, go in. It’s
better to be safe than sorry. There’s no such thing as overreacting,” Holly said.
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;SSSS is contagious and can live on surfaces for 24 hours. The
condition can be serious for children, &lt;a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/conditions/staphylococcus-scalded-skin-syndrome#:~:text=SSSS%20is%20not%20a%20common,their%20noses%2C%20without%20getting%20sick."&gt;but
mild cases may be resolved on their own&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Children’s
Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

A new monthly &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2025/07/hpai-report-72.pdf"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), which covers activity in June, said though poultry outbreaks have decreased, with only 15 reported for the month, new outbreaks in wild birds are on the rise, especially in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle, movement of infected cattle and contaminated equipment were thought to play major roles in the spread of the virus. However, outbreaks continued to occur, despite curbs on moving dairy cows among states and stepped-up biosecurity measures on farms, raising ongoing questions and intense scientific investigations into other contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fly sequence stirs new buzz&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Raj Rajnarayanan, MSc, PhD, a computational biologist with the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine at Arkansas State University, noticed that H5N1 sequence samples from a house fly from California in October had been recently uploaded to GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and posted his observations on &lt;a href="https://x.com/RajlabN/status/1945958715544244693"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;. Like the virus spreading in cattle, the virus belonged to the B3.13 subtype of the 2.3.4.4b clade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Detection of avian influenza in house flies shows these insects can mechanically move virus around farms,” Rajnarayanan wrote in a follow-up post. “No evidence they spread H5N1 to people or animals but it’s another reason to step up farm biosecurity!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Coston, a former paramedic who has been chronicling avian flu scientific developments for decades on his news blog &lt;a href="https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/07/h5n1-in-california-return-of-fly.html"&gt;Avian Flu Diary&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href="https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/07/h5n1-in-california-return-of-fly.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday referenced a report from as far back as 2006 from Japan that showed blow flies found in the vicinity of a poultry outbreak could carry the virus and spread it by their feet or body following contact with infected material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we're not talking about classically &lt;em&gt;'infected&lt;/em&gt;' flies, it seems likely that contaminated flies may be one of many contributors to the spread of the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] virus,” he wrote, also pointing to a more recent preprint study that suggested blowflies at a Japanese crane colony could acquire the virus from dead birds or from fecal material of infected birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coston also noted that peridomestic animals such as rodents and “poultry dust” have been suggested as other contributors. “Unless and until we get a better handle on how HPAI is spreading in the wild—and among and between farms—our ability to slow or contain these outbreaks will remain limited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Milk snatching’ among routes of cow mammary gland infection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other developments, a Chinese research team that studied experimental infections involving different inoculation routes and resulting transmission in dairy cattle found that mouth-to-teat transmission may be how the H5N1 virus initially infects mammary glands. The team published its findings earlier this month in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaf262/8180392?login=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Science Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that virus delivered through the nose only replicates in the mouth and respiratory tracts of dairy cattle, but inoculation into the mammary gland replicates only in that mammary gland, suggesting that entry through the teat is the only way the virus can naturally infect mammary glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because some lactating cows “steal milk” through self-nursing or mutual nursing, mouth-to-teat transmission may be the route by which H5N1 initially infects the mammary glands, the team wrote. Calves were also able to transmit the virus through nursing. Investigators noted that bovine oral tissues contain high levels of sialic acid receptors, which may facilitate viral infections through contaminated feed and water and efficient replication that can last for several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other experiments, researchers tested two vaccines in lactating cattle, H5 inactivated vaccine and hemagglutinin-based DNA vaccine. They found that both conferred complete protection against H5N1, even after high-dose virus challenge through direct mammary gland inoculation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Prolonged sitting isn’t just bad for your heart; it could also shrink your brain. This effect cannot be compensated for, even if you work out regularly. Yes, that’s right. A recent study found that sedentary behavior is linked with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline despite engaging in physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh found that increased sedentary behavior (time spent sitting or lying down) significantly increases the risk of brain shrinkage, related to risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, especially among older adults. The findings are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12070248/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Link between brain shrinkage and prolonged sitting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is known that prolonged sitting increases the risk of chronic diseases, musculoskeletal problems, and even premature death. But this new study has found that it could also lead to cognitive decline. The researchers found that despite regular physical activity, older adults who spend more time sedentary show greater signs of cognitive decline and brain atrophy over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe prolonged sitting can affect brain health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggests that sedentary behaviour may be an independent risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that already affects millions of people across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 404 adults aged 50 and older for over a seven-year period to undestand the effects of sedentary behavior on cognitive health. The participants were asked to wear activity-monitoring devices for one week to track how much time they spent sitting or lying down. Their sedentary time was then related to their cognitive performance and brain scans captured over a seven-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who spent more time sedentary were more likely to experience cognitive decline and neurodegenerative changes, regardless of how much they exercised. This was prominent in participants who carried the APOE-e4 allele, a genetic risk factor for &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/alzheimers-disease-causes-early-symptoms-and-11-lifestyle-changes-that-could-help-prevent-it/articleshow/122627015.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. This stresses that reducing sedentary time may be especially important for older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is not just about working out once a day. Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease,” lead author Marissa Gogniat, PhD, assistant professor of Neurology at Pitt and former postdoctoral fellow at the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sitting for prolonged hours at work: Beware of these side affects!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age. Our study showed that reducing sitting time could be a promising strategy for preventing neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive decline. This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time,” co-author Angela Jefferson, PhD, professor of Neurology and founding director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center at VUMC, added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxPc2R2Q1RYNERKYkFnVk1tc2Z0WjhuZ0ZXejFaSnZYREpicEpMS3BSb0twWXlJYVh3eFRMdWFXYXBMaXR4TGk1Nk9vVGpSUWJSV0VoWEMteVVWa1VCUUlLVVg4Sjh3UUUydV9TNm5GLUdlU0ltOFgxc2tXQXliWWdkMUxNeWZlNF9hbHBjNW5wQlhCUlpHVG1TdmZIaV90WXNkTUlLYW0zM05HS1BNcFB5QlMzVHdKeDVQQ2ZrZFA0SUptRzkzZ09uWHFKa1lIaFYyU3JCOXlGdFRBS0h3SThNYlhBdUVDdFRJdlMwQWpaNDFDNTBaWmhRYTVRQm9mOV9PVXlCU3h0SFVELVJ6azVfN2Jfb0VBLUJ6Zkx6b0JMdFlSUQ</guid></item><item><title>人们正在分享他们最大的“等等，什么？” ”关于女性健康的启示- BuzzFeed | People Are Sharing Their Biggest “Wait, What?” Revelations About Women’s Health - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5MMkdMWHlzdURZR2hnNWlGSlB4T09QcGt1YU5tcUJQUmZ0eklJdm5jNldvZkt3Z05WeWJJN3RWOTVwZC1Qbk9kSklxek1SSEhyZVZIUW9xcEJoSkZ5dVhBQ2g3N2t6UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

limiting demise awaiting her, Bray made the conscious and voluntary decision to stop eating and drinking to hasten the end of her life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In recent years, Bray had become an advocate for medically assisted euthanasia, saying that had a bill been in place, it would have saved her family from suffering as they watched her deteriorate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only last month, lawmakers in England &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;voted in favor of the “Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life)” law, which would legalize the procedure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As per &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the bill “now proceeds to Britain’s upper chamber, the House of Lords, where it will undergo months of scrutiny.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;VSED is not the same as medically assisted euthanasia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p

U.K. said was important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During an interview with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Aly Dickinson, who runs the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘Living well and dying well South West’ group, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;explained that “VSED is a legal, self-directed decision to stop eating and drinking, leading to a natural d*ath,” and that it doesn’t involve “medical professionals actively ending life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson, an end of life doula in the U.K., said with VSED the only thing medical professionals provide is comfort and care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explained that planning is key when it comes to the decision to participate in VSED.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Things like: “choosing the place of d*ath (typically at home, or in a hospice if the hospice is willing to support VSED, “ as well as writing an end of life plan that includes a statement of Advance Refused Treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block"

data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson said that when it comes to who should consider VSED, there are two main groups of people: “Those experiencing unacceptable suffering, or those seeking to pre-empt the final stage of d*ing, in order to avoid future suffering or a loss of dignity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson said VSED could also be suitable for those “diagnosed with early-stage dementia who retain mental capacity and wish to avoid a prolonged decline.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other possible candidates include people “living with a progressive terminal illness who have decision-making capacity,” or those “facing significant loss of independence due to frailty and chronic health issues, but who still have mental capacity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Dickinson stressed that more needs to be done to educate the public about VSED. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Stories like Emma Bray’s—shared so generously—helps bring much-needed visibility to this deeply personal choice,” she told Bored Panda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Canada, instances of misusing MAiD were investigated by the UN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media"

the Netherlands and Switzerland as other countries where the service is permitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Canada, the option is called MAiD, which stands for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medical Assistance in D*ing, and is performed by a qualified medical practitioner “to provide a person with assistance to end their life, provided they meet specific eligibility criteria.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The procedure became legal in 2016 and has been a hot button issue in the country ever since, with some people saying it’s administered too flippantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="3-687961db3e14d__700"

a coffin-like device which fills with nitrogen to bring an end of life to users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first instance of someone using the device was last September in the forests of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schaffhausen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Switzerland, when an American woman who was reportedly terminally ill chose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/euthanasia-pod-woman-switzerland-investigation-strangulation-marks/" class=" staff-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to end her life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although medically assisted euthanasia is legal in Switzerland, the Sarco pod is not, partly due to the fact that the “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;use of nitrogen in the capsule also contravened with the Chemicals Act.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only person to witness the woman using the pod was 47-year-old Dr. Florian Willet, the co-president and founder of The Last Resort, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an assisted euthanasia organization that promotes the pod.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container

He was never charged, and was later cleared and released.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the trauma of being detained and suspected of strangulation led to an ironic twist in the story, with Willet taking his own life by assisted euthanasia in early June of this year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grlqv76pno" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the pod’s inventor, Philip Nitschke, said that his friend Florian Willet had endured too much psychological trauma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the final months of his life, Dr. Florian Willet shouldered more than any man should,” Nitschke told the BBC, saying that Willet’s arrest had left him “broken.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The BBC says Willet used medically assisted euthanasia administered in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are six countries in Europe with some form of legalized assisted euthanasia including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, and starting later this year, Austria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netizens remain divided over the topic of medically assisted euthanasia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:14:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVG8zUnd2UlIyVXlhU29uZmhjdEY0Z2lZYTFXTHRkejZWRmI0Nl9mRlB3VXE5TVRuSkJrdlB0TktWTlhvdlRteDQxaUx6SHRHRmd0QTg0VDFKaHVfaVlpX1JvOFRuZllfLWNzOHFOekVEZlBsM3Q5c2cyQ3BhUng4NjJCU3N3d00tdlhINjlCYUUtOW8tZ29ENjNIWFdXVEVQV1ZzVkhBZUNuX05ubEMtSWZNcjBLVmFoeWc</guid></item><item><title>癫痫患者威胁对特立尼达和多巴哥Arima医院采取法律行动 | Epileptic patient threatens legal action against Arima Hospital - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQaFZZUVo1d28yeG1aaVlDMkRVTVdfQnNsMUkwN1FqNGN0VXFnUGZqak45ZjhDTmtDLUJLanMtUGRwSlA3VmlqcjVEbkFzSmxuaEpOa3pkR1pELUR0QllxS2dJa3BLcUNndF9yVWpkangwM2dfdXNLbkNfR2pvRXpaZ3ZLV0NaSXhJUjgxZC0zNFh6VHhIcDN0NGVRZ2todw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14094834-1024x683.jpg" alt="Arima General Hospital "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Arima General Hospital &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shaquille Edwards, a 30-year-old father of one, is considering legal action after what he describes as medical negligence at the Arima District Hospital which left him with limited use of his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, Edwards has been living with epilepsy, enduring increasingly frequent seizures, from every three months to nearly every month. On June 21, he was taken to the Arima Hospital during a seizure episode and was later transferred to the Mt Hope Hospital on June 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Edwards, while he was in the throes of a seizure, trainee nurses at Arima attempted to insert an IV line, allegedly causing severe trauma to his wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four days later, he was finally treated for the injury. When Newsday visited him at his Arima home on July 16. His left wrist was visibly bandaged and swollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to Edwards' claims, Health Minister Lackram Bodoe, in a brief WhatsApp message on July 17, said, "The ministry has asked the relevant regional health authority to investigate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsday also spoke to the CEO of the North Central Regional Health Authority Davlin Thomas, the same day, who was not aware of the claim but confirmed an investigation has been ordered.&lt;br&gt;
Recalling the day of the incident, Edwards said, "Honestly, it was all a blur. I was having a seizure when I got there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he was discharged, the hand was swollen, numb, and painful. Later, medical staff told Edwards it was an IV burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't move my hand as before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards, who operates a fruit stall to support himself and his daughter, says it has become difficult to pick fruit and do other basic chores as well as play with his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This hand is my livelihood. Without it, I can’t lift or move produce. It's not just painful – it’s taken away part of my income."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother, Lesley-Ann Mark, who was with him during the hospital visit, shared her concern. She and the family had visited the hospital many times before and when they got there, she suggested to staff they should put in the IV before the seizure got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they waited, and she alleges when it did get worse, trainee nurses were allowed to insert the IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They took him to the back, and I didn’t know what happened after that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark said they had initially been hesitant to speak out, fearing victimisation during future visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had good experiences with some staff, don’t get me wrong,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But people come to the hospital already in pain and distress. A little more empathy would go a long way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards says his experience reflects deeper systemic issues in the healthcare system. Despite being enrolled in the epileptic clinic, he claims he has never been seen by a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve asked for a proper assessment for years. They keep postponing appointments, and there’s no follow-up care after I’m discharged. They just give instructions and send you off.”&lt;br&gt;
Medication availability has also been inconsistent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They switch my epilepsy meds all the time, first Epilim, then something else, and then something new again. It feels like I’m being experimented on. And every time they change it, my body reacts. Sometimes I end up right back in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos shared with Newsday show swelling and discolouration in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said the injury was only treated properly weeks later by a doctor who acted immediately after seeing the condition of the wound. “She didn’t even wait for wound care day, she just dressed it right away. That’s how bad it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also alleged despite being told he would be admitted for observation, he was removed from the ward and placed back in the emergency area to sit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t choose to leave. They just didn’t keep me. And now I’m left with the aftermath.”&lt;br&gt;
Edwards says his family is now seriously exploring legal options. “It’s not just about my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239666137-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about years of poor treatment, neglect, and being ignored. All we’ve asked for is decent care and a chance to heal properly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he is prepared to share all medical documentation, photos, and evidence to support his case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not trying to start trouble. We just want justice, and a system that listens and cares.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

It found evidence that an infant’s birth sex is associated with maternal age and specific genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCXW6DS4Y5CGZC4XDO6WXSWIZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings challenge assumptions that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/16/two-sexes-trump-executive-order-gender-science/" target="_blank"&gt;birth sex&lt;/a&gt; is random. They mirror the results of similar studies in Europe that have also found that birth sex does not follow a simple 50-50 distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BA7QPHWAANAK3JLIYNVXNYADVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists have long documented a global imbalance in which &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/19/see-where-women-outnumber-men-around-the-world-and-why/" target="_blank"&gt;slightly more boys&lt;/a&gt; are born than girls.

Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from more than 146,000 pregnancies from 58,000 nurses in the United States between 1956 and 2015. They found that some families were more likely to have children of the same sex than would be expected if each baby had an equal chance of being a boy or a girl. Moms with three or more kids were more likely to have all boys or all girls than expected by chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QX7MUMBMLZHVNP3IIQ23LZVV3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests that sex at birth follows a weighted probability and that biological influences may sway the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/its-a-boy-its-a-girl-for-some-parents-learning-their-babys-sex-is-a-disappointment/2018/12/12/8aef32c0-f8be-11e8-8d64-4e79db33382f_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;sex of the child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2G7Y4RPIVBBJXBR6Y5T452CTKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you’ve had two girls or three girls and you’re trying for a boy, you should know your odds are not 50-50,” said Jorge Chavarro, the study’s senior author. “You’re more likely than not to have another girl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AUN7PYD2PREOPB4NNYL4YIE57I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers estimated that families with three girls had a 58 percent chance of having another girl, while families with three boys had a 61 percent chance of having a fourth boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJLGIG7YVRAZ7EFCYO262C3ZKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Maternal age is a key factor. Women who started having children after age 28 were slightly more likely to have only boys or only girls. Chavarro said this could reflect age-related biological changes that influence the survival of the Y chromosome carried by boys, such as increased vaginal acidity. Paternal factors could also play a role because maternal and paternal ages are often closely linked. But the study did not include data on fathers, which was noted as a limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MGJUNFE4ZBEJ7HFO5V7QXZAITE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers also identified two genes associated with giving birth to only boys or only girls. “We don’t know why these genes would be associated with sex at birth, but they are, and that opens up new questions,” Chavarro, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TOF22PWULVH4FIIDPNUHH4B64E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Iain Mathieson, a professor of genetics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who was not involved in the study, said the genetic associations should be viewed cautiously. He said the study’s genetic analysis was based on a relatively small sample and may be influenced by other factors, making the results more speculative until confirmed by further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BZUIS64PMJGUBDARJFDY76WFTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t find the genetic factors identified here particularly convincing,” Mathieson said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4ZRFJORWN5H2POSUCWTZ6DQFQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers also found that parents were more likely to have one boy and one girl than would be expected by chance, a pattern they believe reflects a tendency to stop having children once both sexes are represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YX6XXSCPEJEDVHLZBCOX5KLJWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To reduce bias from such family planning decisions, they analyzed data after removing each woman’s final child. They also excluded women who had experienced miscarriages or stillbirths to test whether pregnancy loss changed the results. They still found the same pattern: The odds of birth sex did not follow mere chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWJJ65PXBJFBBCJ53DZSX5AH6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests it may not have been so improbable for the fictional parents in the TV sitcom “Malcolm in the Middle” to have five sons or for the Bennet family in “Pride and Prejudice” to have five daughters. Even in history, patterns like this have drawn attention. King Louis VII of France, for example, remarried after his first two wives each gave birth to daughters, depriving him of a male heir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DO6FWXSB5ABBAZ53UXEW53YCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chavarro said it might take years to fully understand why some families consistently have children of one sex, but this research is an important place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NMMQB2EFAZG3LDKZE5PMHHARSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His team said future studies should explore how lifestyle, nutrition and exposure to environmental chemicals might affect these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKJJADTPKNB4JMPZRGGMDLUACE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Certain factors such as race, natural hair color, blood type, body mass index and height were not associated with having children of only one sex. But the study sample was 95 percent White and made up entirely of nurses, a group that may have different occupational exposures or health patterns compared with the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NURIM5QGI5B45FJ2UD2PEQUIIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David A. Haig, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University who was not involved in the study, said it offers evidence that the probability of a baby’s sex varies by family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTF3VAYQ6JGWBHPQNVESLKJGWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Different families are flipping different coins with different biases,” Haig said. “It speaks to something very intuitive and personal, even if the underlying biology is complex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:02:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOaUIzSjRCWDVobFlMNHkzRWE1N1hQQXo4TmFROFpVWXpIajc4RXFENGlVUER4WnlCN0w1WHdka05OVWx0Z2g3WXNxZXM4OHdZdVppZnEweHFzUzJtSXdLY3EwT0hOVWxMaUFHUDd1UE1hS1F6U3ZSc1dXeEowRm1Hbw</guid></item><item><title>狗在症状开始前几年通过嗅觉检测到帕金森氏症- NewsNation | Dogs detect Parkinson’s by smell, years before symptoms start - NewsNation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE94VEg5dG1xQ1RZaUpfeG54Z3NfekpXNXVXQXdValh6MEkzR055WTVyTnZwNkMxaks4Y3NveFFrREFyVHp4ck82bEI3dDFTazN3MFNLakFtVkc1Y29NXzFwTk9PYTFrRVlNNUZNdHVvN2NjdElGN0kyd0QyM0hLTlnSAYQBQVVfeXFMTm1zeWhwWGFvTGowdTcwbGpmQkdMNDBvejNLNmlVRVRpUGkyZTFiODE3TmhlY1lUXzIwbFprcU15Uk1VOGs1Yy1RdXBQeXpTSHVEWVUyUS1yYWdHblJNa1AxRGIwcU4wSkRleVpLYWF6d09fYjVNMXRxdTZ4WGFtSkl0V2J6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb, high-fat diet often used for weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study suggests the keto diet may increase the risk of all cancers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following an anti-inflammatory diet may help reduce the risk of cancer by lowering inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease still holds the top spot for causes of death in the U.S., but cancer isn’t far behind, with each condition claiming the lives of over 600,000 Americans every year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And while researchers are more certain about how to prevent heart disease through lifestyle changes, cancer remains a bit more elusive. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists are continually searching for ways to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent cancer&lt;/a&gt; and increase survival rates for those with the disease. Researchers from China analyzed data from a long-running U.S. survey called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 2001 and 2018. They wanted to know what association, if any, exists between a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289764/should-you-follow-the-ketogenic-diet/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt; and cancer. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition and Cancer&lt;/em&gt;—let’s break down what they found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this analysis, almost 44,000 participants from the NHANES met the researchers’ criteria. The participants were fairly evenly split between genders, but did skew slightly more female. Participants were at least 20 years of age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All the data were self-reported, including history of cancer, dietary information and demographics. To determine if a participant had a history of cancer, they answered yes or no to the question, “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had cancer or a malignancy of any kind?” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary intake was calculated using the average of two 24-hour dietary recalls, which researchers used to calculate each participant’s dietary ketogenic ratio (DKR). The DKR is a calculation that indicates the likelihood of someone entering ketosis based on their macronutrient ratio. Ketosis occurs when carbohydrates, the body’s preferred source of energy, are not available. In this case, the body turns to fat as an energy source, and then the liver converts fat into ketone bodies, which can also be used as an energy source. Based on their DKRs, participants were placed into one of four quartiles, with Q4 having the highest DKRs and Q1 having the lowest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Demographics that would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included age, sex, ethnicity, income and education levels, marital status, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;, smoking status and medical history. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers found that as DKR increased, so did the risk of cancer. But not just one or two types of cancer—all cancers. In other words, they found a significant association between the keto diet and the risk of developing cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these study authors note that there are likely some short-term benefits of a keto diet, the long-term risks may outweigh the benefits. Why keto may raise cancer risk needs to be explored further, but researchers provide a few possible explanations. First, they note that ketones have been implicated in increasing oxidative stress, causing cellular damage, which increases the risk of developing cancer. They also point out that while cancer cells typically prefer to use glucose as an energy source, research suggests that some cancer cells can utilize ketones as an alternative energy source to survive and proliferate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to these findings, these researchers also found that as the degree of ketosis increased, there was a notable decline in the antioxidant properties of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as trace elements such as manganese, zinc, and selenium. This aligns with numerous studies that have consistently shown deficiencies in antioxidant vitamins and trace elements can substantially increase the risk of all cancers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One significant limitation of this study is that participants’ ketosis levels were not directly measured with bloodwork. Also, information was all self-reported, which leaves room for error and bias. This includes cancer diagnoses, which might have been more accurate had they used participants’ medical records. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While a ketogenic diet does have some legitimate medical uses—like reducing seizures in children with epilepsy—beyond that, it’s mainly used to lose weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The problem is following it long-term—let’s face it, one can only eat so much cheese and bacon. And while all foods can fit into a healthy eating pattern, it’s important to eat a variety of foods to ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs. Though this study can’t say that a keto diet causes cancer, based on this data, there appears to be a strong connection between the two, and more research should be done. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since we know there’s also a correlation between chronic inflammation and cancer, eating an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-an-anti-inflammatory-diet-8764103" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce cancer risk. An anti-inflammatory diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides eating a varied, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight, the American Cancer Society recommends engaging in regular physical activity, managing your stressors, getting plenty of quality sleep, avoiding or limiting alcohol and not smoking to help lower your cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests a connection between the ketogenic diet and cancer risk. While keto may help you lose weight, the risks may outweigh the benefits. If you feel better reducing carbs, there are healthier and more moderate ways to do so that don’t go to keto extremes. To get started, choose from our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7885079/30-minute-low-carb-high-protein-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-carb, high-protein dinners&lt;/a&gt; that come together in just 30 minutes or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291575/high-protein-low-carb-breakfasts-to-help-you-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein, low-carb breakfasts&lt;/a&gt; to help you lose weight. If cancer prevention is top of mind, taking a holistic approach may not only help prevent cancer but also other diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, lean proteins and healthy fats in your diet. In addition, move your body often, deal with what’s stressing you out, get enough quality sleep and spend time with loved ones.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 17:27:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE15RTQ3RlFCV2NFdjkweWhLN2FhSHJsV1UxS3d4V0J3NWJKenRjUFNRcVJSUTVJT216eWpydEExYzB5N2lhNkZNMmZjeXBKSGtxRVRJZFh4U0h0VU1sU0dXMldVX3YyQmViRFY2NjVocFA1NEQtUU53MTZsLVVKQQ</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府浪费了近80万非洲疫苗：报告- Ars Technica | Trump admin squanders nearly 800,000 vaccines meant for Africa: Report - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNZDdHck1ZNS1qamIwaUVzTDNrQ3p5bllFWFVGdjlUWmduWGU5UXhUQnVXeEdJdDAyRWlhWG5VSU9pZ2l1b0lHRFJ6SFlMM3lmOW44WkQ0c1ZPemdRbFJKSGxJampIeDR3MFZWazhoaHU0ZUI0aXBjTUZfdFo4NE5pa2RXdTVISkJBRFB6VTdoYzBLQ0xnbURJTWoyMUdMczBBU21SODk2VFNWWmhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Nearly 800,000 doses of mpox vaccine pledged to African countries working to stamp out devastating outbreaks are headed for the waste bin because they weren't shipped in time, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/17/us-has-wasted-hundreds-of-thousands-of-vaccines-meant-for-africa-health-officials-there-say-00460290?utm_campaign=KHN:+First+Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--eszRHhuI8X2faI-mZVE2luzzBgtK1oFhRnCmThGQYTOQfpxJ6mH-8hqkNJJl3U2D6dRENrJ8VXScM47-IJLTksbKauA&amp;amp;_hsmi=371897914&amp;amp;utm_content=371897914&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;according to reporting by Politico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearly 800,000 doses were part of a donation promised under the Biden administration, which was meant to deliver more than 1 million doses. Overall, the US, the European Union, and Japan pledged to collectively provide 5 million doses to nearly a dozen African countries. The US has only sent 91,000 doses so far, and only 220,000 currently still have enough shelf life to make it. The rest are expiring within six months, making them ineligible for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For a vaccine to be shipped to a country, we need a minimum of six months before expiration to ensure that the vaccine can arrive in good condition and also allow the country to implement the vaccination," Yap Boum, an Africa CDC deputy incident manager, told Politico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politico linked the vaccines' lack of timely shipment to the Trump administration's brutal cuts to foreign aid programs as well as the annihilation of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which administered those aid programs.&lt;/p&gt;

So I’ve never been super into her, until the most recent episode of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/just-season-3-starts-twist-124527827.html" data-ylk="slk:And Just Like That;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;And Just Like That&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. In season 3, episode 8, she has an unexpected attack of vertigo, an illness that’s played for laughs but is no joke, evidenced by the polarized comments about it online. As a vertigo alum myself, I've done a deep dive into the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Near the top of the episode, Charlotte is at her gallery, assembling a mattress installation clearly inspired by Tracy Emin’s seminal work &lt;em&gt;My Bed&lt;/em&gt;, when she bends over and moans softly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Kai, may I have your hand? I think my vertigo is back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I didn’t think vertigo is real?” the gallery worker responds. “You know, like Epstein-Barr.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Oh, it’s a real thing,” Charlotte nods, woozily. “I had it last year, I had to take to my bed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Charlotte’s condition subsides, then recurs during a long set piece at the gallery, in which Charlotte pratfalls while rushing across the room. Again, when Charlotte explains that she fell due to vertigo, another character looks her dismissively and says “Is that even a real thing?” Later that same evening, Charlotte is shown entering her home alone, still bent over from the condition, trying to talk to Lisa on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Craig Blankenhorn/HBO Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Granted, vertigo isn’t as serious as Charlotte’s husband’s prostate cancer or Miranda’s alcoholism, but online banter calls out the show for its misinformation and insensitivity. In &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/and-just-like-that-recap-season-3-episode-8-happily-ever-after.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vulture’s comment section;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Vulture’s comment section&lt;/a&gt;, for example, Mediaqueen1985 says she has vertigo, then criticizes the depiction: “Ugh. More Charlotte as Lucy Ricardo but with vertigo as an excuse. Vertigo usually involves heights, so WTH?” Next, an ear-nose and throat specialist writes “vertigo isn’t a fear of heights, but a room-spinning sensation. Charlotte likely had BPPV, although the depiction was a little…off.” Johnandtara chimes in: “Nurse here—and I have a few friends in menopause experiencing vertigo, so I think they are throwing it into the mix as a women of a certain age thing.” And finally Nnfowlds opines: “They sent Charlotte home on her own in a vertigo state? Goofy and irritating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reality check—according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21769-vertigo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, “vertigo causes dizziness and makes you feel like you’re spinning when you’re not. It most commonly occurs when there’s an issue with your inner ear. But you can also develop it if you have a condition affecting your brain, like a tumor or stroke. Treatments vary and can include medication, repositioning maneuvers or surgery.” It may or may not involve heights. There are two main types, peripheral and central; peripheral is the common sort. A decade-long &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4110114/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 1,000 women showed that one type of peripheral, BBPV (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), is increasingly common in perimenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Watching the show, I was perplexed by the lack of sympathy given to Charlotte when she's incapacitated, since I have had stress-induced bouts of the condition. Initially, I woke up with the room spinning so profoundly, alone and frightened, that I speed-dialed a friend to come take me to the emergency room. (My condition was diagnosed and I was given anti-nausea medication.) After subsequent attacks, an ENT taught me the Epley Maneuver, a head movement exercise designed to reposition the ear crystals that cause BBPV. It’s a recurring condition for me, in the manner of commenter Itcouldbeworse: “I had it for months, but only when I got up from bed too quickly (luckily.) The room would spin. Even after it stopped happening, I got up very slowly for a long while, in case it had come back. (The first time it had happened, there was no warning.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here's the rub: Never once did anyone suggest that I might be fantasizing my illness, or doubting that the condition even exists. Nor would anyone have sent me home, unaccompanied, if I couldn’t walk straight. Charlotte deserves better—the poor woman is just regaining her footing, so to speak. She's just been through a recent major health scare with her husband, a massive career responsibility and caretaking a heartbroken daughter and teetotaling friend!

These factors damage the cells that keep your cornea clear, and they don’t grow back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, the team found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine caused a patient's cornea to go from 528 to 542 micrometers in thickness, or roughly 0.0208 inches to 0.0213 inches. This is a roughly two-percent increase in micrometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A slightly thicker cornea isn't automatically harmful. The cornea can thicken temporarily due to inflammation, fluid buildup, or stress on the endothelium from minor illnesses or injuries to the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it stays too thick for months or years, however, it could make the cornea less clear, potentially affecting vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team did not recommend against vaccination and will still need to conduct long-term testing on patients to see if these changes continue to appear months and years after taking the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (pictured) has also been tied to rare inflammatory heart conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average number of endothelial cells, which keep the cornea clear by pumping out excess fluid, dropped from 2,597 to 2,378 cells per square millimeter in the study, a loss of about eight percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normal endothelial cell counts range from 2,000 to 3,000 cells per square millimeter in healthy adults, so 2,378 is still within a safe range for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for someone with a low cell count to start with, due to a previous eye surgery, infection, or disease, this loss could be riskier for their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also discovered that these cells became less uniform after the vaccination, with their coefficient of variation - each cell's difference in size - increasing from 39 to 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cells die, nearby cells stretch to fill the gaps, leading to bigger differences in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could mean the endothelium is less healthy. If this trend continued for years, it could affect the cornea’s clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After vaccination, the study found fewer cells kept their healthy six-sided shape, with the total dropping from 50 to 48 percent of the cells in the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Healthy endothelial cells are usually shaped like hexagons, which allows them to fit together tightly, like a honeycomb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the two-percent drop was not a direct sign of damage, it suggested to the team that the cells might be reacting to some sort of stress over those two months to three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers said their results also showed evidence that the changes had a high likelihood of being directly linked to taking the vaccine, meaning it wasn't just a random anomaly in the testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the signs of stress and inflammation drop off shortly after receiving the Pfizer shot, the impact of these minor changes would not be overly harmful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A woman undergoes an eye exam. Scientists have found multiple signs of stress in the eye after taking the Pfizer COVID-19 shot (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To find these results, the team studied 128 eyes, 64 pairs in total, before each person received their COVID vaccinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They followed up with the group approximately 75 days after they got their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team used a machine called Sirius corneal topography to measure the corneas' thickness and shape, and another device, the Tomey EM-4000 specular microscope, to take detailed pictures of the endothelial cells to check their number, size and shape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each participant also took a full eye exam, including tests for vision sharpness, eye pressure and scans of the eye’s front and back parts to ensure overall eye health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By comparing the measurements taken before vaccination to those after, the researchers could see if the Pfizer vaccine was influencing the health of the eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new data on potentially harmful side-effects linked to Pfizer's COVID vaccine added to a growing list of concerns the Trump Administration has highlighted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In May, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forced Pfizer and Moderna to use &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14739333/trump-fda-covid-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-heart-damage.html"&gt;expanded warning labels&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of heart damage tied to COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots previously included warning labels about the rare chance of patients suffering myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the sac-like lining surrounding the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new labels expanded that warning to certain age groups, particularly men between the ages of 16 and 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that this seemingly healthy group appeared to be at the highest risk of the rare complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Once a week, the group dresses in neon leggings and acid-washed denim to “&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/power-walking-exercise-rcna19052" target="_blank"&gt;power walk&lt;/a&gt;” a 3.5-loop around the Lloyd Center in Portland. While the point is fitness, mall walkers love the lively chatter, ample rest stations and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/dietitian-tip-carbs-protein-muscle-recovery-rcna207356" target="_blank"&gt;post-workout snacks&lt;/a&gt;, like Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and bubble tea.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11ce8c" class="body-graf"&gt;Catwood admits she used to giggle at mall walkers when she worked in a mall. Now, she admires them — along with the electrifying fashion that enriched the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a42c0b" class="body-graf"&gt;As a self-professed “female Richards Simmons,” Catwood leads the pack wearing her blonde ponytail in a scrunchie, metallic fuchsia lipstick, a bright tracksuit and a fanny pack. Bringing up the caboose is Catwood’s sister Melissa Dickerson, who carries speakers blasting music by Paula Abdul, C+C Music Factory and Prince. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-daf4b5"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg" alt="Krista Catwood leads a 1980s-inspired weekly walking group called “Food Court 5000.”"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Krista Catwood leads a 1980s-inspired weekly walking group called “Food Court 5000.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Amoxtli Reyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-316475" class="body-heading"&gt;The Unique Benefits of Mall Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-77a1b6" class="body-graf"&gt;The benefits of a walking routine are well documented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d343a6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Walking is a low-impact exercise that offers a wide range of benefits for people of all ages and fitness levels,” Stephanie Mansour, a certified personal trainer and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/fitness" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY Fitness &lt;/a&gt;contributor, tells TODAY.com. She adds that walking can help you "maintain a healthy weight by burning calories and boosting metabolism while also strengthening the bones and muscles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-715cd1" class="body-graf"&gt;Plus, she says, “It strengthens the heart and reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ca43" class="body-graf"&gt;According to Mansour, walking also improves balance and coordination, helping to prevent falls and injuries, and improves mental health. “Walking has a positive impact on mental and emotional well-being as it reduces stress, anxiety and depression by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood boosters,” says Mansour. “Walking also improves cognitive function, enhancing memory and concentration. It provides an opportunity to clear your head, and gain a sense of calm and relaxation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-0937fa"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg" alt="Krista Catwood (R) and her group of mall-walkers called “Food Court 5000” wave to shoppers.

Mansour says the environment is a reliable, climate-controlled space “making it accessible year-round, regardless of weather conditions, which can encourage more regular exercise habits.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c35a3" class="body-graf"&gt;The “visual stimulation” of a mall (bright lights, special events, excited children) can make walking feel less “monotonous” than walking on a treadmill, says Mansour.  Stroll by an Orange Julius or Cinnabon stand and you time-travel back to the good ‘ole days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8c403" class="body-graf"&gt;“Emotionally, mall walking can tap into feelings of nostalgia and comfort, as many people associate malls with positive memories of social interactions and leisure activities of years past,” explains Mansour. “Mentally, mall walking provides an opportunity to connect with others, combatting feelings of loneliness and isolation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-b2f386"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg" alt="Members of “Food Court 5000,” a mall-walking group, stretch it out at the Lloyd Center in Portland, Oregon.

I needed to work movement into my life that was fun, free or cheap, and didn’t feel like a chore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-470655" class="body-graf"&gt;And so “Food Court 5000” was born. The group welcomes anyone who vibes. “We are a friendly, joyous, blur of neon, waving at kids, shop owners, security guards,” says Catwood. “Everyone knows us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b86259" class="body-graf"&gt;Not only does it provide a fun, social environment, but a dose of motivation and accountability, too. “You have to &lt;em&gt;look &lt;/em&gt;like a mall walker by pumping your arms in a power walk,” says Catwood. “Otherwise you’re just walking in the mall — you’re not mall walking.” Catwood often yells into her mic, “Get those arms moving! You can do it!” If someone slows down, a buddy pauses to walk alongside them. The group’s mantra: There is no shaming at 'Food Court 500.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-d18a08"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg" alt="Leslie Kelinson (L) and Krista Catwood (R) lead the way in their walking group “Food Court 5000” at the Lloyd Center in Portland, Oregon.

              &lt;p&gt;Young people appear to be increasingly vulnerable to gastrointestinal cancers, but researchers aren’t entirely sure what is driving the surge in disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a new study out this week, scientists led by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute found that rates of early-onset GI cancers—those occurring in people younger than 50—are rising more rapidly than other types of cancer. In particular, colorectal cancer cases have significantly increased, while rates of other forms of the disease, like stomach cancer, are creeping up, too. While the paper doesn’t come to definitive conclusions as to why these conditions are becoming more common, the researchers point to risk factors like obesity, a poor diet, and sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Colorectal cancer is the most common early-onset GI cancer worldwide, accounting for more than half of the cases, but it is not the only GI cancer that is rising in younger adults,” said senior study author Kimmie Ng, director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber, in a &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/newsroom/news-releases/2025/global-rise-in-many-early-onset-gi-cancers-detailed-in-two-dana-farber-reviews-with-colorectal-cancer-leading-the-trend"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, pancreatic, gastric, and esophageal cancers are also increasing in young people,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ng and her colleagues reviewed data collected from 100 studies, as well as past scientific reviews, and cancer-related guidelines. They also analyzed three publicly available cancer statistic databases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the incidence of early-onset GI cancers has been increasing globally, they found, but especially in high-income countries like the U.S. Between 2010 and 2019, the age-adjusted incidence rate in the U.S. increased by 2.16% annually—the greatest increase of any early-onset cancer during that time. In 2022, there were at least 25,000 Americans under 50 who developed GI cancer. The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836671"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An earlier, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209?login=false#google_vignette"&gt;separate review of data&lt;/a&gt;—by some of the same authors—over a similar time period concluded that the rate of GI cancer has tripled in young people aged between 15 and 19, and almost doubled in those aged between 20 and 24.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rising incidence of early-onset GI cancers is alarming and underscores the need for enhanced prevention strategies and early detection methods,” said Ng.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As the rates of these cancers have risen, so have some of their risk factors, including rates of obesity and time spent sitting; ultraprocessed foods are also more common now, especially in Western diets. Still, the researchers estimate that as much as 30% of early-onset GI cancer may be linked to genetic mutations. Other scientists have argued that other issues, like &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/scientists-may-have-figured-out-why-young-people-are-getting-colorectal-cancer-more-often-2000594349"&gt;common stomach infections&lt;/a&gt;, could also be driving the increase in cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as the causes remain unclear, what is clear is that more work needs to be done to help catch these cancers early enough, before they become impossible to treat, the researchers said. In 2020, public health experts recommended routine screening for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/45-is-the-new-50-when-it-comes-to-colorectal-cancer-scr-1845499824"&gt;colorectal cancer in people 45&lt;/a&gt; and up, but the researchers noted that a year later, fewer than 20% of people ages 45 to 49 went for a screening. Another outstanding question is whether early-onset GI cancers are different from those caught later in life, and if so, should they be treated differently.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We need to be thinking not only about the risk factors for these diseases but also how to screen, diagnose, and treat young people with these cancers,” said Ng.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A person in Arizona has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/arizona-patient-dies-plague-rcna218251"&gt;died from the plague&lt;/a&gt;, local health officials &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/usa-plague-northern-arizona-resident-dies-from-plague/0105f663-5b94-48ac-8ae9-28a9df9a0090"&gt;reported on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the first such death in this region in 18 years. But it's a stark reminder that this historic disease, though rare nowadays, is not just a disease of the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what actually is "plague"? And is it any cause for concern in Australia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-does-the-plague-keep-coming-back-to-plague-humans?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Why Does The Plague Keep Coming Back to Plague Humans?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There are 3 types of 'plague'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word "plague" is often used to refer to any major disease  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, or even to other undesirable events, such as a mouse plague. Naturally, the word can evoke fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But scientifically speaking, plague is a disease caused by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague"&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague has three main forms: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bubonic is the most common and is named after "&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague"&gt;buboes&lt;/a&gt;", which are the painful, swollen lymph nodes the infection causes. Other symptoms include  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, headache, chills and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bubonic plague is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/causes/index.html"&gt;typically spread by fleas&lt;/a&gt; living on animals such as rats, prairie dogs and marmots. If an infected flea moves from their animal host to bite a human, this can cause an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168387" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168387" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/rat.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-168387" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/rat.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/rat-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/rat-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168387" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Fleas on animals like rats can carry the plague. (Denitsa Kireva/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also become infected through handling an animal infected with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/septicemic-plague"&gt;Septicemic plague&lt;/a&gt; occurs if bubonic plague is left untreated, or it can occur directly if the disease enters the bloodstream. Septicemic plague causes bleeding into the organs. The name comes from septicemia, which refers to a serious blood infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent death in the United States was due to a case of pneumonic plague, which is the most severe form. Bubonic plague can in some cases spread to the lungs, where it becomes pneumonic plague. However, pneumonic plague can also spread from person to person &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague"&gt;via tiny respiratory droplets&lt;/a&gt;, in a similar way to COVID. Symptoms are similar to the other forms but also include severe  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague"&gt;30–60% of people&lt;/a&gt; who contract bubonic plague will die, while the fatality rate can be up to 100% for pneumonic plague if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plague: a potted history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disease is one of the most important in history. The &lt;a href="https://origins.osu.edu/connecting-history/covid-justinianic-plague-lessons"&gt;Plague of Justinian&lt;/a&gt; (541–750CE) killed &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues"&gt;tens of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; in the western Mediterranean, heavily impacting the expansion of the Byzantine Empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medieval Black Death (1346–53) was also seismic, killing &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues"&gt;tens of millions of people&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://origins.osu.edu/connecting-history/covid-black-death-plague-lessons"&gt;up to half of Europe's population&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spread by the growing trade networks of the British empire, the third and most recent plague pandemic spanned the years 1855 until roughly 1960, peaking in the early 1900s. It was responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/historys-seven-deadliest-plagues"&gt;12 million deaths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/the-history-of-plague-part-1-the-three-great-pandemics/"&gt;primarily in India&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/bubonic-plague"&gt;reached Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's believed the bubonic plague was largely behind these pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plague in the modern day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First introduced into the US during the third pandemic, plague infects an average of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html"&gt;seven people a year&lt;/a&gt; in the west of the country, due to being endemic in groundhog and prairie dog populations there. The last major outbreak was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html"&gt;100 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths are very rare, with &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240220-bubonic-plague-did-the-black-death-rewire-our-immune-system"&gt;14 deaths in the past 25 years&lt;/a&gt; in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html"&gt;a few thousand cases&lt;/a&gt; of plague over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/health-topics/plague/plague-map-2016.png?sfvrsn=68bcc3ee_10"&gt;countries with the most cases currently&lt;/a&gt; include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Peru, with cases also occurring in India, central Asia and the US. Cases usually occur in rural and agricultural areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Plague can be treated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague can easily be treated with common antibiotics, typically a course of 10–14 days, which can include both oral and intravenous antibiotics. But it &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/hcp/clinical-care/index.html"&gt;must be treated quickly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent death is concerning, as it involves &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/12/us/pneumonic-plague-arizona-death.html"&gt;the airborne pneumonic form&lt;/a&gt; of the disease, the only form that spreads easily from person to person. But there's no evidence of further spread of the disease within the US at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/em&gt; is not found in Australian animals, there is little risk here. Plague has not been reported in Australia &lt;a href="https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/bubonic-plague"&gt;in more than a century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But plague, like many diseases, is influenced by environmental conditions. The risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="168385" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; causing an expansion in the &lt;a href="https://www.bwfund.org/news/revisiting-the-black-death-for-clues-to-climate-changes-role-in-pandemics/#:%7E:text=The%20Black%20Death%20was%20a,25%20countries%20on%20four%20continents.%E2%80%9D"&gt;habitat of animal hosts&lt;/a&gt; means public health experts around the world should continue to monitor it closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plague, though often perceived as a disease of history, is still with us and can pose a major health threat if not treated early.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261088/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

That’s according to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02857-2" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which analyzed fecal samples from hundreds of individuals and found specific microbial signatures linked to both mental health diagnoses and the use of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trillions of microbes that inhabit the intestine—often called the gut microbiota—help break down food, guide immune activity, and generate chemicals that influence the brain. Over the past decade scientists have linked unusual microbial patterns to a range of mental health problems, raising hopes that diet, probiotics, or other microbe‑directed therapies could complement traditional care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet many previous projects were small, drew volunteers who were not taking medication, or came from countries where treatment routines differ from those in the United States. The new research set out to fill those gaps by analyzing gut organisms in a broad American cohort that included many people who already used pharmaceuticals for mood or anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Past work, including ours, has linked microbes in the gut to anxiety and depression. We wanted to test whether the use of specific medications had the same or different effects on the microbiome, and whether the effects were similar or different in the two conditions,” said study author &lt;a href="https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Rob Knight&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at UC San Diego and director of the Center for Microbiome Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants came from two Oklahoma‑based projects: the Tulsa 1000 study and the Neurocomputational Mechanisms of Affiliation and Personality initiative. Together they provided 666 stool samples—502 from adults diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, or both, and 164 from healthy comparison volunteers. Diagnosis was confirmed in structured clinical interviews, and symptom intensity was recorded with standard questionnaires for anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists also logged every drug each person was using and grouped those medicines with the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system, paying special attention to antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and to anti‑anxiety drugs like benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each stool sample underwent two layers of genetic analysis. First, the team amplified and sequenced a short genetic marker that acts like a barcode for bacteria, giving a precise but affordable snapshot of which species were present. A subset of samples then went through whole‑genome sequencing, a deeper method that captures longer stretches of genetic material and can spot less common organisms. After quality filtering, each participant contributed the best‑sequenced sample to the final data set, ensuring that no one skewed the results by providing multiple specimens of different quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined microbial diversity in several ways. &lt;em&gt;Alpha diversity&lt;/em&gt;, a measure of how many species live in one person’s gut, did not differ between healthy volunteers and those with anxiety, depression, or both. &lt;em&gt;Beta diversity&lt;/em&gt;, which asks how different one person’s total community is from another’s, told a richer story. In statistical models that considered all participants together, antidepressant use produced the strongest separation between microbial communities, exceeding the effect linked to a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti‑anxiety medicines, biological sex, and study cohort also showed measurable associations with beta diversity. When the scientists looked only at people who were not taking psychotropic drugs, sex emerged as the lone significant factor, suggesting that pharmaceuticals were indeed a prime driver of the broader community shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that medications have a larger effect on the composition of the gut microbiome than the conditions that they are used to treat,” Knight told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinpointing individual organisms, the team compared people with anxiety alone, depression alone, both conditions, and healthy controls—but only among volunteers who were not using mood‑altering medicines. Forty‑four bacterial types were more common in anxiety, while fifty tended to be higher in healthy controls. A calculated ratio between anxiety- and control-associated microbes was elevated in participants with anxiety, in those with depression, and especially in those who carried both diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same pattern held for women and showed a weaker trend in men. When that ratio was plotted against anxiety severity scores, higher microbial values tracked with more intense worry, although the correlation was modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar hunt for depression‑linked organisms identified forty‑seven bacteria enriched in depressed participants and sixty‑four enriched in controls. A ratio based on those organisms rose in every diagnostic group compared with healthy volunteers. Again the signal was clearer in women than in men, and the ratio edged upward alongside depression severity on the Patient Health Questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication exerted its own signatures. Comparing people who used anti‑anxiety drugs with unmedicated peers who had anxiety revealed 88 bacterial types tied to the drugs and 77 tied to no medication. Contrasting antidepressant users with unmedicated depressed participants spotlighted 102 drug‑associated organisms and seventy‑three linked to no medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the scientists built ratios from those bacterial sets, the numbers distinguished not only drug users from non‑users but also separated volunteers who took both antidepressants and anti‑anxiety drugs from those on either class alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore whether such microbial fingerprints could aid diagnosis, the team trained a random‑forest machine‑learning model on the bacterial data. Across repeated cross‑validation runs the model consistently identified anxiety, depression, or both with accuracy well above chance, especially when it relied on the organisms flagged in the earlier statistical screens. Performance was strongest in women, echoing the sex differences seen in the diversity analyses. A separate classifier that tried to detect medication use also beat chance, though with lower precision than the diagnosis model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For added confirmation, the researchers tested their depression‑related bacterial ratio in an independent data set from the American Gut Project, selecting more than eight thousand stool samples from adults under fifty‑six. Volunteers who reported a clinician‑diagnosed depression showed higher ratios than those who did not, mirroring the Tulsa findings and hinting that the microbial signal generalizes to other American populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also surprised by how reliable the signatures of medication use were, suggesting that they might be developed into a test that could check for medication adherence through the effects on the microbiome,” Knight explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project highlights several intertwined themes. First, prescriptions meant to treat mood and anxiety symptoms appear to shape the gut ecosystem at least as much as the psychiatric conditions themselves. Second, despite that pharmaceutical influence, certain bacteria still line up with anxiety, depression, or combined symptoms, and their relative abundance drifts upward as self‑reported distress intensifies. Finally, microbial profiles alone carry enough information to allow an algorithm to flag who is likely living with a mood or anxiety disorder, raising the prospect of stool‑based screening tools down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Specific microbes are associated with anxiety and depression, suggesting that addressing these conditions may involve different strategies to target these different microbes as part of the overall therapeutic strategy,” Knight said. “Medications that target anxiety and depression affect many gut microbes including these, although future studies are needed to determine how much of therapeutic effectiveness comes from these effects on microbes rather than effects on the human body and brain directly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the study also carries caveats. It tracked associations rather than assigning treatments or manipulating microbes, so it cannot reveal which changes come first—the microbial shifts, the mental‑health symptoms, or the remedies. Dosage information was not dissected, and smaller sample sizes in the deeper whole‑genome sequencing limited some comparisons. The healthy control group also contained fewer men than women, which might have exaggerated sex differences. Future projects will need larger, balanced cohorts, repeated sampling over time, and experiments that intervene in diet, microbial composition, or medication schedules to tease apart cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigators plan to probe those questions by coupling longitudinal human follow‑ups with animal studies that transfer specific bacteria into germ‑free mice. If particular microbes can blunt anxious or depressed behavior in animals, that will strengthen the case that they contribute to mental‑health resilience rather than merely reflecting it. Clinical trials could then test whether targeted probiotics, fiber‑rich diets that foster beneficial species, or even tailored antibiotic courses improve mood or enhance the response to standard drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02857-2" target="_blank"&gt;Medication use is associated with distinct microbial features in anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Amanda Hazel Dilmore, Rayus Kuplicki, Daniel McDonald, Megha Kumar, Mehrbod Estaki, Nicholas Youngblut, Alexander Tyakht, Gail Ackermann, Colette Blach, Siamak MahmoudianDehkordi, Boadie W.

The researchers specifically looked at scores for &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Life's Essential 8;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Life's Essential 8&lt;/a&gt;, a health assessment tool created by the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After crunching the data, the researchers found that four components in Life’s Essential 8 (blood glucose, blood pressure, sleep quality, and nicotine use) were the most important factors in predicting participants’ future risk of developing cardiovascular disease. But sleep ended up being the biggest predictor of having a cardiovascular disease event and dying from any cause. And those who had better sleep quality had a lower risk of both of these outcomes. “Midlife sleep quality may uniquely contribute to future event risk,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is sleep related to heart health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few potential factors at play here. “Poor sleep can lead to inflammation in the body,” says Jennifer Wider, MD, women’s health expert and co-host of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fid%2Fpodcast%2Fopen-wider-w-kenny-zimlinghaus%2Fid1100528546&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep-energy%2Fa65382034%2Fsleep-heart-health-menopause-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Open Wider podcast;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open Wider&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-023-42758-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep-energy%2Fa65382034%2Fsleep-heart-health-menopause-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that even relatively mild sleep problems can cause inflammation in cells that line the veins in the heart, which could significantly contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there can be an indirect impact of sleep on heart health, too. “Lack of sleep may promote poor eating habits which over time can contribute to poor nutrition, diabetes, and heart disease,” Dr. Wider says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent lack of sleep is also linked to high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attack and stroke, poor blood sugar control, and obesity, points out &lt;a href="https://www.wchriswinter.com/about.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:W.

Estrogen is protective of the heart, she explains. As it drops in the body, a woman’s risk of developing cardiovascular conditions, including heart disease, increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleep disturbances are common during the transition," El Khoudary says. "These issues, worsened by hormonal changes, vasomotor symptoms, and other factors, can increase with age and are linked to higher cardiovascular risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopausal women also tend to see a "sharp increased risk" for sleep apnea, which usually leads to worse sleep and a higher risk of heart issues, Dr. Winter says. But Dr. Winter stresses that women shouldn't assume they’re doomed to have poor sleep—and potentially developing cardiovascular disease as a result—during menopause. “This is such a positive place for menopausal women to focus, because it is a variable that can be measured and improved upon,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if you're struggling with sleep, it's a good idea to check in with a healthcare provider. Starting a good treatment plan could do more than make you feel well-rested the next day—it may support better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 14:02:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9ZV242ejhuTmVGdFZUNWNBa3YyNzk1VFNBRmVIQVd0MkJCS2h4XzNMakZSU2hGRURTWl9QSS1NRS0weF84dEhzRHVEMjA5SFMtQWJJaXdBLTlBVXJCX2pVZ1VKdVVKNEp4R3N6LVJxa2VpSEw3cjhV</guid></item><item><title>胶原蛋白注射剂和补充剂真的是年轻肌肤的秘诀吗？ -《卫报》 | Are collagen shots and supplements really the secret to youthful skin? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNOW1IVnhUN2s2emFOQnRPQnZMdWxZblhwTlN3VUtjTzlJNUVjQzVYRmkwTng5cG1WUzBMMWJxaVhob216b1hidTVSNE9Wel9KRW5xMGVFbVNLLXpXbGZKVG1lenFnYW5CLWk1SDF4cDE4OGJtNkcyYW5uZUloM2xJRDBzZlF4dnVWOGZ4NEVva3QzTzZ4ZnRtUjVPeVpTaW50T0VxTWxn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;rom high-end aesthetics clinics to the middle aisle of Lidl, collagen is having a moment.

There are various types, each comprising long chains of amino acids that wind together to form strong fibres called fibrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Viewed under an electron microscope, these fibrils form a basket-like mesh in young, healthy skin. But as we age, the amount of collagen declines and its structure becomes more cross-linked and fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In younger skin, the fibres tend to be longer and more flexible, but in older skin, they’re shorter and more rigid, primarily as a result of UV damage,” said Prof John Connelly, who studies skin repair and regeneration at Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Collagen is not the only protein that keeps skin looking youthful. Elastin allows skin to stretch and spring back, while other structural proteins help to organise and stabilise collagen. Long sugar chains known as glycosaminoglycans – including the popular skincare ingredient hyaluronic acid – play a key role in hydrating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the tissue. Like collagen, these components degrade and change with age, contributing to sagging, reduced plumpness and wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet collagen continues to dominate the spotlight. Many skincare products list it as an ingredient but “these proteins are very large, so they don’t easily cross the skin barrier when applied topically”, said &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/tanya-shaw" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Prof Tanya Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation and expert in wound healing at King’s College London. That said, collagen in creams may help draw moisture to the skin’s surface, providing a temporary plumping effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Collagen drinks are the latest plot twist. Their aim is to supply the raw materials for fibroblasts, the skin cells responsible for collagen production. There was also evidence that fragments of extracellular matrix proteins might act as signals, stimulating fibroblasts to produce not just collagen but also elastin and hyaluronic acid, said Dr Jonathan Kentley, a consultant dermatologist at the Montrose clinic in London and Chelsea and Westminster hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most collagen supplements use fragments derived from chicken, fish or pork, which are absorbed through the gut and transported to the skin via the bloodstream. However, many are probably broken down further during digestion and it is unclear whether other&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;dietary proteins would offer similar building blocks, according to Connelly and Shaw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even if some fragments do reach the skin, they would be working in a damaged environment. “If you start to make new collagen, where does it go, and how does it interact with the existing collagen?” said &lt;a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/michael.sherratt" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Mike Sherratt&lt;/a&gt;, a skin mechanics expert at the University of Manchester. Also, “if it gets into the bloodstream, it’s not only going to affect the skin, but presumably other organs and tissues as well”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Animal studies offer some support for collagen supplements: radio-labelled collagen fragments have been shown to reach the skin and boost gene activity linked to collagen production in mice. “Mouse studies have also shown reduced wrinkle formation following UV exposure,” said Kentley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some human trials have also reported improved hydration, elasticity, and fewer wrinkles after consuming fish collagen. But most of these were industry-funded and a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934325002839#sec0015" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 23 studies found that only those receiving funding from companies showed significant effects. Kentley said: “When the studies were separated into high-quality and low-quality studies, the high-quality studies showed no skin benefits. So, these results must be interpreted with extreme caution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What about medical procedures such as NeoGen? It uses high-frequency radio waves to covert nitrogen gas into plasma (ionised gas), which delivers controlled heat to deeper layers of the skin. Animal studies suggest this controlled thermal damage alters collagen structure, causing skin tightening, and promotes the shedding of surface layers, improving tone and texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Small clinical studies on patients have also shown an improvement in skin tone and wrinkling,” said Kentley. “However, as this is a relatively new technology there is relatively little evidence other than a handful of small studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other procedures such as microneedling also induce tiny, controlled injuries to the skin, triggering a wound healing response, while injectable “biostimulators” – such as Sculptra – create a foreign body response that stimulates fibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While all these procedures have some clinical evidence supporting their ability to stimulate new collagen, the quality is variable and no head-to-head trials have pitted these products and procedures against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kentley said: “Given that aesthetic medicine is so highly personalised and each product or procedure will have its own benefits and risks, the best way to know what is right for you is by seeing a qualified physician who is not conflicted by the quest for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In terms of topical treatments, there are decades of evidence to support the use of tretinoin [a prescription-strength retinoid] to boost collagen production and reduce other signs of skin ageing such as pigmentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although celebrity endorsements and dramatic before-and-after pictures can be persuasive, it is also worth remembering that these procedures are not a permanent fix for skin ageing – they require continuing treatments, which can be costly. The most effective long-term strategy to protect and preserve your collagen is to minimise UV exposure from an early age, through consistent use of sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sherratt showed me a photo of him during &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jul/19/britain-heatwave-1976-crisis-summer-heat" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Britain’s 1976 heatwave&lt;/a&gt;, when he was nine. Unlike the proteins inside our cells that are regularly renewed, he said, type I collagen in the dermis had a half-life of about 15 years and elastin was thought to be meant to last a lifetime. “These proteins accumulate damage over time. So, it’s highly likely that some of the extracellular matrix proteins in my face and forearm still carry damage from that 1976 holiday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For those of us who did not faithfully apply sunscreen in our youth, it is worth being realistic about how much even the most advanced treatments can achieve. While they may temporarily firm and smooth the skin, the deeper biological damage has already taken place – and much of it may be irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNOW1IVnhUN2s2emFOQnRPQnZMdWxZblhwTlN3VUtjTzlJNUVjQzVYRmkwTng5cG1WUzBMMWJxaVhob216b1hidTVSNE9Wel9KRW5xMGVFbVNLLXpXbGZKVG1lenFnYW5CLWk1SDF4cDE4OGJtNkcyYW5uZUloM2xJRDBzZlF4dnVWOGZ4NEVva3QzTzZ4ZnRtUjVPeVpTaW50T0VxTWxn</guid></item><item><title>湾区新冠肺炎疫情水平目前高于冬季高峰-伯克利赛德 | Bay Area COVID levels now higher than winter peak - Berkeleyside</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOQVd2aUJoZkxRclBPTUw2bWZtRjJFSHFWNHEweFpZd281NHY5M0tvS0VwaXNlTzFRT3BWNlhYQlNMbzdWZ3hmc2FiTW5VaFhQd0Roa0RZTFB4VUxKSHNOR1QtM3Z4Mm1QUnhFczIxRFRyQjR6WHE4NzZMcGNSUFdBellKeXNjcFFta1FpcjdDOW1vZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it feels like several people you know are complaining of &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11954507/covid-symptoms-after-pride-how-to-find-test"&gt;feeling sick with what they assume is an “awful summer cold” — perhaps with a painful sore throat — &lt;/a&gt;there’s a good chance it could be COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 levels in Bay Area wastewater have now exceeded the winter peak, according to Stanford’s WastewaterSCAN team, which monitors coronavirus presence in human sewage. This also means Bay Area COVID-19 levels are rising faster than the statewide average. While coronavirus presence has increased 55% in California over the past three weeks, according to &lt;a href="https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/calwws/"&gt;the California Department of Public Health’s wastewater tracking&lt;/a&gt;, those statewide numbers haven’t surpassed winter highs — as like they have in the Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rise is fueled in part by a new subvariant called NB.1.8.1, dubbed “Nimbus.” People who’ve been infected with this strain have also reported suffering a particularly nasty sore throat among their symptoms, earning this latest strain the unpleasant nickname “razor blade throat.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, what do you need to know about the symptoms of NB.1.8.1? What’s the COVID-19 incubation period in 2025, how long should you isolate and where can you still find a free COVID-19 test? And if you’re unfortunate enough to suffer “razor blade throat,” what can you do to ease your symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep reading for everything you need to know about the new Nimbus variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-nb-1-8-1-and-is-it-worse-than-previous-variants"&gt;What is NB.1.8.1, and is it worse than previous variants?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, Nimbus is the most prevalent COVID-19 subvariant in the United States, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions"&gt; estimates currently makes up 43% of cases nationwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nimbus is absolutely more transmissible — that is, more contagious and more easily caught — than previous variants, said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UCSF. That’s how a new variant ends up beating its siblings and “rising to the top of the charts,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s “no evidence that it causes more serious disease,” Chin-Hong said, echoing &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;the World Health Organization’s May briefing designating Nimbus a “variant under monitoring.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite this, NB.1.8.1 &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; still cause more people to go to the hospital with COVID-19, he said, “because if it’s fueling more people getting it, some of those people are going to be more vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-the-new-nimbus-covid19-variant"&gt;What are the symptoms of the new Nimbus COVID-19 variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong confirmed that no surprising wild card symptoms have yet been reported for NB.1.8.1 — they’re the same COVID-19 symptoms you’re used to hearing about from previous variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the one symptom that doctors are hearing about from patients is the very painful throat that’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-sore-throat-razor-blade-vaccine-4688df53917022cb61204e08b41d5952"&gt;earned the unfortunate nickname “razor blade throat.”&lt;/a&gt; Or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/1ldvned/new_razor_blade_throat_covid_subvariant_quickly/"&gt;as Reddit commenters have described it&lt;/a&gt;, “like being burned by acid whenever I ate or drank something” and “like my throat was coated in broken glass.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is Nimbus, a descendant of the omicron variant that first emerged in 2021, causing such sore throats? “I think omicron in general prioritizes the upper respiratory tract instead of the getting into the lungs as much,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8989396/"&gt;One 2022 study from the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; found that a higher proportion of patients — up to 70% of those studied — reported sore throats when infected with the omicron variant compared with earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with previous variants to reach the Bay Area, Chin-Hong noted that more people also now appear to experience non-respiratory symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting when they get COVID-19 — gastrointestinal symptoms that folks can often initially dismiss as being unrelated to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/"&gt;this is the full list of the possible symptoms of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fever or chills&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Muscle or body aches&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;New loss of taste or smell&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sore throat&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Congestion or runny nose&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Nausea or vomiting&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, you might have a combination of these symptoms or just one. They might be mild or feel more severe. But if you’re experiencing any of these, take a COVID-19 test (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ok-so-how-can-i-soothe-my-razor-blade-throat-if-im-infected"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;OK, so how can I soothe my ‘razor blade throat’ if I’m infected?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this kind of severe sore throat, it might be tempting to focus on topical medicine for your throat itself. But in general, systemic therapies — treatments which enter through your bloodstream, like Advil, and affect your whole body — “are better than topical ones,” Chin-Hong said. His recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ibuprofen and acetaminophen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen (like Advil) is better than acetaminophen (like Tylenol) in this case, he said, although you should check with your health provider if you have other medical conditions which might make taking ibuprofen unsafe. If your throat hurts too much to swallow a pill, you can consider liquid versions of these drugs, but make sure you use the right dose depending on age, Chin-Hong said. And if you’re using a combination cold remedy like Nyquil, be aware it might already contain ibuprofen or acetaminophen — and be careful not to accidentally double-dose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic remedies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could try warm remedies like chicken soup, broth, lemon tea, honey or cold ones like popsicles, ice cream or ice chips. The upside of these treatments is the immediate relief they can bring, but they might also not last as long. You could also try gargling salt water, “which may loosen mucus” Chin-Hong said, or sucking lozenges with menthol or a mild anesthetic like benzocaine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental treatments to try &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong also recommends:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay hydrated&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Get your rest&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Don’t smoke or expose yourself to smoke&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consider a humidifier, as dryness may make your symptoms worse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you should consider seeking medical attention if your symptoms last longer than a week, if your sore throat is very severe, and if you begin drooling or become unable to eat or drink, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-current-covid19-cases-in-the-bay-area-right-now"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the current COVID-19 cases in the Bay Area right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual “COVID cases” — that is positive test results — are no longer tracked as closely by local and state public health bodies. In the absence of widespread up-to-date data on positive test results, monitoring the presence of the coronavirus in human sewage has become an increasingly important way to gauge the levels of COVID-19 spread in a particular area. This is because if you have COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1963120/one-way-to-monitor-a-communitys-coronavirus-infections-raw-sewage"&gt;the virus will show up in your feces &lt;/a&gt;soon after you’re infected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite recent increases in COVID-19 levels in the Bay Area’s wastewater, “average concentrations are still lower than this time last year” when &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11987343/covid-bay-area-wastewater-variant-symptoms-isolation-guidance"&gt;the Bay Area experienced a summer surge, &lt;/a&gt;said Amanda Bidwell from Stanford’s WastewaterSCAN team. However, the Bay Area’s wastewater sites monitored by Stanford are currently in the “high” category, she told KQED on Monday, with a “statistically significant upward trend” in the last three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check the COVID-19 levels in your &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=CkUQACABSABSBjVhYTY5OVIGMDJkMjQyUgZkZDM2ZmJSBjY3YzJlYlIGMjkzYjI1WgZOIEdlbmV40gGKAQY1OTRlYzPAAQE%3D&amp;amp;selectedChartId=594ec3"&gt;Alameda County’s wastewater&lt;/a&gt; according to WastewaterSCAN’s monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="is-the-latest-covid19-vaccine-still-effective-against-the-new-variant"&gt;Is the latest COVID-19 vaccine still effective against the new variant?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes: &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine that rolled out in August 2024 &lt;/a&gt;is effective against the NB.1.8.1 variant, Chin-Hong said. “It’s a descendant of JN.1, which all the last year’s vaccines were based on, which we still have around.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12001396/where-can-i-get-new-covid-vaccine-near-me-2024"&gt;get your COVID-19 shot in the fall, Chin-Hong has a message&lt;/a&gt;: Go get one now, particularly if you plan to travel abroad this summer. Not only will your protection last roughly a year, he said, “getting it now if it’s being paid for would help that person navigate through what we might see in the summer, but also later on in the year if rules change” — referring to the widespread uncertainty about &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fda-kennedy-covid-shots-rfk-trump-bb4de15b6ff955d6cd0b406aaec3cdc5"&gt;how President Donald Trump’s administration might further change the U.S.’s vaccine policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"&gt;Currently, the CDC recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for most adults 18 and older&lt;/a&gt;, which means that most health insurance companies should cover the costs for people with insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="i-think-i-was-exposed-or-have-symptoms-when-should-i-take-a-covid19-test"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I think I was exposed or have symptoms. When should I take a COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Know about updated incubation times for NB.1.8.1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve heard that incubation times for the virus are getting shorter — that is, the amount of time between getting exposed to COVID-19 and testing positive — it’s true. People are testing positive more quickly than they were in 2020, when the average incubation period was five to seven days, because it has changed with each new variant, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days is a common period of time between exposure and getting sick, Chin-Hong said, and given this trend, it makes sense to take a COVID-19 test as early as two days after exposure if you’re already having symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Don’t trust a negative early COVID-19 test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your first test is negative, you should absolutely test again the next day if symptoms persist — and again after that if you’re still negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s why you can’t necessarily trust a negative at-home COVID-19 test in 2025: While incubation times have gotten shorter, doctors are seeing people take longer to get a positive test, Chin-Hong said, and that’s probably more to do with how much quicker someone with COVID-19 might develop &lt;em&gt;symptoms&lt;/em&gt; in 2025 than they would have done in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, those symptoms are the sign that your body’s immune system is mounting a response to an invading virus. Back at the start of the pandemic, by the time you developed COVID-19 symptoms and took a test, it would probably already be positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at this stage of the pandemic, “we likely have more immune cells circulating that can recognize the enemy, so it ‘sounds the alarm’ quicker [and] people might feel something faster than in the old days,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician and researcher at Stanford University, also put it this way for NPR in 2024: “With our immune systems primed, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2024/01/07/1222847727/coronavirus-faq-my-partner-roommate-kid-got-covid-and-i-didnt-how-come"&gt;the body’s response [now] comes much more quickly than it would have back in 2020&lt;/a&gt; when SARS-CoV-2 was a novel pathogen.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And because many of us take a COVID-19 test when we &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; to feel sick, we might actually be testing way too early for an at-home antigen kit to successfully detect enough virus inside us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: If you’re testing because you’ve started feeling unwell, don’t assume a negative result means you don’t actually have COVID-19. Play it safe, stay home as much as you can and wear a well-fitted mask if you can’t. Take another antigen test 48 hours later, Chin-Hong said. You can also seek out a PCR test, which is more sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Make sure your COVID-19 test hasn’t expired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those COVID-19 tests you might have in a drawer may be approaching their expiration date if they haven’t already passed it. And an expired test could give you an unreliable result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;You can check the FDA’s list of antigen test types &lt;/a&gt;to see &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests#list"&gt;whether the box you’re holding has had its shelf life extended&lt;/a&gt; by the manufacturer. The FDA said that if a test’s shelf life has been extended, it’s because the manufacturer has given the agency enough “data showing that the shelf-life is longer than was known when the test was first authorized.” (In other words, it’s still OK to use that test.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another tip from Chin-Hong: “A quick and dirty way” to know if you’re using a functional COVID-19 test is to make sure the control line turns positive. If that doesn’t happen, “that means the test is probably not working,” he warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-i-test-positive-how-long-do-i-have-do-isolate-with-covid19-in-2025"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If I test positive, how long do I have do isolate with COVID-19 in 2025?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, the CDC officially revised their national COVID-19 isolation guidance, saying that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0301-respiratory-virus.html"&gt;COVID-positive people could now return to work or regular activities&lt;/a&gt; once “symptoms are improving overall” and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html"&gt;they’ve been fever-free for at least 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; without use of a fever-reducing medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11973108/how-long-to-isolate-with-covid-in-2024-california-now-says-that-depends-on-symptoms"&gt;Read more about current isolation guidance for COVID-19.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been infected, consider asking your health provider for the COVID-19 medication &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11914514/if-you-get-covid-should-you-try-to-get-paxlovid-heres-how-with-or-without-health-insurance"&gt;Paxlovid, an antiviral treatment in pill form that is still available free by prescription in California. &lt;/a&gt;Read more on &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11914514/if-you-get-covid-should-you-try-to-get-paxlovid-heres-how-with-or-without-health-insurance"&gt;requesting a prescription for Paxlovid, with or without health insurance.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-can-inbspstillnbspfind-a-free-covid19-test"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Where can I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; find a free COVID-19 test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a quick, free COVID-19 test — whether an at-home antigen test or a PCR test — has gotten progressively harder at this stage of the pandemic as more sites and services have been shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And visiting &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/"&gt;the White House site that once offered you free at-home COVID-tests&lt;/a&gt; through USPS will now greet you with an image of Trump superimposed over the headline “LAB LEAK: The True Origins of COVID-19,” as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/18/g-s1-61324/lab-leak-white-house-covid-origins"&gt;a page dedicated to the theory disputed by many scientists&lt;/a&gt; that the pandemic was caused by the coronavirus leaking from a government laboratory in Wuhan, China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you do now if you don’t already have a supply of antigen tests for COVID-19 at home right now? Try the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="purchase-a-covid19-athome-antigen-test-at-a-pharmacy-near-you"&gt;Purchase a COVID-19 at-home antigen test at a pharmacy near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest option will also be one of the most expensive up-front: Purchasing an at-home antigen test at a nearby pharmacy. (Ideally, ask someone to purchase one for you so you don’t potentially expose other people at the pharmacy, and if you really have to go yourself, wear a well-fitted N95 mask to help lower the risk you pose to others.) These at-home test kits are usually around $20 for a pack of two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you can &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11969300/how-to-get-reimbursed-for-at-home-covid-tests-in-2023"&gt;request reimbursement from your health insurer for the cost of up to eight at-home tests per month&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t throw away your receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="find-a-covid19-pcr-testing-site-near-you"&gt;Find a COVID-19 PCR testing site near you&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCR testing is more accurate than an antigen test. It’s more sensitive at picking up traces of the coronavirus in your body, but it may take longer to get your results than with an at-home test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are still some sites offering free COVID-19 testing around the state. Try visiting &lt;a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/testing.html"&gt;MyTurn.ca.gov/testing&lt;/a&gt; and applying the “Free Sites” filter from the drop-down menu. You can also find&lt;a href="https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/"&gt; a health center near you &lt;/a&gt;and ask if they offer COVID-19 testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://testinglocator.cdc.gov/Search"&gt;The CDC’s COVID-19 test locator&lt;/a&gt; is no longer operational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have health insurance, you may be able to get a PCR test ordered by your health care provider with the costs covered. Having a test ordered by a provider is — usually — the only way to get your testing costs covered if you have Medicare, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re insured through major Bay Area providers like Kaiser Permanente or Sutter Health, the easiest way to get a COVID-19 test may be to make an appointment through your provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most providers offer sign-ups online through a member login and appointments can also be made by phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a common heart surgery, some patients experience migraines with visual auras — temporary vision disturbances, such as flashing lights and zigzag lines. The reason for this unusual complication was a mystery, but now, research hints that blood clots in the brain may be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These [clots] have previously not been thought to result in any symptoms or to have any clear adverse consequences," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/gregory.marcus" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/gregory.marcus" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Gregory Marcus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, published July 7 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527125026141?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527125026141?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Heart Rhythm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, proposes a new theory about why these mysterious migraines manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-sign-of-something-serious-3"&gt;A sign of something serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To treat arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, doctors perform a catheter ablation, which involves inserting a tube into the heart to burn or scar any heart tissue driving the irregularity.

One theory posits that the hole created by transseptal puncture might trigger the complication by rerouting blood from its typical path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood normally circulates from the right side of the heart to the lungs, then to the left side of the heart, and finally to the rest of the body, including the brain. However, a puncture could allow blood to travel directly &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/01.wnl.0000201271.75157.5a" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/01.wnl.0000201271.75157.5a" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;from the left to the right heart chambers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, bypassing the lungs. Researchers think this detour could allow some type of neurotoxin — normally broken down by lung enzymes — to reach the brain and trigger auras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, MRI scans have revealed an alternative visual-aura trigger: brain lesions caused by emboli, meaning bits of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-causes-blood-clots" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-causes-blood-clots"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blood clots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, air bubbles or fatty deposits that travel through the bloodstream and then obstruct blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migraines with visual auras also occur in people without a history of heart surgery, but the mechanism behind the phenomenon is unclear in those scenarios, as well. Marcus said that previous studies have found that people who experience these auras, in general, tend to also have a history of brain emboli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But it has been very difficult to determine if there was a causal relationship between the two," he said. Since brain emboli tend to be ephemeral, clinicians would have to conduct scans around the same time that the patient reports the auras to spot a link, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients undergoing catheter ablation may present a chance to explore the connection, because the surgeries can cause more emboli to appear. Debris from the burnt heart tissue can travel to the brain, block blood flow, and thus starve the brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, Marcus said. These lesions are temporary, but he and his team suspected that the emboli may be linked to the auras following heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they conducted a trial in which 63 arrhythmia patients were treated with the transseptal puncture and 57 with the retrograde approach. The patients underwent brain MRI scans the following day and completed a questionnaire one month later to report any visual auras. It turned out both surgical techniques were equally likely to result in visual auras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings here show that the presence of a hole that provides communication between the right and left sides of the heart is not at all necessary for these visual auras to occur," Marcus said. Yet, looking at the MRI scans, they found that patients with brain emboli after surgery had a 12 times higher chance of developing visual auras than patients without emboli did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="next-steps-3"&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once thought to produce no symptoms, brain emboli may at least partly contribute to visual auras, Marcus said, adding that scientists should explore if the emboli are also linked to more serious problems, like stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study has some weaknesses, though. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/andrewg-lee/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.houstonmethodist.org/doctor/andrewg-lee/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Andrew Lee&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ophthalmologist at Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas who was not involved with the work, noted that "the main limitations were that the migraine symptoms were self-reported." It's possible that "even a validated and prospectively obtained questionnaire might misclassify a given participant's symptoms," Lee told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted that the study did not assess whether any patients had a naturally occurring hole in their heart, called a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3271/8/3/25" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3271/8/3/25" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;patent foramen ovale&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This hole between heart chambers forms during development and closes shortly after birth in most people, but in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109712007590" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109712007590" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;25% of people,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it stays open.

Whether poached, scrambled, or sunny side up, eggs have remained a breakfast staple around the globe. Yet, for decades, they’ve also been the subject of dietary controversy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health professionals once warned us to limit our egg intake due to cholesterol concerns. They feared that too many eggs might clog arteries and increase the risk of heart disease. But as science continues to evolve, so do our ideas about food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from the &lt;a href="https://www.unisa.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt; now challenges these long-standing beliefs. The research offers clear evidence that eggs may not deserve their bad reputation. Instead, they could be an unexpected ally in maintaining heart &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/just-one-handful-of-pecan-nuts-each-day-can-lower-cholesterol-heart-health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; if eaten the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eggs-were-blamed-for-heart-problems"&gt;Eggs were blamed for heart problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings arrive at a crucial time. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death across the globe. Nearly 18 million people die from CVD each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, one person dies every 12 minutes due to CVD. That is one in four lives lost to heart-related issues. With such staggering statistics, it is essential to understand what truly contributes to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, experts assumed cholesterol-rich foods like eggs played a direct role in raising LDL cholesterol, often called “bad cholesterol.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This assumption led to dietary guidelines that limited egg consumption. But Professor Jon Buckley and his research team wanted to look closer. They suspected that the real story was more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eggs have long been unfairly cracked by outdated dietary advice,” Professor Buckley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eggs-don-t-raise-bad-cholesterol"&gt;Eggs don’t raise bad cholesterol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what’s being called a world-first study, UniSA researchers set out to separate myth from fact. They explored how dietary cholesterol and saturated fat independently affect LDL cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team designed a controlled diet study where participants consumed two eggs daily. The key twist? The overall &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/the-power-of-fish-oil-in-combating-high-cholesterol/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; was high in cholesterol but low in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were surprising. Eating two eggs a day, within a low saturated fat diet, actually reduced LDL cholesterol levels. That means the cholesterol in eggs did not raise the risk of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, when saturated fat intake stayed low, dietary cholesterol from eggs had little to no negative effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we separated the effects of cholesterol and saturated fat, finding that high dietary cholesterol from eggs, when eaten as part of a low saturated fat diet, does not raise bad cholesterol levels,” Buckley explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-new-culprit-emerges"&gt;A new culprit emerges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if not eggs, what’s really behind elevated cholesterol &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/good-cholesterol-may-increase-the-risk-of-dementia/"&gt;levels&lt;/a&gt;? The answer lies in saturated fat. This kind of fat is found in processed meats, fatty cuts of red meat, full-fat dairy products, and many baked goods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people eat these foods regularly, LDL cholesterol levels can rise, increasing the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley and his team highlight that eggs, although rich in cholesterol, contain very little saturated fat. This balance makes them quite different from other animal-based foods. It also means that we need to reevaluate which foods are the true culprits in heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, it was the saturated fat that was the real driver of cholesterol elevation,” Buckley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eggs-are-fine-but-fatty-sides-are-not"&gt;Eggs are fine, but fatty sides are not&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study changes how we might think about the classic cooked breakfast. It is not the eggs on your plate that should raise &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-salmon-can-help-lower-your-cholesterol/"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt;. It is what you pair them with. Greasy bacon, processed sausages, and buttered toast may be the real threat to your heart, not the eggs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could say we’ve delivered hard-boiled evidence in defence of the humble egg,” noted Buckley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you are standing in front of a sizzling pan, think carefully. Eggs can remain on the menu. But you might want to skip that second sausage link or the extra slice of fried bread. The study reminds us that balance is more important than banishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eggs-in-a-cholesterol-friendly-diet"&gt;Eggs in a cholesterol-friendly diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are not only versatile but also packed with essential nutrients. They contain high-quality protein, vitamins like B12 and D, and healthy fats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people trying to maintain a balanced diet, eggs can offer both nourishment and convenience. The new research finally gives them a fair chance to shine without guilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, when it comes to a cooked breakfast, it’s not the eggs you need to worry about – it’s the extra serve of bacon or the side of sausage that’s more likely to impact your heart health,” said Buckley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to let go of outdated advice. Science has turned the tables on cholesterol myths, allowing eggs to reclaim their place on the breakfast table. When part of a low saturated fat diet, eggs do not just taste good, they might actually support your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916525002539?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 13:51:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQTkpuMUlUWUlLSEp6SUJFR25HdGdwQ3oyQmNaZ2xqV09yd1FOWElxcmUxcWVyaVd0RndrUUhIZzFBbkVJenRxaTVPb2NWSGcxSndYbXJvT3JBa0ZsZlNCRW12WTFIM21nX1Y2dVdMd2xmRk5CY0hqbGJ2ZGItM1JBU2VsYw</guid></item><item><title>为什么美国人燃烧的卡路里比以往任何时候都多，但体重却不断增加-研究发现 | Why Americans Keep Gaining Weight Despite Burning More Calories Than Ever - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNM25MZjRSOExkYnM5V01MVTZxbm1SSUVqOUtYOFVJbjdHWl8yTmY3bll3R1d5VlltWGt3OGh4WGIzczIwZE9rZE5fN05KbE1xV2ZHRkxiaE9aNnhKa0JYSFczNUhBOXBtZDc2TU5PR2c5MkVwSVM2b3hUS0d0Mm9oWUZWS05mcE1ZNHVodmFyMTNPQndZYUhkY25uSGJKZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A global study of 4,213 adults finds that people in wealthier countries actually burn &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; daily calories than those in traditional lifestyles.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Obesity in developed nations is not driven by inactivity but by increased intake, especially of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Physical activity levels did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; significantly decline with economic development, challenging common obesity assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The percentage of ultra-processed food in the diet was strongly linked to higher body fat, suggesting food quality—not movement—is the key issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DURHAM, N.C. —&lt;/strong&gt; Americans burn more calories daily than people living traditional lifestyles in developing countries. Yet we’re also significantly fatter. How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Duke University study of 4,213 people spanning 34 populations worldwide — from Tanzanian hunter-gatherers to Norwegian office workers — shows that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/weight-gain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;expanding waistlines&lt;/a&gt; have little to do with becoming less active. What we eat, not how much we move, is the real driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2420902122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, found that “daily energy expenditures are greater in developed populations, and activity energy expenditures are not reduced in more industrialized populations.” This directly challenges the common assumption that declining physical activity is the main cause of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors write in the study’s significance section, these results “suggest that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dietary intake &lt;/a&gt;plays a far greater role than reduced expenditure in the elevated prevalence of obesity associated with economic development.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-developed-countries-actually-burn-more-daily-calories"&gt;Developed Countries Actually Burn More Daily Calories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To measure how many calories people actually burn each day, the researchers used a technique called “doubly labeled water,” which tracks how quickly the body processes certain harmless isotopes over 7 to 14 days. It’s considered the most accurate method available for measuring total energy expenditure in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the study found that people in more economically developed countries &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fitness-trackers-fitbit-calories-inaccurate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burned more&lt;/a&gt; calories per day than those in less developed ones. This wasn’t just because they were taller or heavier, though body size did explain part of the difference. Even after adjusting for weight and muscle mass, the difference in calories burned was modest, only about 6%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also expected to see lower &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/effects-sitting-offset-by-30-minutes-exercise/"&gt;physical activity levels&lt;/a&gt; in wealthier nations, but that wasn’t the case. Across all 34 populations studied, people in industrialized societies were just as physically active as those in traditional or rural settings. There was “no significant change” in physical activity levels with economic development, meaning people across different lifestyles generally moved their bodies just as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-ultra-processed-foods-drive-weight-gain"&gt;How Ultra-Processed Foods Drive Weight Gain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The real difference between countries wasn’t how much people moved. It was what they ate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the 25 populations where dietary data were available, one trend stood out clearly: the more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/ultra-processed-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; people consumed, the more body fat they tended to carry. These foods — like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sugary-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt;, packaged snacks, and ready-to-eat meals — are industrially made and often contain long lists of ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, one likely explanation is that these foods are easier to digest, which means the body absorbs more calories from them. Less energy is lost during digestion, and more gets stored. Some studies suggest these foods may also interfere with the body’s hunger signals, causing people to eat more than they need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though people in wealthier countries were burning more calories, they were also eating more; and not just more food overall, but more food that seems to encourage &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/fat-around-muscles-deadlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fat storage&lt;/a&gt;. Because participants in the study maintained a stable weight during the measurement period, the researchers were able to infer that calorie intake must have closely matched calorie expenditure at the time. That means the high calorie burn in developed countries is matched by equally high consumption, likely driven by food quality rather than quantity alone&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-fighting-obesity"&gt;What This Means for Fighting Obesity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that physical activity is still vital for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall health&lt;/a&gt;. It lowers the risk of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, improves &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental well-being&lt;/a&gt;, and helps maintain a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. But when it comes specifically to obesity, the biggest factor appears to be the kind of food people eat, not how much they move.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study also found that much of the increase in body mass in wealthier countries came from muscle and lean tissue, not just fat. In other words, better access to nutrition helps support healthy growth, even as it contributes to weight gain. Still, body fat increased more than &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/muscle-mass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to a mismatch between calorie intake and the body’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What stood out most was this: the differences in body fat between rich and poor countries were about 10 times greater than any differences linked to how many calories people burned. That’s a powerful argument for focusing on the food environment — what’s available, affordable, and marketed to people — rather than just telling individuals to exercise more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, public health campaigns have leaned on the slogan “eat less, move more.” This study suggests it’s time to shift focus. The root of the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obesity crisis&lt;/a&gt; may not be laziness, but the global rise of ultra-processed foods that are cheap, convenient, and engineered to be overeaten.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This study is observational and cross-sectional, meaning it cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships. While the data strongly support associations between economic development, ultra-processed food consumption, and obesity, the authors note that more research is needed to clarify the underlying physiological and environmental mechanisms. Additionally, dietary data were only available for a subset of populations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 4,213 adults aged 18–60 across 34 populations representing different levels of economic development, from hunter-gatherers to industrialized societies. They used the doubly labeled water method, considered the gold standard for measuring energy expenditure, which tracks isotope depletion in body water over 7–14 days to calculate total daily calories burned. Body composition was measured using deuterium dilution to determine fat-free mass, fat mass, and body fat percentage. Economic development was categorized using the UN Human Development Index, which incorporates measures of wealth, education, and life expectancy. The study also examined dietary data from 25 populations, including the percentage of ultra-processed foods in people’s diets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Body fat percentage and obesity rates increased significantly with economic development across all populations studied. However, total daily energy expenditure was actually higher in more developed countries, primarily due to larger body sizes. When adjusted for body size, energy expenditure decreased only modestly (6–11%) with development, and this small difference could explain only about one-tenth of the obesity differences between populations. Surprisingly, physical activity energy expenditure showed no significant decline with economic development. Among populations with dietary data, the percentage of ultra-processed foods in the diet was positively correlated with body fat percentage, demonstrating that dietary intake rather than reduced energy expenditure drives obesity in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used cross-sectional data, making it impossible to establish causality in the relationships between economic development, diet, and obesity. Detailed dietary information was available for only 25 of the 34 populations studied. The research could not identify specific environmental, social, or physiological factors that promote increased calorie intake and absorption in developed settings. Some energy expenditure measurements used estimated rather than directly measured basal metabolic rates. The study also couldn’t resolve whether differences in food quality, quantity, digestibility, or other factors drive the dietary effects observed.&lt;/p&gt;
