Sedentary behaviour from a young age can lead to a two-thirds increase in cholesterol levels in adulthood, heightening the risk of cardiac issues and premature death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, new research suggests that light exercise could completely counteract these dangers. The study highlights that activities such as walking and doing household chores might eliminate the need for cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Childhood high cholesterol has been linked to early indicators of heart disease in adults and a higher chance of dying from cardiovascular issues prematurely. Interestingly, the study proposes that light physical activity may be more beneficial than more intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team behind the research believes that global guidelines for children's physical activity should incorporate their findings. Dr Andrew Agbaje from the University of Exeter, who spearheaded the study, commented: "These findings emphasise the incredible health importance of light physical activity and shows it could be the key to preventing elevated cholesterol and dyslipidaemia from early life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "We have evidence that light physical activity is considerably more effective than moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in this regard, and therefore it's perhaps time the World Health Organisation (WHO) updated their guidelines on childhood exercise, and public health experts, paediatricians, and health policymakers encouraged more participation in light physical activity from childhood."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added: "Our research suggests light physical activity may be an unsung hero and it is about time the world replaced the mantra of 'an average of 60 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity' with 'at least 3 hours a day of light physical activity'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Light physical activity appears to be the antidote to the catastrophic effect of sedentary time in the young population."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The WHO currently recommends that children and adolescents should build up an average 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity a day and reduce sedentary time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has limited guidelines for light physical activity. However, the study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, found light physical activity – which also includes slow dancing, swimming, or cycling – is up to five times more effective than moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at promoting healthy hearts and lowering inflammation in the young population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, which analysed 792 children, utilised a device akin to a pedometer to measure sedentary time, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at ages 11, 15, and 24 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cholesterol levels were repeatedly assessed at ages 15, 17, and 24 years, and the children also underwent repeated evaluations of total body fat mass and muscle mass, as well as various blood tests, with smoking status, socio-economic status, and family history of cardiovascular disease taken into account. Sedentary time increased from roughly six hours a day to nine hours a day, over the course of the 13-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Light physical activity decreased from six hours a day to three hours a day while moderate-to-vigorous physical activity remained relatively stable at around 50 minutes a day from childhood until young adulthood. The average increase in total cholesterol was 0.69 millimoles per litre (mmol/l).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research found that an average of four-and-a-half hours a day of light physical activity from childhood through young adulthood decreased total cholesterol. Approximately 50 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity from childhood was also associated with slightly reduced total cholesterol (-0.05 mmol/L), but total body fat mass decreased the effect of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on total cholesterol by up to 48%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted that the rise in fat mass counteracted the modest impact of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on total cholesterol levels. Dr Agbaje remarked: "Our study shows increased sedentary time in childhood may contribute to two thirds of the total increase in a person's cholesterol levels before their mid-twenties. This suggests childhood sedentariness may be a major risk factor for elevated cholesterol and subsequent premature heart attack or stroke when individuals reach their mid-forties."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2023 study, a collaborative effort by the University of Exeter, University of Eastern Finland, and University of Bristol, utilised data from the University of Bristol's Children of the 90s study, also known as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;NHS ways to lower your cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Eat less fatty food&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reduce your cholesterol, try to cut down on fatty food, especially food that contains a type of fat called saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can still have foods that contain a healthier type of fat called unsaturated fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check labels on food to see what type of fat it has in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Try to eat more:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;oily fish, like mackerel and salmon&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;olive oil, rapeseed oil and spreads made from these oils&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;brown rice, wholegrain bread and wholewheat pasta&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Try to eat less:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;meat pies, sausages and fatty meat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;butter, lard and ghee&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cream and hard cheese, like cheddar&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cakes and biscuits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;food that contains coconut oil or palm oil&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Exercise more&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aim to do at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of exercise a week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some good things to try when starting out include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;walking – try to walk fast enough so your heart starts beating faster&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;swimming&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cycling&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try a few different exercises to find something you like doing.

The findings suggest that age-related impairments in tactile perception — including sensitivity to pressure, vibration, and object recognition — may predict cognitive challenges and even the progression toward dementia. The review outlines how changes in the brain’s sensory processing areas, especially the hippocampus, are tightly linked to both declining touch perception and memory, attention, and executive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted this review to better understand how age-related sensory decline, particularly in the tactile system, could be a harbinger of cognitive impairment. As global populations continue to live longer, mild cognitive impairment is becoming more common, affecting roughly one in six older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, this condition progresses to dementia. Identifying early markers of decline can help delay or prevent more serious outcomes. Since most people experience some level of tactile deterioration as they age, the authors wanted to explore whether this decline could provide an early and accessible signal of future cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, the research team examined previous studies that analyzed tactile deterioration across the aging brain. They reviewed evidence from human studies as well as animal models, especially in rodents, which allowed researchers to isolate and manipulate tactile input through experimental methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across this body of literature, the authors looked for connections between loss of tactile function, brain changes, and cognitive outcomes. They paid special attention to the hippocampus and its links to tactile input, spatial memory, and executive function. The review also included structural imaging studies and behavioral assessments, giving a comprehensive overview of how sensory decline and cognitive decline might unfold together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review begins by outlining the gradual decline of the tactile system with age. As early as age 20, touch sensitivity begins to decrease, and by age 60, these changes can be clinically detected. Mechanoreceptors in the skin, particularly Meissner’s and Pacinian corpuscles that detect fine touch and vibration, begin to disappear. The nerves that transmit tactile information lose some of their insulating material, which slows signal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes affect not just the skin but also the spinal cord and brain, particularly the primary somatosensory cortex, which becomes thinner with age and shows reduced inhibition. This results in poorer touch discrimination, difficulty in manipulating objects, reduced fine motor control, and problems with balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then connected these sensory changes to cognitive decline, particularly in the context of mild cognitive impairment. This condition is defined as a decline in mental functioning that goes beyond normal aging but does not yet interfere significantly with daily activities. It is often a precursor to dementia. Studies show that mild cognitive impairment is more common with increasing age, affecting over one-quarter of people aged 80 or older. Importantly, over a third of these individuals eventually develop dementia. Understanding what triggers this progression is key to prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the review, one of the earliest areas of the brain to show changes in mild cognitive impairment is the hippocampus, a region essential for memory, learning, and executive functioning. The hippocampus receives sensory input from the somatosensory system via the entorhinal cortex. Tactile input helps the hippocampus integrate information and support cognitive flexibility and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this input is diminished due to aging or sensory deprivation, hippocampal function may suffer. For instance, studies in rodents show that depriving animals of tactile input through whisker removal reduces hippocampal activity, impairs spatial memory, and disrupts synaptic communication in memory-related regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one type of experiment, researchers permanently removed the whiskers of rodents, which serve as their primary tactile system. These animals showed significantly less brain activity in the hippocampus, reduced formation of new neurons, and problems with navigation and object recognition. In contrast, stimulating the whiskers increased dopamine levels in the hippocampus and improved memory performance. These findings mirror what has been observed in human studies, where reduced tactile stimulation can lead to poorer cognitive outcomes, while tactile engagement can improve memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review also highlights proprioception — the sense of body position and movement — and stereognosis — the ability to recognize objects through touch — as key components of the tactile system that are affected by aging. Both are critical for daily functioning and are also linked to cognitive performance. When these abilities decline, individuals may experience increased risk of falls, reduced independence, and fewer opportunities for cognitive engagement. This drop in activity and stimulation can, in turn, accelerate cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more compelling findings discussed in the review is the link between tactile impairments and changes in the neurochemistry of the brain. Sensory stimulation boosts levels of acetylcholine, a chemical that plays a major role in attention and memory. It also promotes the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), both of which help support the growth and survival of neurons. Tactile deprivation, by contrast, lowers these factors, potentially triggering cell death and weakening memory circuits in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that this body of evidence supports the idea that tactile deterioration may be more than just a sign of aging — it could be an early marker of cognitive risk. If so, touch-based assessments could become a valuable tool in detecting people who may benefit from early intervention. This is especially important because many traditional cognitive screening tools may miss early signs, or may not be accessible to all populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review suggests several directions for future research. One recommendation is to develop standardized methods for measuring tactile function, including proprioception and stereognosis, in older adults. These assessments could be added to routine cognitive screenings. Another area for exploration is whether tactile-based interventions — such as textured objects, massage therapy, or sensory-rich environments — can help protect or even restore cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also encourage more research into how different sensory systems interact and contribute to overall cognitive health, including studies that combine touch, sound, and visual stimulation to promote brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2025.109048" target="_blank"&gt;The role of tactile sense as an early indicator of cognitive decline in aging&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Nereida Ibarra-Castaneda, Adriana Gonzalez-De-la-Cerda, and Oscar Gonzalez-Perez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 14:08:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPTzJMUEdMNU1JbXRUYjhJMVU3TG5wWG42U05hMkQyVFpiSTNuQV8xX3NmN3c3WnRyY1VlVkQ3MmF0ZEdob1dqUEFXSGR2QlNjdy1obVc1SEQtZWJkQkR3VE5YWmdsUkh5WW12bjNFOWt6RGRIRklBZUhoRkRQanYzQnN5Y05jS0dGNWNVN1I0UUE</guid></item><item><title>照片：为什么这些女性需要勇气在镜头前摆姿势-美国国家公共广播电台 | Photos: Why it took courage for these women to pose for the camera - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxNOVl6bV9ycklKcTFyMnZKcGQ0R2RrVGYwcHdUUU56dHU3dnVrcW40SjR5eXVBS091S2szWnA3cDN0RC10aDRBZ2xOZVo1MVktZmlMd2xEQUNKRENMNjlUb3EzUFFfb2c0ZmRoWk9tSWFpc2hKOGg5MU5Vc2V1UnFKaUVwbEtBQlNEaldNcDA1S3F0Qmlvd3l1X05tT1dMc0tuS3lpZzY1N0FLMTJtVEtIV3VCeWNhQk1vbTlGNDJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                The photo exhibit &lt;em&gt;Sahy Rano&lt;/em&gt;, on display at the Photoville Festival in Brooklyn, New York, through this weekend, draws its title from a Malagasay phrase translated in a wall label as meaning "someone who is not afraid to dive into the water, even if there is a strong current." The photographer wants to bring attention to female genital schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by a waterborne parasitic infection, whose symptoms can be stigmatizing because they resemble symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases. From left to right: former patients Rahama Abdallah, Sylvia Razanaparana and Suzanie Yolandrie. They were photographed in September 2024 in the district of Ambanja in Northern Madagascar.

   &lt;p&gt;A woman named Sylvia Razanaparana, robed in a white dress atop a marine blue shirt, faces the camera with a blue bucket atop her head. The backdrop is sea blue canvas dotted with drops of white. Her hand propped on her hip, she stares at the camera at a three-quarter angle, as if she has something to show, or say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And she does.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She is one of eight women who posed for photographer Miora Rajaonary for a project to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a disease that, according to the World Health Organization, afflicts an estimated 56 million women and girls, mainly in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The waterborne infection is spread by parasitic worms and is found particularly in areas with limited access to clean water and health care.  It is contracted through contact with infected water in which women work (such as rice fields), bathe and do laundry. Considered by the United Nations as one of the most neglected of tropical diseases, it can result in infertility, ectopic pregnancy and genital ulcers. And because its symptoms — including vaginal itchiness and discharge, bloody urine and abdominal and pelvic pain — can resemble those of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), their onset can bring suspicion, shame and dishonor on those who contract them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/female_genital_schistosomiasis_and_hiv_en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report by the U.N. agency UNAIDS&lt;/a&gt; characterizes the disease as "underdiagnosed, with grave implications for women's sexual and reproductive health." It is also linked to a higher risk for contracting HIV from an infected partner.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Men can contract the disease as well but a WHO report notes that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/increasing-awareness-on-genital-manifestations-of-schistosomiasis#:~:text=Genital%20schistosomiasis%20affects%20both%20female%20and%20male%2C,complications%20are%20much%20more%20prevalent%20in%20women.&amp;amp;text=WHO%20in%20collaboration%20with%20UNAIDS%20published%20an,FGS%20and%20sexual%20and%20reproductive%20health%20interventions." target="_blank"&gt;"the clinical signs and complications are much more prevalent in women."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-73497" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://end.org/a-lurking-threat-to-women-and-girls-health-closing-the-information-gap-on-female-genital-schistosomiasis/" target="_blank"&gt;Razanaparana contracted FGS&lt;/a&gt; while working in the rice fields of Ambanja, in northern Madagascar. Her husband accused her of betraying him because of the STD-like symptoms and left her. Only after suffering from the symptoms for four years was she able to be seen by a doctor, visiting her village as part of a medical mission. He quickly diagnosed her, and the deworming medicine praziquantel cured her.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Her story spoke powerfully to Rajaonary, who has included her portrait in her photo exhibit &lt;em&gt;Sahy Rano&lt;/em&gt;, currently on display at the Photoville Festival in Brooklyn, New York. The title is a Malagasay phrase translated in a wall label as meaning "someone who is not afraid to dive into the water, even if there is a strong current." It also also means "someone is really brave," adds Rajaonary, who is herself from Madagascar. Her work was supported by the End Fund, a philanthropy that works to prevent the spread of neglected tropical diseases&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-73498" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The title of the project, says the photographer, is especially apt because some of the women, like Razanaparana, work in the rice fields "so they have to be in the water for their livelihoods. They have no choice but to keep going back" returning to the very waters where they were initially infected.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;To further emphasize their courage in breaking taboos and coming forward to speak about the disease in public, the women portrayed wear traditional Malagasy face masks. Made of cosmetic paste and ground sandalwood, they are both decorative and used to protect the skin. In adorning themselves with beauty masks, they are showing they are like everyone else, with no need to hide. "I sometimes wear a mask when I am on holiday in Madagascar," Rajaonary says. They are very attractive. This is a tradition over centuries."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-73499" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The effect of the painted backdrop, prepared by Rajaonary, is that the women appear to be standing against, or sitting in the water. The white dots, she says, are symbols of the parasites that infest local waters.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also set up a laundry rope across the canvas backdrop, from which hang the women's shirts, sheets, dresses and clothing — as if the clothing had just been put up to dry after being washed in the contaminated water. "This is their clothing, their laundry, what they wear and how they live," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The colorful pails and buckets visible in each photo also call attention to water's inescapable presence in the women's lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diane Cole writes for many publications, including &lt;/em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;em&gt; She is the author of the memoir &lt;/em&gt;After Great Pain: A New Life Emerges. &lt;em&gt;Her website is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dianejoycecole.com/" target="_blank"&gt;DianeJoyceCole.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kim Beckham, an insurance agent in Victoria, Texas, had seen friends suffer so badly from shingles that she wanted to receive the first approved shingles vaccine as soon as it became available, even if she had to pay for it out of pocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her doctor and several pharmacies turned her down because she was below the recommended age at the time, which was 60. So in 2016, she celebrated her 60th birthday at her local CVS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was there when they opened,” Beckham recalled. After her Zostavax shot, she said, “I felt really relieved.” She has since received the newer, more effective shingles vaccine, as well as the pneumonia shot, the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, annual flu shots and all recommended COVID vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some older people are really eager to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Wolaner, 71, a retired publisher in Sausalito, Calif., has been known to badger friends who delay getting recommended shots, sending them relevant medical studies. “I’m sort of hectoring,” she acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deana Hendrickson, 66, who provides daily care for three young grandsons in Los Angeles, sought an additional MMR shot, though she was vaccinated as a child, in case her immunity to measles was waning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For older adults who express more confidence in vaccine safety than younger groups, the past few months have brought some welcome research. Studies have found important benefits from a newer vaccine and enhanced versions of older ones, and one vaccine may confer a major bonus that nobody had foreseen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new studies are coming at a fraught political moment. The nation’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long disparaged certain vaccines, calling them unsafe and saying that the government officials who regulate them are compromised and corrupt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the secretary fired a panel of scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, replacing them with some who have been skeptical of vaccines. But so far, Kennedy has not tried to curb access to the shots for older Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence that vaccines are beneficial remains overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phrase “Vaccines are not just for kids anymore” has become a favorite for Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The population over 65, which often suffers the worst impact of respiratory viruses and others, now has the benefit of vaccines that can prevent much of that serious illness,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take influenza, which annually sends from 140,000 to 710,000 people to hospitals, most of them older than 65, and is fatal to 10% of those hospitalized older patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For about 15 years, the CDC has approved several enhanced flu vaccines for people older than 65. More effective than the standard formulation, they either contain higher levels of the antigen that builds protection against the virus or incorporate an adjuvant that creates a stronger immune response. Or they’re recombinant vaccines, developed through a different method, with higher antigen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a meta-analysis in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, “all the enhanced vaccine products were superior to the standard dose for preventing hospitalizations,” said Rebecca Morgan, a health research methodologist at Case Western Reserve University and an author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the standard flu shot, the enhanced vaccines reduced the risk of hospitalization from the flu by 11% to 18% in older adults. The CDC advises adults older than 65 to receive the enhanced vaccines, as many already do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More good news: Vaccines to prevent RSV in people older than 60 are performing admirably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants, and it also poses significant risks to older people. “Season in and season out,” Schaffner said, “it produces outbreaks of serious respiratory illness that rivals influenza.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the Food and Drug Administration first approved an RSV vaccine in 2023, the 2023-24 season provided “the first opportunity to see it in a real-world context,” said Dr. Pauline Terebuh, an epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and an author of a recent study in the journal JAMA Network Open. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In analyzing electronic health records for almost 800,000 patients, the researchers found the vaccines to be 75% effective against acute infection, meaning illness that was serious enough to send a patient to a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccines were 75% effective in preventing emergency room or urgent care visits, and 75% effective against hospitalization, both among those ages 60 to 74 and those older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunocompromised patients, despite having a somewhat lower level of protection from the vaccine, will also benefit from it, Terebuh said. As for adverse effects, the study found a very low risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that causes muscle weakness and that typically follows an infection, in about 11 cases per 1 million doses of vaccine. That, she said, “shouldn’t dissuade people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC now recommends RSV vaccination for people 75 and older, and for those 60 to 74 if they’re at higher risk of severe illness (from heart disease, say).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;As data from the 2024-25 season becomes available, researchers hope to determine if the vaccine will remain a one-and-done, or whether immunity will require repeated vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People older than 65 express the greatest confidence in vaccine safety of any adult group, a KFF survey found in April. More than 80% said they were “very “or “somewhat confident” about MMR, shingles, pneumonia and flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the COVID vaccine drew lower support among all adults, more than two-thirds of older adults expressed confidence in its safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even skeptics might become excited about one possible benefit of the shingles vaccine: This spring, Stanford University researchers reported that over seven years, vaccination against shingles reduced the risk of dementia by 20%, a finding that made headlines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biases often undermine observational studies that compare vaccinated with unvaccinated groups. “People who are healthier and more health-motivated are the ones who get vaccinated,” said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an public health researcher at the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience at Stanford and lead author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to know whether this is cause and effect,” he said, “or whether they’re less likely to develop dementia anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Stanford team took advantage of a “natural experiment” when the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, was introduced in Wales. Health officials set a strict age cutoff: People who turned 80 on or before Sept. 1, 2013, weren’t eligible for vaccination, but those even slightly younger were eligible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sample of nearly 300,000 adults whose birthdays fell close to either side of that date, almost half of the eligible group received the vaccine, but virtually nobody in the older group did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just as in a randomized trial, these comparison groups should be similar in every way,” Geldsetzer explained. A substantial reduction in dementia diagnoses in the vaccine-eligible group, with a much stronger protective effect in women, therefore constitutes “more powerful and convincing evidence,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found reduced rates of dementia after the shingles vaccine was introduced in Australia and other countries. “We keep seeing this in one data set after another,” Geldsetzer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, where a more potent vaccine, Shingrix, became available in 2017 and supplanted Zostavax, Oxford investigators found an even stronger effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By matching almost 104,000 older Americans who received a first dose of the new vaccine (full immunization requires two) with a group that had received the earlier formulation, they found delayed onset of dementia in the Shingrix group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How a shingles vaccine might reduce dementia remains unexplained. Scientists have suggested that viruses themselves may contribute to dementia, so suppressing them could protect the brain. Perhaps the vaccine revs up the immune system in general or affects inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think anybody knows,” said Dr. Paul Harrison, a psychiatrist at Oxford and a senior author of the study. But, he added, “I’m now convinced there’s something real here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shingrix, now recommended for adults older than 50, is 90% effective in preventing shingles and the lingering nerve pain that can result. In 2021, however, only 41% of older Americans had received one dose of either shingles vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A connection to dementia will require further research, and Geldsetzer is trying to raise philanthropic funding for a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And “if you needed another reason to get this vaccine,” Schaffner said, “here it is.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers found that drinking one to three cups of coffee a day could help you live for longer, protecting you against potentially fatal heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, in &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002231662500286X?via%3Dihub"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, tracked the daily coffee consumption of 46,332 people over the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow up of 11 years, they found black coffee and coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat—like milk or cream—had a 14 per cent lower risk of death compared to no coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;span&gt;one cup of black coffee a day, specifically, slashed the risk of death including cardiovascular death, by 16 per cent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who drank between two and three a day saw the risk lowered by 17 per cent.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers noted that the benefits peaked at three cups a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that those who added high amounts of sweeteners and dairy to their coffee did not experience the same benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers acknowledged, however, that the coffee consumption was self-reported by volunteers, so may have been underreported, limiting the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was also assessed without detailing the roast used and preparation methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

(WKRC) - An 11-year-old girl who beat cancer allegedly died after the hospital gave her "excessive" pain medication instead of properly treating her, prompting a lawsuit from her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a lawsuit obtained by&lt;em&gt; Law&amp;amp;Crime&lt;/em&gt;, 11-year-old Ava Wilson's family filed a lawsuit against Advocate Children's Hospital regarding the way the organization treated Wilson's follow-up treatment after she began remission for b-lymphoblastic leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family claimed that during a follow-up appointment on Oct. 29, 2020, they told staff that Wilson was having difficulty walking and was "crying in pain." Furthermore, lab tests reportedly found that the child had "low platelet counts, low blood cell counts, and high liver enzymes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Wilson was not held for further observation or treatment and was instead sent home with an increased prescription for morphine and gabapentin, the family claimed. This decision was reportedly "endorsed" by Wilson's regular oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of admitting Ava to the hospital to get her blood pressure, heart rate and pain levels within acceptable and normal limits, Advocate employees sent Ava home," said the trial's lead attorney, Matthew L. Williams. Williams claimed that the amount of medication given to Wilson was "excessive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days after the appointment, on October 31, Wilson died in her sleep due to lethal amounts of morphine in her system, the lawsuit claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family argued in its lawsuit that the new doses, 100 mg of gabapentin three times a day and 15 mg of morphine every four hours as needed, were much more than the child's previous prescription, and her attorney noted that if "taken together, the medications can make each other stronger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital's representatives argued that Wilson's health was in-line with leukemia complications, and that the prescribed medication was "within the recommended range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forensic neuropathologist testified during the trial that the child died due to the medication in her system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit finally concluded on June 10 when the jury agreed with the Wilson family and awarded them $20,500,000, citing "past and future loss of society and past and future grief, sorrow and mental suffering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 12:55:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>逐步淘汰NIH对HIV临床指南的支持的管理-《华盛顿邮报》 | Administration to phase out NIH support of HIV clinical guidelines - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxPUXZkQWZMdXBVczRLX01tZkNtT3cxV25Ndml3SFFZMlJBdHRINnVFQ0pEdmJWWHljOXM1dTQzM0gxSkhLNlFtUHBTb0ozYURkM1JPZzFEWWgxOFU4bkZ3bWdTVXFsMU1VR3BpLVJSWE5wRWNNWENGUXNpNGlac24zclVFOWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QL6L626OVVASLFWUEKPA25BW7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The National Institutes of Health’s support for federal guidelines that steer the treatment of more than a million HIV patients in the United States will be phased out by next June, according to the agency’s Office of AIDS Research, a move that troubled some doctors and raised questions about whether the guidelines themselves will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3WJBZ3AHOFAXLGWANTDJW3HICQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is unclear whether Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

They were burning the candle at both ends, and they were taking a lot of injectable drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJUWZTDJXBGF7ODZD4OZPACHPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Under Kennedy, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/04/hiv-trump-cuts-prep/" target="_blank"&gt;HHS has terminated&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of millions of dollars in HIV-related research grants.

							&lt;p data-start="152" data-end="547"&gt;We all know someone who seems to glide through the decades with the same energy and sparkle they had at twenty‑five. They’re not blessed by genetics alone—they practise small, repeatable habits that science links with slower biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="152" data-end="547"&gt;Below are nine of the most compelling morning rituals I’ve found in the literature (and tried myself) that appear to keep Father Time on the back foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="554" data-end="615"&gt;1. They greet the sunrise instead of the snooze button&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="616" data-end="1127"&gt;Early exposure to natural light anchors your circadian rhythm, lowers evening melatonin at the right time, and, remarkably, is associated with longer telomeres—the shoelace tips of your DNA that fray as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="616" data-end="1127"&gt;A Mendelian‑randomisation &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10558505/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that a “morning chronotype” correlates with reduced telomere attrition, while daily‑diary research shows that as little as 20 minutes of morning sunlight predicts better sleep that night—another youth‑preserving dividend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1131" data-end="1276"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1131" data-end="1140"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Pull back the curtains, open a window, and let dawn light hit your eyes (without sunglasses) while you breathe for five calmer minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1283" data-end="1329"&gt;2. They meditate before they caffeinate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1330" data-end="1755"&gt;Stress accelerates biological ageing; mindfulness turns down the dial. Reviews by Nobel‑Prize laureate Elizabeth Blackburn and colleagues suggest that meditation dampens stress reactivity and may preserve telomere length over time. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3057175/"&gt;2021 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; came to similar conclusions. In plain English: ten quiet minutes on the cushion today can translate into younger cells tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1759" data-end="1892"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1759" data-end="1768"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Sit upright, count ten slow breaths, and notice the feel of the air. If your mind bolts, that’s normal—gently call it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1899" data-end="1947"&gt;3. They move their bodies (gently counts)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1948" data-end="2449"&gt;From brisk walking to sun‑salutation yoga, morning movement supplies oxygen, stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, and is repeatedly linked to slower biological age. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10274991/"&gt;Long‑term physical‑activity studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10572212/"&gt;large U.S. datasets&lt;/a&gt; show that regular running or jogging corresponds with longer leukocyte telomeres and lower all‑cause mortality. You don’t need to be an ultramarathoner—20‑30 minutes of moderate exertion is enough to switch on the anti‑ageing machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2453" data-end="2575"&gt;&lt;em data-start="2453" data-end="2462"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Lace up before breakfast. I run 4–5 km at conversational pace, then stretch—my mood (and skin) thank me all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="2582" data-end="2646"&gt;4. They rehydrate before anything else touches their lips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2647" data-end="3050"&gt;Ageing cells shrink when chronically dehydrated. An &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2023/good-hydration-linked-healthy-aging"&gt;NIH‑led cohort&lt;/a&gt; found that adults whose serum‑sodium levels signalled sub‑optimal hydration were up to 50 % more likely to present a “biological age” older than their actual years, and had higher premature‑mortality risk. Two tall glasses of water on rising &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/good-hydration-linked-healthy-aging?"&gt;help the brain&lt;/a&gt;, kidneys, and skin start the day fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3054" data-end="3158"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3054" data-end="3063"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Keep a carafe on your night stand. Down 500 ml, then chase it with whatever hot brew you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="3165" data-end="3229"&gt;5. They eat an antioxidant‑rich, protein‑steady breakfast&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3230" data-end="3711"&gt;Mountains of oxidative‑stress research point to berries, nuts, greens, and quality proteins as first‑line defenders against cellular damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3230" data-end="3711"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/13/4/394"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em data-start="3382" data-end="3396"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt; and other journals emphasise that diets dense in polyphenols, vitamin C, and plant fats correlate with healthier ageing trajectories. Translation: swap sugary cereal for Greek yoghurt, blueberries, chia, and a handful of almonds and you’re feeding your cells’ clean‑up crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3715" data-end="3811"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3715" data-end="3724"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; I blend spinach, frozen berries, pea protein, and oat milk—five minutes, zero excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="3818" data-end="3864"&gt;6. They scribble a quick gratitude line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3865" data-end="4220"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/experiencing-gratitude-associated-with-greater-longevity-among-older-adults/"&gt;Harvard‑Chan School analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 49,000 older women found that those scoring highest on a gratitude questionnaire had a 9 % lower risk of death over four years, even after controlling for health behaviours. Gratitude lowers inflammatory markers and boosts positive affect, both known moderators of ageing pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4224" data-end="4376"&gt;&lt;em data-start="4224" data-end="4233"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Write one thing you’re thankful for on a sticky note. Stick it to the kettle. The repetition rewires the default‑mode network toward optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="4383" data-end="4419"&gt;7. They delay the doom‑scroll&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;Smartphones spike cortisol and fragment attention—two ageing accelerants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/dealing-with-smartphone-stress"&gt;Clinical commentary&lt;/a&gt; from Australia’s College of GPs links intensive phone use with higher self‑reported stress and disturbed cortisol rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;By keeping screens off for the first 30 minutes, slow‑agers guard that fragile morning calm and let their HPA‑axis warm up naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4814" data-end="4907"&gt;&lt;em data-start="4814" data-end="4823"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Activate “do not disturb” until you’ve finished breakfast. Your inbox will survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="4914" data-end="4962"&gt;8. They apply sunscreen—yes, even indoors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5380"&gt;Photo‑ageing accounts for up to 80 % of visible facial ageing. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/"&gt;landmark randomised trial&lt;/a&gt; proved that daily broad‑spectrum SPF 30 slowed wrinkle formation and hyper‑pigmentation in middle‑aged adults, independent of genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5380"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/sunscreen-and-your-morning-routine"&gt;Johns Hopkins dermatologists echo:&lt;/a&gt; apply after cleansing, before makeup, every single morning. Your skin will quite literally look younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5384" data-end="5472"&gt;&lt;em data-start="5384" data-end="5393"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Keep a pump bottle beside your toothbrush. Habit stacking beats forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="5479" data-end="5534"&gt;9. They plot one purpose‑driven goal for the day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2740716/?"&gt;Longevity research&lt;/a&gt; shows that having a “sense of purpose” predicts lower mortality risk, even when health, wealth, and personality are controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;Rolling out of bed and deciding “what one thing will make today meaningful?” primes dopamine circuits and sustains motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;Over months, that goal‑orientation supports healthier behaviours and social ties—keys to ageing slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5956" data-end="6064"&gt;&lt;em data-start="5956" data-end="5965"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Write your single, soulful intention on a note card and carry it in your wallet. Re‑read at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6071" data-end="6097"&gt;Bringing it together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6098" data-end="6380"&gt;You’ll notice none of these practices require expensive gadgets or eight‑step biohacking regimes. They’re simple, repeatable, and grounded in psychology’s favourite anti‑ageing levers: lower chronic stress, tighter circadian rhythms, stable metabolic health, and positive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6382" data-end="6622"&gt;My challenge to you: choose &lt;strong data-start="6410" data-end="6417"&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; habit tomorrow morning and stick with it for a week. Then layer another. Ageing may be inevitable, but the &lt;em data-start="6525" data-end="6531"&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; at which we age is negotiable—and the negotiation begins before 9 a.m. See you at sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

Nearly a century later, scientists started to figure out how it's stored and used for energy in the human body. They experimented with extracting creatine from meat and later synthesizing it in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn't until the Barcelona &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-surprises-attending-paris-olympics-regular-person-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 that creatine went mainstream. The British gold-medal sprinters, sharing how they got in shape, gushed about the powerful effects of a little-known supplement: creatine. In 1993, the first commercial creatine hit store shelves, and sales boomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a raw material for producing ATP, a molecule that gives our cells energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of creatine is stored in the muscles, where it offers a ready fuel source for high-intensity effort. More creatine can improve strength and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/muscle-building-potential-gains-progress-monthly-trainer-2022-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;muscle gains&lt;/a&gt; by providing a bit more energy, helping you push a little bit harder and work out for longer before getting tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies naturally produce creatine through a combination of amino acids. That's only a small amount, though. We can get more of it from some foods like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/red-meat" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and fish — or, through supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past five years, demand for creatine as a fitness aid has spiked, with retail prices up 150% and sales increased by 90% year over year, despite steadily rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's not just for muscle-hungry gym bros.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;While men continue to make up the majority of creatine users, about 21% of the creatine buyers are women, according to data from nationwide supplement retailers The Vitamin Shoppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At SuppCo, both Glen, the CSO, and Steve Martocci, the CEO, said their wives have recently started taking creatine — reflecting a broader trend of women as a growing consumer base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martocci pointed to more evidence dispelling the myth that creatine is just for muscle men to bulk up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/16/3567" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;early research&lt;/a&gt; suggests creatine can support hormonal health for women, helping to counteract shifts that can occur during the menstrual cycle by helping to maintain levels of glycogen in the muscle for better energy and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f485d814-927b-420c-83c8-ed0f2b157411" data-toc-id="f485d814-927b-420c-83c8-ed0f2b157411"&gt;Creatine slows aging and boosts brain health, per new research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, a small study found that patients with Alzheimer's disease saw a boost to their &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brain-ages-more-57-70-78-protein-exercise-sleep-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; after supplementing creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that just providing more energy to the brain could be useful," Scott Forbes, a sports science researcher and professor at Brandon University who was not involved in the study, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The brain actually uses about 20% of your total energy expenditure, even though it only weighs about 2% of your body weight. So for a tissue, it's very energetically demanding," Forbes said.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Creatine also seems to have an anti-inflammatory effect, making the brain more resilient against stresses that would wear down its ability to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that too much inflammation or too much oxidative stress can also lead to poor cognition or poor brain functions," Forbes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other recent studies have found that supplementing creatine could also help to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-age-you-faster-make-you-look-older-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;mitigate the effects of aging&lt;/a&gt; or a concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The theory is that the brain can remodel itself or at least maintain its function during times of stress," Candow, the aging researcher at Regina University, told Business Insider. "I don't know anybody in the world that's not stressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research is expanding creatine's reach to consumers beyond the gym, according to Muriel Gonzalez, president of nationwide supplement retailer The Vitamin Shoppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Creatine is undergoing a major transformation — from a niche sports nutrition supplement to a versatile tool for daily health and longevity," Gonzalez told Business Insider over email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total creatine sales have spiked by 300% from 2019 to 2024 at The Vitamin Shoppe, and are continuing to grow at a double-digit pace, according to company data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;You'll be disappointed if you expect to transform your life, and health, with a few doses of creatine. A supplement can provide a boost but ultimately makes a relatively small difference. Your overall diet, exercise, and lifestyle are far more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the bottom line is that more and more research supports taking creatine for a huge range of benefits, with very little downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think almost everybody should consider taking creatine," Forbes, the science researcher at Brandon University, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in high doses over a long time period, side effects are mild, such as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/stomach-ache" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastrointestinal upset&lt;/a&gt; and a slight increase in water retention, since creatine pulls water into the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall it's one of the safest supplements out there," Eric Gonzalez, a neuroscience professor at Texas Christian University who has studied creatine, told Business Insider. "If anyone wants to go on a supplement, creatine won't hurt you, there's only going to be an upside."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're losing weight — including those on a GLP-1 drug that triggers weight loss — creatine can help you retain muscle mass, promoting a higher ratio of muscle to body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-ways-to-improve-your-mood-according-to-psychologists" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;boost brain health or mood&lt;/a&gt;, early studies suggest that 10-30 grams a day may be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glen previously conducted research on senior Olympians who took creatine and found it helped them get stronger and faster while avoiding age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're never too old to take creatine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Despite the profound human, social and economic costs of alcohol abuse, existing treatments have failed to provide meaningful relief. Excessive alcohol consumption remains a leading cause of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240096745"&gt;death and disability worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. In the U.S. alone, &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health/national-releases/2023"&gt;16.4 million people&lt;/a&gt; age 12 and older reported binge drinking on five or more days in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are several drugs available to those seeking to stop or lower their alcohol consumption, their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2015.1133472"&gt;effectiveness is limited&lt;/a&gt;, and they often have significant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three decades, efforts to treat excessive drinking have focused primarily on developing drugs that target proteins that can control how neurons respond to stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these proteins are present in almost every neuron throughout the brain, the drugs also affect neurons that aren't directly responsible for regulating alcohol's effects. This often leads to unwanted side effects like headache, fatigue, drowsiness or insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my work &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gilles-Martin-3"&gt;as a neurobiologist&lt;/a&gt;, I study the idea that pinpointing the specific brain circuits that play a role in suppressing alcohol consumption is critical to developing targeted treatments with limited side effects. In my newly published research, my team and I identified a small cluster of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;neurons responsible for suppressing binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A map of binge drinking neurons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.mp.4000206"&gt;identified several brain regions&lt;/a&gt; that play a key role in alcohol abuse. But there has been strong evidence that only a very small number of neurons within these regions underpinned the effects of the drug on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small populations of neurons, called &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/memories-of-the-good-parts-of-using-drugs-can-keep-people-hooked-altering-the-neurons-that-store-them-could-help-treat-addiction-245529"&gt;neuronal ensembles&lt;/a&gt;, have been shown to play a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2015.07.009"&gt;key role&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11028"&gt;memory formation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35379803"&gt;experiencing fear&lt;/a&gt;. However, researchers haven't known whether the neuronal ensembles activated during binge drinking also influence binge drinking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000437413"&gt;billions of neurons&lt;/a&gt; contained in the brain, the task of identifying these neurons is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. To solve this challenge, my colleagues and I used a genetically modified mouse model that, upon exposure to alcohol, activates a gene coding for a red fluorescent protein that is selectively expressed in alcohol-sensitive neurons. By tracing these fluorescent neurons, we were able to make a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;map of the precise locations of affected neurons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified a discrete number of neurons that respond to binge drinking in a brain region called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.01.010"&gt;medial orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;. This area is known for its key role in controlling decision-making and adapting behavior to a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that turning this neuronal ensemble off resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;sharp increase of alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This means that the brain has, in essence, a built-in regulation system that is activated during alcohol drinking to act as a brake on its consumption. Should these neurons misfire, the regulatory system would fail, possibly leading to uncontrolled drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this study advances our understanding of how and where binge drinking modulates brain function in mice, it remains unclear whether human brains are also equipped with the same neuronal ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they are, stimulating these neurons may provide a path toward helping people who experience difficulty controlling their alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although selective control of neuronal activity is a formidable challenge, &lt;a href="https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2016/04/newsweek-umass-medical-school-develops-gene-therapy-for-rare-neurodegenerative-disease/"&gt;progress in gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; for patients with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="165378" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other rare diseases offers hope for more effective alcohol use disorder treatments with fewer side effects.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257217/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Millions of Americans have high cholesterol, which can lead to heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bedtime snack rich in fiber and plant protein may help lower cholesterol. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a cholesterol-lowering late-night snack, our Chia Seed Pudding checks all the boxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, you’re not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, millions of Americans have high cholesterol (aka hyperlipidemia).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This condition, defined as total blood &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels higher than 200 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, is a leading risk factor for heart disease. However, that doesn’t mean you’re destined for heart troubles. “Keeping cholesterol levels in a healthy range helps reduce the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/registered-dietitians#kathleen-benson" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kathleen Benson, RDN, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, healthy meals are the foundation of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering diet&lt;/a&gt;. But snacks can help, too—even the ones you eat before bed, like our ​​&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt;. It’s loaded with ingredients that can help reduce cholesterol. Yet, it’s light and satisfying enough that it won’t mess with your sleep. No wonder dietitians are huge fans. Here’s how it can help keep your heart healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-chia-pudding-is-great-for-high-cholesterol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Chia Pudding Is Great for High Cholesterol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the myriad benefits of enjoying a high-fiber diet is that it can help lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When I have a client trying to manage high cholesterol levels, we focus on getting more fiber and healthier fats in their diet,” says &lt;a href="https://bebalancednutritionrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meggie Connelly, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Filled with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, our Chia Seed Pudding delivers a hefty 11 grams of fiber per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds contain a mix of both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But it’s their soluble fiber that’s behind chia’s cholesterol-lowering powers. The reason? Soluble fiber can absorb some of the cholesterol in your gut, removing it from the body before it can cause trouble. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Low in Saturated Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, research has shown that cholesterol from food doesn’t always affect your blood cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The real culprit is saturated fat, found mainly in full-fat dairy, red and processed meat, lard and ghee. Saturated fat tells your liver to rev up its cholesterol production, which provides far more cholesterol than the amount we absorb from food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this chia pudding is made with almond milk, it contains merely 1 gram of saturated fat per serving. If almond milk isn’t your thing, feel free to sub in another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based milk&lt;/a&gt; like soy, cashew or oat milk or low-fat cow’s milk. Just steer clear of coconut milk and full-fat cow’s milk, which are both high in saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Plant Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you have high cholesterol or not, choosing a late-night snack that contains some protein is the key to staying satiated all night long. “This will help you feel full during the night and help control blood sugar levels so you’re not starving by the morning,” says&lt;a href="https://www.brannoninbalancenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brannon Blount, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Each serving of this chia pudding delivers 7 grams of protein. And not just any kind of protein. All of its protein is plant protein, which has been linked to better heart health. It’s so beneficial that the American Heart Association recommends getting most of our protein from plant sources like the chia seeds and nuts in this recipe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-heart-healthy-bedtime-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Heart-Healthy Bedtime Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A combination of fiber and protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider this the magic duo. “Fiber and protein combined, or paired together with an assortment of foods, can support steady blood sugar and satiety,” Benson says. That’s important because chronically high blood sugar levels can lead to diabetes, which increases heart disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients that are easy to digest.&lt;/strong&gt; When you’re trying to get some quality zzz’s, the last thing you need to eat is something that will upset your tummy or delay sleep even further. Choose something light, easy to digest and satisfying, yet low in fat and added sugars. In addition to chia pudding, oatmeal, popcorn and cereal with low-fat milk are all great options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something simple to assemble. &lt;/strong&gt;After a long day, it’s normal to experience some decision fatigue. But, instead of reaching for something with empty calories (we’re looking at you, bag of chips), choose something nutrient-dense that you can easily whip up. “Your late-night snack needs to be quick and easy to put together, like a banana and nut butter, or a peanut butter and sliced strawberry sandwich on whole-grain bread. Or make your chia pudding in advance,” says Connelly. “If you have to spend 30 minutes making your late-night snack, it’s not going to be something you do consistently.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking may get a bad rap, but if you didn’t eat enough during the day, a little nibble before bed might help you fall and stay asleep. That said, if you have high cholesterol, there are some considerations to keep in mind. If cholesterol is an issue, dietitians recommend choosing a snack that’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in fiber, low in saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and contains some protein. Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; checks all the boxes. So, whip some up today. You can double (or even quadruple) the recipe. And it will stay fresh in your fridge for up to three days for a hassle-free bedtime snack your heart will thank you for. &lt;br&gt;

Sometimes these mood swings can and should be examined as cause for concern, but a few TikTok creators explained how it's also good to take a step back and analyze our feelings before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anania00" rel="nofollow"&gt;TikTok content creator Anania&lt;/a&gt; told their followers that after eating, all of the depressive thoughts they were having before had simply gone away. Many people were quick to agree, while other content creators were able to put a name to that phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There are four things we should ask ourselves using the HALT technique before beginning to spiral:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's consider, though, I'm not a [expletive] and I'm just hungry at this moment, you know what I mean?" &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anania00/video/7248847178918169902" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anania began in their video&lt;/a&gt;. "Then we might be able to start our healing journey as a unit because I haven't thought about suicide in the past 20 minutes, and I just had a 3-piece from Popeye's. There's a correlation here, is all I'm saying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Anania's initial video was meant to be humorous, it sparked a conversation about how many of our negative emotions are often tied to simple issues that can be solved — i.e., eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/things-ask-ourselves-using-halt-before-spiraling.png" alt="woman using the HALT technique to determine she's hungry and not spiraling" title="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using The HALT Technique Before Spiraling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Photology1971 | Shutterstock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/stop-obsessive-negative-thoughts-become-positive-person"&gt;5 Simple Ways To Combat Obsessive Negative Thoughts — And Become A More Positive Person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Am I hungry?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zairell777/video/7250268182869478699" rel="nofollow"&gt;video stitching Anania's original clip&lt;/a&gt;, another content creator, @zairell777, pointed out that there is a way we can look within ourselves to stop our emotions from spiraling. "This person is spot [expletive] on," she said of Anania's revelation that they felt better after having a meal. She explained that it's part of a DBT skill that she had learned and was called HALT, an acronym for Hunger, Anger, Lonely, and Tired.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're feeling anything negative, if you feel any negative emotions [or] you're having some negative thought patterns, run down the list and then act accordingly," she continued. "Were you suicidal or did you just need some chicken?" She acknowledged that while that's not the case all the time, for many occurrences, being in a negative headspace can easily be solved by eating. The phenomenon, also called being "hangry," isn't an irrational feeling to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269629" rel="nofollow"&gt;findings published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269629" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, data showed that hunger was associated with 37% of changes in irritability, 34% in anger, and 38% in pleasure, suggesting that these emotions were caused by fluctuations in hunger. Researchers have even found that low blood glucose levels can trigger irritability, causing people to have a shorter fuse than usual when hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Am I angry?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger isn't exactly a pleasant emotional state, but it is completely normal, and it's important to acknowledge that. Psychiatrist and addiction specialist David Streem, MD, is a proponent of using the HALT method and he explained, “Just because you feel angry doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you,” he told the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/halt-hungry-angry-lonely-tired" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “But chronic, persistent anger is unhealthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to make that distinction. He went on to say, “Focus on who’s in the driver’s seat. When I’m upset and it’s time to move on to my next activity — to go home, to go to work — I should be able to turn that off and let it go in a real way, not just packing it down. That way, in my next activity, I can be present when I’m with my family or working with co-workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/reason-you-cant-get-past-anger"&gt;turn that anger off&lt;/a&gt;, and essentially move on, as Dr. Streem described, then you have a good grasp on your emotions and don't have cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-carrying-more-anger-realize"&gt;5 Signs You Might Be Carrying More Anger Than You Realize, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Am I lonely?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and feeling isolated can open the door to intrusive thoughts, which is why experts agree it's important, when you're feeling vulnerable, to determine if what you really need is human connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://cl.kp.org/natl/home/refcontainerpage.dam.nohf.public.html?damrefpath=/content/dam/clinicallibrary/scal/mem_ed/healthed/nutrition_month/chl035e-8.pdf&amp;amp;accessvia=scal_chl" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kaiser Permanente&lt;/a&gt; shared, once you have isolated loneliness as the cause for your negative emotions, you can take action by reaching out to loved ones. Additionally, you can make a plan to increase your community by joining local clubs or even trying out a new hobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/things-ask-ourselves-using-halt-before-spiraling-am-i-lonely.png" alt="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using HALT Technique Before Spiraling, Am I Lonely" title="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using The HALT Technique Before Spiraling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Dmytro Sheremeta | Shutterstock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lacyhartselle/video/7213437985717620014" rel="nofollow"&gt;In another video,&lt;/a&gt; TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lacyhartselle" rel="nofollow"&gt;creator Lacy&lt;/a&gt; expanded on how we can use HALT to check in with ourselves if we feel our emotions spiraling. "This is a good way to assess yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed or vulnerable and your thoughts are starting to spiral," Lacy said of the acronym. "Do I need to express some feelings here? Am I lonely? Do I need to phone a friend or at least journal to myself?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacy explained that HALT can help us catch ourselves before we turn our negative emotions and thoughts onto another person. "Am I Hungry? Am I Angry? Am I Lonely? Am I Tired? Do I need to address these things?" She added, "After you take action to meet your own needs and to check in with yourself, you can function from a more clear-headed and balanced space." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Am I tired?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like hunger, being tired is a physical state that can impact our emotions. As Dr. Streem stated, “Fatigue is like being hungry — it’s a condition that affects the brain.” It's as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habit-well-rested-people-use-fall-asleep-quickly"&gt;aren't getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; or you've even just had one bad bout of tossing and turning, acknowledging it allows you to make a simple action plan to help yourself. You can commit to a new sleep routine, cut out caffeine after noon, set a reasonable bedtime, or even indulge in some nice new bedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In the comments section, many people agreed with being able to use 'HALT' to assess their emotions.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For about a week, I was tracking my mood as part of a challenge from another app. Realized I started spiraling around 2:30 most days. Just needed food," one TikTok user pointed out. Another user added, "This has been such a powerful tool during my &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-therapist-recommends-start-feel-depressed"&gt;healing from depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t disregard this, people, it’s so true!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’ve told a lot of people since my therapist told me about this, too. It’s really helpful because a lot of us don’t know when we’re hungry or tired," a third user chimed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to practice self-awareness, stress management techniques, and finding healthy ways to cope with negative emotions can be extremely beneficial for our overall well-being and emotional care. As Dr. Streem wisely noted, “HALT is a wonderful reminder of the simplest things we often forget to do to take care of ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you or someone you know is in emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;suicidepreventionlifeline.org&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to connect to a trained crisis counselor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/emotionally-grounding-steps-solve-problem-life"&gt;The 5 Emotionally Grounding Steps That Can Help You Solve Any Problem In Life &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nia Tipton is a Chicago-based entertainment, news, and lifestyle writer whose work delves into modern-day issues and experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="field field--name-field-content-contains-affiliate field--type-boolean field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 01:20:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPRGJrQ3dmeF9WdldDSzRENzF5MlpGZnFLV2tsMFlXU3ZNMlpUMVBKMXBTYkNiemN4NUxDRjRHa1VvSDRUaFMxTUNKU2c5SmhFZzFrQ2dTYk8wLXpRQUNTNk5QdTJrZ1VSc29VSERGTVp3eTlOekpzVkF4RHpMRS1lTlFMMzF4U2NJd0FvM0NpM25sdw</guid></item><item><title>爱荷华州宣布麻疹爆发，美国超过1,200例确诊病例- PBS | Iowa announces measles outbreak as U.S. tops 1,200 confirmed cases - PBS</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPVjNvdmNKa2ZBazB3d0RLRkt5bmZIeGJfNklVeHhwVGdOM25BUmlIc2t1OEtia21Ob3lPOVAwczFWeDBKTC00LVZoMXp2T052RXc3Z05LbGtqNUhQOGt4Y1ZIRWZRUzZnQVRIWnlJc3dfTEJuN2FoOU9rUHdyZ04zV3Vsc1NKeFozYXQ4SXRPOEhlemFqemFNTUt3aGZDa0lHNHfSAacBQVVfeXFMTmNRcWN5T2Jydl9SR0h0UGlqWEIyN0VfcEhzclo3bGtIWVdSaU9YTjF6NjF4Nk5xYWtTT2ltMWR4b0NPQTFpV1VSMTRJejBLSS1PeDdXckY2cHBkdzVUSGFrNFlvaTlXMld6WTdXU1hlQU1BejQ1RldjMWllSnFOSjYtZTRYSTVJci1MZHFuWnV1UjZKS3pOaWFXOUswNDhJM2M1T0FFMzQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. logged fewer than 20 measles cases this week, though Iowa announced the state’s first outbreak Thursday and Georgia confirmed its second Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 1,214 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation’s biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed six cases in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=3d8451977cd34084a8b494a6a11b4f1a&amp;amp;sc_lang=en&amp;amp;hash=48D1A6D0D037B39BD421AAF060204EE0"&gt;2,179 cases&lt;/a&gt; from mid-October through June 17. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/diseases-know-no-borders-measles-spreads-with-outbreaks-in-canada-mexico-and-u-s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘Diseases know no borders’: Measles spreads with outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/measles"&gt;996 as of Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,335 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. states with active outbreaks — which the CDC defines as three or more related cases — include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 750 cases across &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7"&gt;35 counties, most of them in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, state health officials said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the outbreak, 97 people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;State health officials estimated&lt;/a&gt; less than 1% of cases — fewer than 10 — are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 413 cases since late January — just under 2% of its residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many measles cases are there in New Mexico?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Doña Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma added one case Friday for a total of 17 confirmed and three probable cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Arizona?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona has four cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said June 9. All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Colorado?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has seen a total of 16 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of 10 related cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May. Four of the people were on the flight with the first case — an out-of-state traveler not included in the state count — while five got measles from exposure in the airport and one elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are also tracking an unrelated case in a Boulder County resident. The person was fully vaccinated but had “recently traveled to Europe, where there are a large number of measles cases,” the state health department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Georgia?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia has an outbreak of three cases in metro Atlanta, with the most recent infection confirmed Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has confirmed six total cases in 2025. The remaining three are part of an unrelated outbreak from January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Illinois?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following weeks, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Iowa?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa has had six total measles cases in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four are part of an outbreak in eastern Johnson County, among members of the same household. County health officials said the people are isolating at home, so they don’t expect additional spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; has a total of 79 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but three of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Montana?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montana had 22 measles cases as of Friday. Fourteen were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up — Montana’s first in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in North Dakota?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Dakota, which hadn’t seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized. All of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials declared earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania over after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee’s outbreak also appears to be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year. Most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — due to “herd immunity.” But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOISE, Idaho — Health officials confirmed Wednesday that a bat discovered in downtown Boise earlier this week has tested positive for rabies, prompting warnings for people who may have encountered the animal.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Central District Health, the infected bat was found in front of the Owyhee Building on Main Street. Laboratory results confirming the rabies diagnosis were received on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department emphasized that while most bats do not carry rabies, the virus poses serious health risks to both humans and animals. Anyone who may have had close contact with the bat should consult their primary care physician about potential rabies vaccination and contact Central District Health epidemiologists at (208) 375-5211.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery serves as a reminder of the importance of proper safety protocols when encountering bats, which play a crucial role in local ecosystems. Central District Health advises people to never handle bats with their bare hands and to use thick, protective gloves when necessary to contain the animals for testing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners are urged to ensure their animals, including cats, receive current rabies vaccinations since domestic animals may encounter bats both outdoors and inside homes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can reduce their risk of rabies exposure by bat-proofing their properties with tight-fitting window screens and sealing entry points. Bats can squeeze through openings as small as a quarter. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central District Health offers additional rabies prevention resources on its &lt;a href="https://cdh.idaho.gov/environmental-health/hazards/bats-and-rabies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, along with information from the &lt;a href="https://idfg.idaho.gov/press/protect-people-protect-bats-and-avoid-rabies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Idaho Fish and Game&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/health-wellness/diseases-conditions/rabies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Idaho Department of Health and Welfare&lt;/a&gt;, regarding bat safety and home protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A dog in Raleigh is recovering after being bitten by a rabid
raccoon on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Animal Control was called to Windsor Trail in Raleigh on Thursday
after the dog had been bitten. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County Public Health and Wake County Animal Control
confirmed on Friday the raccoon tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to county officials, the dog was up to date on its
rabies vaccination and received a booster after being bitten. It is expected to
be ok. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is a serious public health concern, and we’re
grateful that this pet was protected through vaccination,” said Wake County
Commissioner Tara Waters. “This incident is an important reminder of why it’s
so critical to keep your pets up to date on their rabies shots.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anyone in the area who may have encountered a raccoon is asked to call the Wake County Communicable Disease line at 919-250-4462. If a person or their
pet may have been bitten or scratched, officials advise seeking medical
attention right away. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;County officials have provided a list of tips to help
minimize rabies risks:&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/rabid-raccoon-bites-dog-raleigh-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not approach animals that you do not know. Exercise caution and maintain a safe distance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal of unknown vaccination history, wash the wound immediately and seek medical attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure your pets have a current rabies vaccination. If your pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is strongly recommended. Keep outdoor pets indoors until they receive the booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs. Avoid any interaction that may result in potential exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid. Prevent attracting wild animals to your property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight to minimize the chances of attracting animals that may carry rabies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid, contact a veterinarian immediately. Seek professional guidance to ensure the well-being of your pet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of emergency room visits for Covid-19 in Vermont hit zero multiple times over the past week, “at or nearing” a historic low for that indicator, the Department of Health reported Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health department first reported a drop in Covid-19 hospital visits in its &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/COVID-19-Surveillance-report-20250618_0.pdf"&gt;weekly surveillance report&lt;/a&gt;. Epidemiologist John Davy confirmed via email there have been a few recent days with no emergency room visits, with the rolling average around one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote that overall hospitalizations for the disease, which includes Vermonters who have been in the hospital with Covid-19 for days or weeks, have not dropped to zero. But the number of current patients has been in the “low single digits” in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In past years, the period of late spring and early summer has been marked by low rates, followed by a rise in the late summer into early fall. Davy wrote it “remains to be seen” if that pattern will reappear in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There have been recent outbreaks in Long-Term Care facilities, so there is clearly some amount of COVID circulating,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state health department also reported it has detected the presence of a new Covid-19 variant, NB.1.8.1. The variant has made international headlines for &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-sore-throat-razor-blade-vaccine-4688df53917022cb61204e08b41d5952"&gt;causing severe sore throats&lt;/a&gt; nicknamed “razor blade throats.” But it has not been found in Vermont in large numbers, Davy wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no clear indication that NB.1.8.1 is associated with greater disease severity,” he wrote. “Preliminary lab studies suggest that vaccines will be effective against severe outcomes from this strain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of vaccines themselves are still uncertain, however. Covid-19 vaccines tailored to the dominant strains of the virus have typically become available in early fall, along with other seasonal vaccines like influenza. But U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has a long history of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-vaccine-trump-science-autism-9b99621b01f11b7f0bdc81e5a0b82d2b"&gt;anti-vaccine activism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy recently dropped the recommendation for &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-you-still-get-a-covid-vaccine-this-fall-heres-what-to-know/"&gt;pregnant people and healthy children to receive the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;dismissed all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory panel, replacing them with eight of his own appointees, some of whom have previously objected to the Covid-19 shots.

But the “at least” part comes with a warning from state public health officials. The person, who is between 20 and 40 years old, has not traveled out of state recently, so must have picked it up here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The individual is “doing well and isolating, including having little contact with others,” according to Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist. But before diagnosis, others could have been exposed, she said. The individual was known to have visited several public places in the days before measles was confirmed. So other people may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said exposure can take place even days before early symptoms like runny nose, high fever, cough and red eyes show up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nolen, Department of Health and Human Services director Tracy Gruber and Dr. Stacey Bank, the department’s medical director, answered questions about the case and measles in general during a news conference Friday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Gruber emphasized that because of the national outbreak of cases, Utah health officials had anticipated there would be local cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; notes 1,214 confirmed measles cases nationally as of June 19, across 36 jurisdictions, including Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;CDC said there have been 23 outbreaks this year, and nearly 90% of cases are outbreak-associated. Last year, there were 285 measles cases, so numbers are much higher this year, led by big outbreaks in Texas with more than 700 cases, New Mexico, where numbers hit 100 and Oklahoma, which has more than 50 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;All those numbers only reflect confirmed cases, not probable measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-measles" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About measles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Symptoms typically appear a week or two after exposure. A high fever above 102.2°F is common. The early symptoms may not lead one to think of measles: cough, runny nose and red eyes. The rash usually shows up after four days of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles is a very contagious disease and the illness can be miserable and even dangerous, including diarrhea, ear infections, pneumonia, encephalitis, seizures and even death. Those complications, per the department, are more common among children younger than 5 who have not been vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant people and those with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Most people get over measles pretty well, but there are lots of exceptions. One in 20 people who contract measles end up in the hospital. Three people have died of measles in the United States in the last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Health officials are also warning unvaccinated people to talk to their doctor if they visited locations where the Utah County individual was before becoming ill. It’s still possible to infect others before symptoms arise. The individual is known to have visited Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13 and Timpanogos Regional’s emergency room on June 14. No time was given for the former, but the exposure period for the emergency room visit would have been between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Advice-to-be-vaccinated" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Advice to be vaccinated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nolen emphasized that the measles vaccine is the best way to protect people from measles. Two doses are 97% protective and a single dose is 93% protective. Plus, should someone who is vaccinated get measles, the symptoms are milder, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1584" data-height="1056"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/LNDT3QOXX5HLFOMMTREEQY5SGU.jpg?auth=5051e170a02361bc25cece63129222bd33a74958bb938030e5854a15eb80fb24&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/LNDT3QOXX5HLFOMMTREEQY5SGU.jpg?auth=5051e170a02361bc25cece63129222bd33a74958bb938030e5854a15eb80fb24&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Matt Caldwell, left, a Lubbock Fire Department official, administers a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to Clair May, 61, at the Lubbock Health Department, Feb. 26, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Mary Conlon, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah is generally pretty well protected, 90% of the population vaccinated. “Unfortunately, we have seen a decrease in the vaccine in our little kids in Utah. The numbers are still not super low, but they’re low enough to cause us to be concerned that there could be kids who are vulnerable to this, and certainly there are parts of our state or schools that have higher numbers of kids that are not vaccinated.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said health officials are “certainly concerned but reassured that most are protected,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;CDC numbers suggest that Utah’s early grade school vaccination rate is lower than that in Texas, where the outbreak has been so high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nolen said anyone who doesn’t know their measles vaccine status can look it up in Utah or check with their health care provider. It’s also possible to get an antibody test to find out. But there’s no danger if someone who doesn’t know gets another shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For those who are immune compromised, Bank told Deseret News that a titer test would say something about their level of protection because it measures antibodies, but a new vaccination might not be the best plan if protection appears to be low. Those folks should talk to their doctor. The shot contains a bit of live virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s one of the reasons herd immunity is important. Some people, including very young children, cannot be vaccinated against measles, but being surrounded by people who won’t get measles because they already had it or are vaccine-protected and therefore can’t pass it on — herd immunity — is protective, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The (measles-mumps-rubella) MMR vaccine has been used since the early 1970s. It has saved millions of lives and prevented significant suffering around the world,” Nolen said in a written statement. During the news conference, she called it “safe and effective,” noting decades of careful research that says the vaccine’s benefits outweigh risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;People born before 1957 are considered immune now as they likely had measles as children, before a vaccine was readily available. Utah health and human services officials are urging anyone going out of state or out of the country to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Many vaccination records are available online at https://immunize.utah.gov/usiis-parents-individuals/ or through the Docket app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:28:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNU1FqbjBNMnVTX1VRX2pYcnVWVTY5UUVuZllOWUg1STNkNXlPQWpyVWFLOTJNY1Q5RHhocEQ0QlM2NkUtSGJrR3VzRmF6WXV4UEhIdmhQbDFIeGN5ZkJnZmlXYnplVnBrQktsWGhRbHQ3aGJGOS1pQ0UzTVlqNzFFeUs1TEpEZ3RNYTc1N2N4c1V2aHZuTWRSbzE4dkdYWjZnTEhYNlowTnpvMGlnckZwOVpMOVA</guid></item><item><title>面部表情揭示隐藏的认知状态-神经科学新闻 | Facial Expressions Reveal Hidden Cognitive States - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE0xcVd5dFBrZ2dqY2VyNENjTWN2OWIzckRoSVk5MUgxbXNmTFFQNEtQVVR5clBqT3lYV1BwZzRxUGxPME4wb1owSm54d0ZqRG42UDFYUFJPTXdtTWR0ZW1PQm02R2JDR3JvRVdTNGVSY3VZbUd4X0Vldm5R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that facial expressions can reveal internal cognitive states, accurately predicting task performance across both macaques and mice. By analyzing facial features during a foraging task in a virtual reality setup, researchers identified patterns linked to motivation, focus, and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns were consistent across species, suggesting a shared link between facial expression and cognition. If similar findings hold in humans, this method could revolutionize diagnostics in ADHD, autism, and dementia by objectively measuring attention and other mental states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Species Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Facial expressions reflect similar internal cognitive states in both mice and macaques.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific facial patterns can forecast how quickly and accurately animals complete tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to new diagnostic tools for non-verbal conditions like autism, ADHD, or dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether you are solving a puzzle, navigating a shopping center or writing an email: How well you do will not only depend on the task at hand but also on your internal cognitive state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Motivated, focused, restless, confident, or insecure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute in Frankfurt have now shown that such cognitive states can be identified from facial expressions — and can even be used to accurately predict how quickly and successfully a task will be solved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111079"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg" alt="This shows a woman pulling different facial expressions." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study thus also shows how facial expressions can be used as objective measures of internal states, allowing conclusions to be drawn about thought processes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this works across species – more specifically, macaques and mice. In both species, facial expressions not only express emotional states, but also latent cognitive processes in a measurable way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cognitive states are similar across species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal behaviour, for example when searching for food, is largely influenced by internal cognitive states such as attention or motivation to find food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was therefore to better describe functional aspects of cognitive processes and to analyze whether latent cognitive states are similar across species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, the researchers had macaques and mice perform a naturalistic foraging task in a specially developed virtual reality environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide range of facial expressions were recorded, which were then used in a statistical model and further computer simulations to identify a series of latent states that accurately predict when the animals will respond to the stimuli shown and how well they will solve the search task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the identified states and task performance is comparable between species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each cognitive state corresponds to a characteristic pattern of facial features that also overlaps between species,” said postdoctoral researcher Alejandro Tlaie Boria, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”This means that facial expressions can be considered a reliable manifestation of internal cognitive states even across species boundaries.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Facial expressions provide insight into thought processes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study thus also shows how facial expressions can be used as objective measures of internal states, allowing conclusions to be drawn about thought processes. This is already directly relevant for research on animal models and could represent a breakthrough for comparative neuroscience and behavioral research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chances for ADHD, autism, and dementia research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the results can be transferred to human facial expressions remains to be investigated. However, if they are confirmed for humans, the findings could become relevant for applications in psychiatry and in autism and dementia research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approaches could be used to recognize latent cognitive states in non-verbal individuals, such as in cases of autism or locked-in syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective measurement of attention states also offers significant potential for improvement in ADHD diagnostics, for example to quantify severity or to identify specific cognitive patterns that can be assigned to ADHD subtypes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this facial expression and cognitive state research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Andrea Knierriem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Andrea Knierriem – Max Planck Society&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60296-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Inferring internal states across mice and monkeys using facial features&lt;/a&gt;” by Alejandro Tlaie Boria et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inferring internal states across mice and monkeys using facial features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal behaviour is shaped to a large degree by internal cognitive states, but it is unknown whether these states are similar across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, here we develop a virtual reality setup in which male mice and macaques engage in the same naturalistic visual foraging task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We exploit the richness of a wide range of facial features extracted from video recordings during the task, to train a Markov-Switching Linear Regression (MSLR). By doing so, we identify, on a single-trial basis, a set of internal states that reliably predicts when the animals are going to react to the presented stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the model is trained purely on reaction times, it can also predict task outcome, supporting the behavioural relevance of the inferred states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship of the identified states to task performance is comparable between mice and monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, each state corresponds to a characteristic pattern of facial features that partially overlaps between species, highlighting the importance of facial expressions as manifestations of internal cognitive states across species.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:26:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE0xcVd5dFBrZ2dqY2VyNENjTWN2OWIzckRoSVk5MUgxbXNmTFFQNEtQVVR5clBqT3lYV1BwZzRxUGxPME4wb1owSm54d0ZqRG42UDFYUFJPTXdtTWR0ZW1PQm02R2JDR3JvRVdTNGVSY3VZbUd4X0Vldm5R</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现锻炼创造了可以逆转肌肉和骨骼衰老的“青春分子” -研究发现 | Scientists Discover Exercise Creates 'Youth Molecule' That Could Reverse Aging In Muscles And Bones - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNckxXYVJrTEpzajBRUEFyM044VEVyNlhTUUVwMjN0azhNM0JoZXRrYzZZTE0yNHdqQTdLTml5VVRvUXNCSkxfZlNRclpwckQyUnpoNF84TnlZWnpwWWRUbFBsMTFRR2ZWQWlHOVRxWTJHUlYtVzRMN1R0Q3J0S19fUHBsN3lGZV8yRFVaZkRvaHNWdTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="" alt="Older Man Doing Push Ups In Gym" data-lazy-src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AdobeStock_26381672-1200x800.jpeg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AdobeStock_26381672-1200x800.jpeg" alt="Older Man Doing Push Ups In Gym"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;(© Monkey Business  - stock.adobe.com)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise releases a protein called CLCF1 that acts like an anti-aging molecule for muscles and bones&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age, but resistance training and high-intensity exercise can restore them&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When scientists blocked this protein in mice, exercise lost most of its muscle and bone strengthening benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAEJEON, South Korea —&lt;/strong&gt; There may really be no better “fountain of youth” remedy than a good old-fashioned workout. Research out of South Korea reveals that when you exercise, your muscles release a powerful protein that acts like a biological time machine, potentially reversing age-related decline in both muscle and bone strength.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have identified that the molecule &lt;em&gt;cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1&lt;/em&gt; (CLCF1) surges through the bloodstream during workouts, particularly resistance training. This protein appears to reverse some aspects of age-related decline. The discovery could explain why some 80-year-olds can outperform sedentary 40-year-olds, and it might lead to new treatments for age-related &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/muscle-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59959-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shows that CLCF1 levels naturally decline as we age, but exercise can restore them to youthful levels. When researchers gave this protein to elderly mice, the animals regained muscle strength and bone density that rivaled much younger mice. Even more striking: when scientists blocked the protein’s activity, exercise lost most of its &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-aging benefits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-your-muscles-talk-to-your-bones-during-exercise"&gt;How Your Muscles Talk to Your Bones During Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 belongs to a family of proteins called &lt;em&gt;myokines&lt;/em&gt;, which are chemical messengers that muscles release during physical activity. Myokines act like your muscle’s way of sending text messages to the rest of your body about what’s happening during exercise. Some messages tell fat cells to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/morning-exercise-burning-calories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burn more energy&lt;/a&gt;, others instruct bones to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/lifting-weights-vegans-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;get stronger&lt;/a&gt;, and some even reach your brain to improve mood and memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 appears especially important because it targets both muscle and bone simultaneously. As we age, both tissues typically weaken together, a process that can lead to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/frailty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;, falls, and fractures. One molecule addressing both problems makes it particularly intriguing from a treatment standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by scientists in South Korea, first discovered CLCF1’s importance by analyzing gene activity in muscle samples from people of different ages before and after exercise training. They found that while young people naturally produced plenty of CLCF1 during workouts, older adults made much less of it. Declining CLCF1 levels might be a key reason why exercise becomes less effective at maintaining muscle and bone health as we age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laboratory-studies-show-dramatic-results"&gt;Laboratory Studies Show Dramatic Results&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test their theory, researchers conducted experiments with both cells in laboratory dishes and live mice. They treated muscle cells with CLCF1 and found that the protein supercharged the cells’ energy production, particularly their ability to burn glucose for fuel. Aging muscles often struggle to efficiently use energy, contributing to weakness and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team gave CLCF1 injections to 20-month-old mice (roughly equivalent to 80-year-old humans), the results were dramatic. After just two weeks of treatment, the elderly mice showed significant improvements in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/grip-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;grip strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/2d4d-ring-finger-length-endurance-running/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;running endurance&lt;/a&gt;. Their muscle fibers grew larger, and their bones became denser and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Muscle analysis revealed that CLCF1 activated several important cellular pathways involved in muscle growth and energy production. The protein particularly boosted glycolysis, which is the process cells use to quickly generate energy from sugar. This helps explain why CLCF1 might be especially important during high-intensity exercise, when muscles need rapid bursts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 also proved to be a powerful &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/prunes-keeps-bone-disease-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The protein worked by suppressing osteoclasts (cells that break down old bone tissue) while promoting osteoblasts, the cells that build new bone. This dual action led to increased bone volume and thickness in the treated mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-engineered-mice-reveal-exercise-s-secret"&gt;Engineered Mice Reveal Exercise’s Secret&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other experiments, researchers created mice that overproduced CLCF1 throughout their lives. These mice showed enhanced muscle function and stronger bones even without extra exercise. They had better grip strength, could hang from grids longer, and ran farther on treadmills compared to normal mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also conducted the opposite experiment: they blocked CLCF1 activity in mice during exercise training. When they gave mice a protein called &lt;em&gt;eCNTFR&lt;/em&gt; that neutralizes CLCF1, exercise lost most of its beneficial effects on both muscle and bone. The mice could still run on treadmills, but they didn’t gain the usual improvements in strength, endurance, or bone density.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, CLCF1 is actually doing much of the heavy lifting when it comes to exercise’s anti-aging benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-evidence-points-to-similar-effects"&gt;Human Evidence Points to Similar Effects&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mouse studies were impressive, but do these results apply to humans? The researchers examined blood samples from people of various ages and exercise habits to find out. They discovered that circulating CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age in humans, just as they do in mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, exercise could reverse this decline. When young adults performed resistance training or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hiit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-intensity interval workouts&lt;/a&gt;, their blood CLCF1 levels increased significantly. Older adults who participated in 12-16 week resistance training programs also saw their CLCF1 levels rise, though the response was somewhat reduced compared to younger people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Different types of exercise produced different responses. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/resistance-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Resistance training&lt;/a&gt; and high-intensity intervals boosted CLCF1 levels, but moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like casual treadmill walking) did not. CLCF1 release might require a certain threshold of exercise intensity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these results are exciting, several important limitations should be noted. The human studies involved relatively small groups of participants, and the researchers acknowledge that their human data should be considered “exploratory” and require further investigation. Most of the dramatic &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-aging effects&lt;/a&gt; were demonstrated in mice, not humans. While mice are excellent models for studying basic biological processes, findings don’t always translate perfectly to humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we’re still years away from CLCF1-based therapies, these results reinforce the profound importance of staying physically active throughout life. They suggest that resistance training and high-intensity exercise might be particularly powerful tools &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. For now, the best way to boost your CLCF1 levels is the old-fashioned way: hit the weights, push your limits, and let your muscles work their molecular magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed gene expression data from human muscle samples before and after exercise to identify age-related changes in myokine production. They then conducted laboratory experiments with mouse muscle cells and performed multiple studies with young (3-month-old) and aged (18-24-month-old) mice. Some mice received CLCF1 injections, others had the protein’s activity blocked, and some were genetically modified to overproduce CLCF1. The team measured muscle strength through grip tests and treadmill running, analyzed muscle fiber size through microscopic examination, and assessed bone density using micro-CT scanning. They also collected blood samples from human participants of various ages before and after different exercise programs to measure circulating CLCF1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age in both humans and mice, but exercise training can restore them. In aged mice, CLCF1 treatment improved grip strength, running endurance, muscle fiber size, and bone density. The protein enhanced cellular energy production, particularly glucose metabolism, and activated pathways involved in muscle growth. For bones, CLCF1 suppressed bone-destroying cells while promoting bone-building cells. Mice genetically engineered to overproduce CLCF1 showed enhanced physical performance, while blocking CLCF1 activity eliminated most of exercise’s beneficial effects. In humans, resistance training and high-intensity exercise increased blood CLCF1 levels, but moderate aerobic exercise did not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human studies involved relatively small sample sizes and should be considered exploratory. Most dramatic anti-aging effects were demonstrated in mice, and findings may not fully translate to humans. The research focused primarily on resistance and high-intensity exercise, leaving questions about other forms of physical activity. Some human cohort baseline CLCF1 levels varied significantly between groups, particularly in elite athletes, which may have influenced results. The muscle-specific knockout experiments showed less pronounced effects than expected, suggesting other cell types may also contribute to CLCF1 production during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

Her condition continued to decline. Muñoz had a heart attack, struggled with an internal hemorrhage, and developed &lt;a href="https://people.com/flesh-eating-bacteria-survivor-finds-new-purpose-outdoors-8659463" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:necrotizing fasciitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt; — commonly called the flesh-eating bacteria — which resulted in the amputation of her legs under the knee, her right arm, and part of her left hand, to stop the infection’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw my arms and legs: darkness.

I can't take care of my children 100%," Muñoz told ABC. As she shared in the GoFundMe, she now desperately needs prosthetics to properly look after “my two sons, Matthew and Enrique, who are autistic and who have relied heavily on me in terms of care, as well as to be present at their therapy, evaluation and medical appointments. Now, during this trying time, I desire nothing more than to continue to care for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, she's managing as best as she can, she told ABC: "I can eat [by] myself and brush my teeth by myself," Muñoz said. “I can push myself out of the bed on my side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as she shared, “I’m grateful because I’m alive and I can stay with my kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-amputation-flesh-eating-disease-two-sons-autism-11758481" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:55:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE4xNnBNRWE4eVVWdHNMMU12UXF1VUxlUE1SYmNiMm1oQldtem0zNlM3d3Y1eElXSGltNS11U0lOX0ZMaVlHdE9yUDZLZFZVNHNTRXk2ZnJJWEkzemh4ajhTNVFidE5RdFl0SlE</guid></item><item><title>科学家表示，性药物伟哥具有令人惊讶的新健康益处，可以帮助300万英国老年人- the-sun.com | Sex drug Viagra has surprising new health benefit and could help 3 million ageing Brits, say scientists - the-sun.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPRlEzbENPUE5Dc0NoS3NSV2pWVENmWXZ3SjZDZDlzRXFNVDBObzNRU1VpYkNaZnBuYmxBaHV2cjBtM0xtQXJmZWhuQmVoYU0tWW9TNEdxZ1c3dFRKLW1mUU9weW96YzFhTHc3WnFvMkZZc2ZaMnFWRGVQcmxaX1R0MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEX aid pill Viagra helps stiffen your skeleton, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little blue tablet was found to increase production of vital bone cells — so could one day prevent back pain and fractures in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-container-placeholder lazyload" data-name="news" data-value="The US Sun" data-login-link="https://login.the-sun.com" data-isgeneric="true" data-widget-name="newsletter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found sildenafil, which is branded as &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/11921920/record-amounts-viagra-prescribed-nhs/" rel=""&gt;Viagra&lt;/a&gt;, helped human stem cells transform into osteoblasts, the bone-building cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are vital as the human skeleton regenerates and is completely replaced roughly once every ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, we lose more bone than we build, increasing the risk of breaks or osteoporosis, which makes bones brittle and painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Peking University team’s follow-up tests on mice also suggested sildenafil would prevent bone loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Menglong Hu and Dr Likun Wu said: “Our findings offer new insights into the physiological effects of the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sildenafil enhanced stem cell osteogenic differentiation and inhibited bone loss ­— it may usefully treat osteoporosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than three million Britons suffer &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/13791645/how-to-protect-bones-osteoporosis-fractures/" rel=""&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.

In acute pain, neurons in the medullary dorsal horn reduce their activity through a natural “braking” system involving A-type potassium currents, helping limit pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in chronic pain, this mechanism fails, and the neurons become overactive, continuing to send pain messages. This discovery provides a clearer biological pathway for how pain becomes chronic and may guide future therapies aimed at restoring this internal regulation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstem Relay Dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; In chronic pain, neurons in the medullary dorsal horn lose their ability to dampen pain signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-Type Potassium Current (IA):&lt;/strong&gt; This current acts as a brake in acute pain but fails to activate in chronic pain conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Implication:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting IA could be a novel strategy to prevent or treat chronic pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does some pain go away while other types linger, turning into chronic suffering? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study from scientists at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem may have uncovered part of the answer — deep inside the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111075"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In acute pain, IA increases — acting like a natural sedative for the pain pathways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published this week in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, researchers led by Doctoral student Ben Title under the guidance of Prof. Alexander M. Binshtok from The Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine and the Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC) at The Hebrew University, reveal that our bodies respond to acute (short-term) and chronic (long-lasting) pain in surprisingly different ways at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discovery sheds new light on how pain becomes chronic — and opens the door to better-targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brain’s “Pain Relays” Behave Differently in Acute vs. Chronic Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team studied a small but crucial region in the brainstem called the medullary dorsal horn, home to neurons that act as a relay station for pain signals. These projection neurons help send pain messages from the body to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that during acute inflammatory pain, these neurons actually dial down their own activity. This built-in “braking system” helps limit the amount of pain-related signals sent to the brain. Once the inflammation and pain subside, the neurons return to their normal state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in chronic pain, this braking system fails. The neurons don’t reduce their activity — in fact, they become more excitable and fire more signals, potentially contributing to the persistence of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Key Player: A-Type Potassium Current&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of electrophysiology and computer modeling, the researchers identified a key mechanism: a specific potassium current known as the A-type potassium current (IA). This current helps regulate the excitability of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In acute pain, IA increases — acting like a natural sedative for the pain pathways. But in chronic pain, this current doesn’t ramp up, and the neurons become hyperactive. The absence of this regulation may be one of the biological switches that turns temporary pain into a long-lasting condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Chronic Pain Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve seen how the same neurons behave so differently in acute versus chronic pain,” said Prof. Binshtok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that this natural ‘calming’ mechanism is missing in chronic pain suggests a new target for therapy. If we can find a way to restore or mimic that braking system, we might be able to prevent pain from becoming chronic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Step Toward Smarter Pain Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain affects over 50 million people in the U.S. alone, often with few effective treatment options. This new study adds an important piece to the puzzle by showing how the nervous system’s built-in pain controls are disrupted in long-term pain conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By understanding the brain’s own strategies for limiting pain — and why they sometimes fail — scientists are now one step closer to developing smarter, more precise therapies for those who suffer from chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8eeaefe0efebe3edcefdeff8e7e1e0a0e6fbe4e7a0efeda0e7e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danae Marx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://huji.ac.il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Danae Marx – Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr3467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Opposite regulation of medullary pain-related projection neuron excitability in acute and chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexander M.
