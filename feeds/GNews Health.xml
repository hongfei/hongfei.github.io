&lt;p&gt;Let’s be real: most of us don’t look our best after a night of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/16/health/study-findings-about-binge-drinking/"&gt;heavy drinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when one man woke up with a swollen face and puffy eyelids, he figured he was just paying the price of partying. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t last night’s liquor coming back to haunt him. Instead, it was a rare and deadly heart condition — and one well-intentioned mistake nearly cost him his life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Drinking alcohol can put stress on the heart, especially with heavy or excessive consumption. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Three months, no answers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the swelling didn’t let up, the 33-year-old Chinese man sought medical help — but doctors came up empty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial testing found no problems with his heart, but doctors noticed that he had unusually high levels of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/15/lifestyle/i-followed-trendy-carnivore-diet-and-ended-up-in-the-hospital-with-kidney-stones-this-was-my-daily-diet/"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; in his urine. They suspected that might explain the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/26/health/avoid-this-food-to-reduce-face-puffiness-according-to-dietitians/"&gt;puffiness in his face&lt;/a&gt;, handed him a prescription and sent him home.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;But his condition only got worse. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Soon, the swelling spread from his face to the rest of his body. His chest began to tighten. His abdomen swelled. And still, no one had a clear answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After bouncing from appointment to appointment, he was finally admitted to the emergency room at Qilu Hospital in Qingdao — three months after the symptoms first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s when doctors finally uncovered the real cause: a ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (RSOVA) — a rare and potentially deadly heart condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-025-05143-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Medical Case Reports&lt;/a&gt;, doctors wrote that they believe the rupture was likely triggered by “strenuous exercise” after drinking alcohol, which caused the face of the “previously healthy” man to swell. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Something to think about before hitting the gym &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/03/health/dietitian-reveals-what-to-eat-and-drink-to-cure-a-hangover/"&gt;hungover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Patients with a Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm should avoid strenuous activities that could increase the risk of rupture.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Drazen – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A heart on the brink&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms are rare, affecting just 0.09% of the population. Most people don’t know they have one until it ruptures, often triggered by activities like vigorous &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/04/lifestyle/doctor-reveals-the-disgustingly-small-amount-of-exercise-someone-needs-each-day-to-help-slashes-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; or heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When that rupture happens, symptoms can vary wildly: from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/12/health/my-chest-pains-turned-out-to-be-flesh-eating-bug-i-was-minutes-away-from-dying/"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; and shortness of breath to fainting, fatigue — or, in this man’s case, a slow, creeping full-body swell.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Left untreated, RSOVA often leads to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/health/cardiologist-warns-commonly-prescribed-drug-is-toxic-for-heart/"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and death within a year. But with early diagnosis and surgical repair, the long-term survival rate is typically strong.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors who eventually diagnosed the 33-year-old patient said that earlier health care providers missed several “key indicators” — including a rumbling sound in the heartbeat that can be a sign of a rupture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;When the aneurysm ruptures, patients often experience sudden severe chest pain.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Anciens – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That misdiagnosis, they wrote, “delayed appropriate intervention” and allowed the patient’s condition to worsen, posing a “serious risk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the time he arrived at the emergency department at Qilu Hospital, his symptoms had escalated to full-blown acute &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/06/08/heart-failure-can-be-cured-with-natural-survivor-antibodies/"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Further testing identified an aneurysm that was affecting one of the heart’s four chambers — and doctors rushed him into emergency surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the rupture was successfully repaired, and 18 months later, the patient is recovering well with no complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their report, doctors said the case highlights why medical teams should be quicker to consider RSOVA in younger patients presenting with signs of heart failure — a condition that’s typically affects older adults. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is therefore important to develop a strategy for the early recognition of aortic sinus aneurysm rupture,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

A new study has uncovered that additional genetic players, particularly the &lt;em&gt;Commander&lt;/em&gt; gene complex, influence whether the disease manifests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using CRISPR interference to screen the entire genome, scientists identified how Commander proteins impact lysosomal function — a key cellular recycling system tied to Parkinson’s pathology. These findings not only clarify disease mechanisms but also introduce new targets for potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commander Genes Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; A set of 16 Commander proteins helps regulate lysosomal function, influencing Parkinson’s disease development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR-Based Screening:&lt;/strong&gt; Genome-wide CRISPR interference revealed which genes modulate GCase activity and Parkinson’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Drug Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing Commander protein function may offer a therapeutic route to restore lysosomal health and slow neurodegeneration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A longstanding mystery in Parkinson’s disease research has been why some individuals carrying pathogenic variants that increase their risk of PD go on to develop the disease, while others who also carry such variants do not. The prevailing theory has suggested additional genetic factors may play a role.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, a new study from Northwestern Medicine used modern technology, called CRISPR interference, to systematically examine every gene in the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108653"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-genetics-crispr-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Future research will need to determine the extent to which the Commander complex plays a role in other neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit lysosomal dysfunction. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists identified a new set of genes that contribute to the risk of Parkinson’s disease, which opens the door to previously untapped drug targets for treating PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 10 million people worldwide are living with PD, the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published April 10 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study reveals that a combination of genetic factors plays a role in the manifestation of diseases like Parkinson’s disease, which means that therapeutic targeting of several key pathways will have to be considered for such disorders,” said corresponding author Dr. Dimitri Krainc, chair of Davee department of neurology and director of the Feinberg Neuroscience Institute at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also is possible to identify such genetic factors in susceptible individuals by studying tens of thousands of patients, which is challenging and costly,” Krainc said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, we used a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen to silence each of the protein-coding human genes in cells and identified those important for PD pathogenesis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variants in Commander genes contribute to PD &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study discovered that a group of 16 proteins, called Commander, comes together to play a previously unrecognized role in delivering specific proteins to the lysosome, a part of the cell that acts like a recycling center, breaking down waste materials, old cell parts and other unwanted substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found the greatest risk factor for developing Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is carrying a pathogenic variant in the &lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; gene. These harmful variants reduce the activity of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which is important for cells’ recycling process in lysosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it has been unknown why some people who carry pathogenic GBA1 variants develop PD whereas others do not. To address this, the current study identified Commander complex genes and corresponding proteins that modulate GCase activity specifically in the lysosome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By examining the genomes from two independent cohorts (the UK Biobank and AMP-PD), the scientists found loss-of-function variants in Commander genes in people with PD compared to those without it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that loss-of-function variants in these genes increase Parkinson’s disease risk,” Krainc said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New drug targets to improve lysosomal function &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lysosomal dysfunction — or when a cell’s recycling system malfunctions — is a common feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, including PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reveals that the Commander complex plays an important role in maintaining lysosomal function, suggesting that drugs that help Commander proteins work better might also improve the cell’s recycling system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to determine the extent to which the Commander complex plays a role in other neurodegenerative disorders that exhibit lysosomal dysfunction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If Commander dysfunction is observed in these individuals, drugs that target Commander could hold broader therapeutic potential for treating disorders with lysosomal dysfunction,” Krainc said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this context, Commander-targeting drugs could also complement other PD treatments, such as therapies aiming to increase lysosomal GCase activity, as potential combinatorial therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other Northwestern authors include first co-authors postdoctoral fellow Georgia Minakaki and research assistant professor of neurology Nathaniel Safren, as well as postdoctoral fellow Bernabe I. Bustos, and assistant professor of neurology Dr. Niccolo Mencacci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this study was provided by Research Program Award (R35).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and Parkinson’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e08b93818d95858c938f8ea08e8f9294889785939485928ece858495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kristin Samuelson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kristin Samuelson – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adq6650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Commander complex regulates lysosomal function and is implicated in Parkinson’s disease risk&lt;/a&gt;” by Dimitri Krainc et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commander complex regulates lysosomal function and is implicated in Parkinson’s disease risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variants in &lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; resulting in decreased lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity are a common risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Incomplete penetrance of &lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; variants suggests that additional genes contribute to PD and DLB manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using a pooled genome-wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified copper metabolism MURR1 domain–containing 3 (COMMD3) protein, a component of the COMMD/coiled-coil domain–containing protein 22 (CCDC22)/CCDC93 (CCC) and Commander complexes, as a modifier of GCase and lysosomal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss of COMMD3 increased the release of lysosomal proteins through extracellular vesicles, leading to their impaired delivery to endolysosomes and consequent lysosomal dysfunction. Rare variants in the Commander gene family were associated with increased PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, COMMD genes and related complexes regulate lysosomal homeostasis and may represent modifiers in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with lysosomal dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 13:47:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBiQVJDQ0JPelc1RGd1dmtLMlV0RFZ2WE5vcnhGcWFRTHA0NEUwSDV4d2pwdkFRUmZYNDJNUmp2TDRMVm1fdndUV3dLWHJzOG1PMERTZGxDS3ktX2MxQUJCVmttSnYzSHdXcjBZM0J3</guid></item><item><title>How Childhood Abuse Impacts Parental Empathy - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFBfeW1MWFJzT1RHU01aOGtSS3ZQd1hMTFhsVm9LenpOMHNfN0t0eFNUWTBNS1NsdzJsTkxPcDNWRlItVVRCaXBPeFFURy1oY0lqZWd4UGR4aThnTFFmT2VNdFYtN1FCV0J2ZFdfSWV1VTc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study sheds light on how childhood maltreatment can lead to impaired empathy and increased risk of child abuse in adulthood. Researchers found that mothers who experienced abuse as children often struggle with emotional empathy and depressive symptoms, both of which negatively influence parenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional overwhelm from their children’s feelings can increase stress, making them more likely to perpetuate the cycle of abuse.

In fact, children who experience abuse tend to have reduced empathy by the age of eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lack of empathy can persist into adulthood, making it difficult for them to provide the care and emotional support their children need, thus increasing the risk of CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a recent study led by researchers from the University of Fukui, Japan, provides new insights into this complex issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in Volume 15 in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; on March 5, 2025, the study compared mothers who engage in maltreatment with those who do not, examining how their experiences of CM impact their ability to empathize, manage stress, and raise their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings highlight possible ways to break the cycle of abuse through targeted interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted by Graduate Student Yuko Kawaguchi along with Assistant Professor Shota Nishitani, Associate Professor Takashi X. Fujisawa, and Professor Akemi Tomoda from the University of Fukui, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to us about the rationale behind this study, Kawaguchi says, “We aimed to not only determine whether mothers engaged in &lt;em&gt;CM in a simplistic ‘either/or’ manner but also to understand the act of maltreatment from a more nuanced, spectrum-based perspective.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the researchers conducted path analysis, a statistical technique that maps and tests relationships between multiple variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared 13 mothers who had experienced childhood abuse and engaged in maltreatment with a control group of 42 mothers who had no such history, examining how factors such as CM, empathy, and depressive symptoms influence parenting styles in both groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a combination of psychological assessments and physiological measures to evaluate these factors. CM was assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) questionnaire and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy was measured using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and parenting styles were assessed using the Parenting Scale (PS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed significant differences between the two groups. Mothers who had experienced CM scored higher on measures of childhood trauma, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect. These factors, in turn, increased their risk of engaging in CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the researchers observed a significant positive correlation between the total CTQ score and affective empathy (IRI measure) and between affective empathy, particularly personal distress, and depressive symptoms (SDS score).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that CM indirectly increases the risk of abusive parenting by influencing the mothers’ emotional empathy and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, parents who experienced CM themselves were more likely to feel overwhelmed by their children’s emotions, making them prone to depressive symptoms and increasing their risk of engaging in maltreatment, thereby perpetuating the cycle of intergenerational abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research reveals that a history of abuse enhances emotional empathy, which in turn, influences parenting through its impact on depression,” says Kawaguchi, while elaborating on the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By addressing emotional empathy and depression, we can help break this cycle and prevent maltreatment from being passed down to the next generation,” she adds&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interventions to achieve this can include mental health support to mothers who have experienced CM and parenting programs that help mothers manage their emotional empathy effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, integrating insights from this study into parenting education, child welfare, and mental health interventions can foster healthier and more positive parent-child relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;All phases of this study were supported by AMED (20gk0110052, AT and SN), JSPS KAKENHI Scientific Research (A) (19H00617 and 22H00492, AT), (C) 22K02432 (SK and SN), and University of Fukui Research Farm Firm, University of Fukui (SK), a research grant from the Strategic Budget to Realize University Missions (AT), a Grant-in-Aid for Translational Research from the Life Science Innovation Center, University of Fukui (AT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this childhood trauma and empathy research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99eaeaf2f6f1f6b4f2d9f8fdb7ecb4ffecf2ecf0b7f8fab7f3e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Naoki Tsukamoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://u-fukui.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Fukui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Naoki Tsukamoto – University of Fukui&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-92804-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of childhood maltreatment on mothers’ empathy and parenting styles in intergenerational transmission&lt;/a&gt;” by Yuko Kawaguchi et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of childhood maltreatment on mothers’ empathy and parenting styles in intergenerational transmission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the intergenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment (CM) is crucial to prevent its perpetuation to future generations. The literature has revealed parental empathy to be a pivotal factor in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parental empathy is the ability to comprehend and empathetically respond to the emotions and mental states of children; therefore, its impairment may result in challenges in parenting, ultimately contributing to CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the factors that undermine empathy and how they alter parenting practices, to uncover the process of intergenerational transmission of CM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate actual instances of CM, a comparative study was conducted between 13 mothers with a history of social interventions owing to CM and 42 mothers in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Path analysis was performed to examine the trajectory from adverse childhood experiences to maltreatment and explore their correlations with variables including affective and cognitive empathy, depressive symptoms, and parenting styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that experiences of CM specifically enhanced empathy in the emotional domain in the maltreatment group. Furthermore, heightened empathy in the maltreatment group influenced parenting style mediated by depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results provide important insights into the intergenerational transmission process in the context of parental empathy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 13:22:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBfeW1MWFJzT1RHU01aOGtSS3ZQd1hMTFhsVm9LenpOMHNfN0t0eFNUWTBNS1NsdzJsTkxPcDNWRlItVVRCaXBPeFFURy1oY0lqZWd4UGR4aThnTFFmT2VNdFYtN1FCV0J2ZFdfSWV1VTc</guid></item><item><title>Predatory journals even worse since "Get Me Off Your F*ck*ng Mailing List" was accepted for publication - Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 12:59:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>What Autistic Women Want You to Know About Motherhood - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE8za0xMeTJBOExSME1YcHVXTklQZnRXd2tTM3NtVGpiZFZBb3dtc1VkdV91QkJoQTR2MXUyaGpUUVY5VnA2VVFrR09xeGNSTDNJWldtWEVFRXBULTNScWxfVkxjbzRYd1NLVUNOSnRmQjlvdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research highlights the unique challenges and needs faced by autistic women during motherhood, including late diagnoses and a lack of professional understanding. Many participants were only diagnosed after their children, reflecting gaps in awareness and support from both family and healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory sensitivities, anxiety, and intensified emotional experiences were also reported throughout pregnancy and parenting. Participants emphasized the need for tailored care and greater societal awareness to improve outcomes for autistic mothers and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; Many autistic women were diagnosed only after their children received an autism diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Amplification:&lt;/strong&gt; Motherhood intensified sensory sensitivities and anxiety for many participants.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support Gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a lack of trained healthcare professionals and adapted care protocols for autistic mothers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Universitat Jaume I&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An article of the Universitat Jaume I of Castelló published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Autism in adulthood&lt;/em&gt; has collected some of the needs detected in autistic women regarding motherhood, among them, the shortage of professionals with updated knowledge to identify autism and provide a better individualised attention or the convenience of a family and social support network that favours the transition to the experience of being mothers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article “Until I had my son, I did not realise that these characteristics could be due to autism: motherhood and family experiences of Spanish autistic mothers”, signed by the lecturer and researcher Irene García Molina and the Master’s student in Family Intervention and Mediation Mónica Cortés Calvo, collects the experience of nine Spanish autistic women, seven mothers and two who want to become mothers, aged between 29 and 58, who responded in an interview to open questions about motherhood and life as a couple, which were evaluated under a qualitative approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108645"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows moms and babies." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-motherhood-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They also stressed the importance of greater awareness of the characteristics of autism in women and in motherhood, so that the family can provide greater care and support, and at the same time, hospital protocols for pregnant autistic women can be adapted. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selection of the participants was made through five of the most important autism foundations in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The themes that most interviewees agreed on were related to the need for healthcare professionals who can identify autism, as most of them were diagnosed after their children or another family member was diagnosed (and in some cases, the family doubted the diagnosis, believing that the mother was seeking attention).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also emphasized the importance of a good family relationship (partner and children) during the diagnosis process to increase self-acceptance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other aspects that most concerned the women about motherhood were the influence of sensory reactivity and anxiety because they saw many aspects of their motherhood and their relationships intensified, from pregnancy to more intimate experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also stressed the importance of greater awareness of the characteristics of autism in women and in motherhood, so that the family can provide greater care and support, and at the same time, hospital protocols for pregnant autistic women can be adapted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the opinion of the researchers, “it is important to collaborate with different groups in researching these issues (women, family and health professionals) to understand their priorities and offer them more personalised care, from pregnancy to parenting”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, they stress, “more research is needed to break down the barriers surrounding the intersection of motherhood and diversity and to offer greater understanding and acceptance to the people who interact with them”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the sample, although not representative of the population of autistic mothers due to the number of interviews, serve as a starting point for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have not found any previous research on the experiences and needs of autistic Spanish women who are or want to become mothers and their relationships with their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those that exist are focused on children or are from countries with a different culture to the Spanish one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The project “Autistic mothers: pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding and parenting: motherhood in autistic women” has been possible thanks to the funding of the Social Commitment Award of the Santander Bank and the Universitat Jaume I of Castelló in 2022. Professor García Molina, member of the research group DEVELOP (Development and Educational Contexts), continues with the research on this topic, focused on mothers with autism and their families, as well as health professionals in the province of Castelló. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism and motherhood research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a0e031c1f060d0b1f00032a1f0003440f19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mari Luz Blanco Burgueño&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uji.es" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Universitat Jaume I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Mari Luz Blanco Burgueño – Universitat Jaume I&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/aut.2023.0013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Until I had my son, I did not realise that these characteristics could be due to autism: motherhood and family experiences of Spanish autistic mothers&lt;/a&gt;” by Irene García-Molina et al. &lt;em&gt;Autism in Adulthood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until I had my son, I did not realise that these characteristics could be due to autism: motherhood and family experiences of Spanish autistic mothers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is sparse regarding the motherhood experiences and family relationships of autistic women. Few studies use a qualitative approach to afford autistic mothers (and want-to-be-mothers) a voice. This is an analysis of the experiences of Spanish autistic mothers presented from their perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine autistic mothers responded to open-ended questions and verbalized their experiences of maternity and family relationships in writing or orally. Data obtained were analyzed using a qualitative thematic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed four main themes about the participants’ experiences: (1) autistic mothers were diagnosed after their autistic children (or close relatives) received their diagnosis; (2) role of the nuclear family (partner and children); (3) the influence of sensory processing on coexistence with the partner, and upbringing of the children, of autistic mothers; and (4) the influence of anxiety on coexistence with the partner, and upbringing of the children, of autistic mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their experiences showed that the mother’s autism diagnosis can follow the diagnosis of an autistic child and highlighted the importance of a good relationship with their partners and children during the process, increasing their self-acceptance (Themes 1 and 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the influence of sensory reactivity and anxiety intensified many aspects of their maternity and relations, from pregnancy to intimate experiences (Themes 3 and 4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there is a need for greater understanding and awareness about the characteristics of autistic mothers in the Spanish context, so that family members or health care professionals could provide better individualized care for them—from their pregnancy to the upbringing of their children.&lt;/p&gt;

with your coffee, here are a few sweetener alternatives recommended by experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian nutritionist Ilana Muhlstein, based in Los Angeles, shared some creative ways to sweeten your coffee naturally, including making your own nut milk at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Making your own nut milk "really makes you question why most store-bought versions come with six or more ingredients," said a dietitian nutritionist.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's amazing how simply blending almonds or cashews with water can produce a rich, creamy and completely clean plant-based milk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really makes you question why most store-bought versions come with six or more ingredients — many of which are gums, oils and added sugars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/coffee-creamer-products-recalled-complaints-spoilage-illness" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Coffee Creamer Products Recalled After 'Complaints Of Spoilage And Illness';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coffee Creamer Products Recalled After 'Complaints Of Spoilage And Illness'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nutritionist added, "Just as people started realizing that nut butters should only contain nuts (and maybe salt), it's time we question what's lurking in our alt milks, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to sweeten coffee naturally is with cinnamon, which adds a "warm, subtly sweet flavor," Muhlstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon is also a "powerhouse spice," she said; it's packed with polyphenols that can help combat oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Cinnamon is a "powerhouse spice" that can help reduce oxidative stress and support healthy blood sugar.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plus, cinnamon may help enhance GLUT4 expression, which supports healthy blood sugar levels by moving more glucose into your cells," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeCicco shared a recipe for frothed, grass-fed half-and-half with cinnamon and hazelnut extract, explaining how half-and-half is a more natural milk option, excluding gums, additives or preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/coffee-costs-content-creator-more-340-got-goosebumps" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Coffee Costs A Content Creator More Than $340: 'Made Me Feel Overwhelmed';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Coffee Costs A Content Creator More Than $340: 'Made Me Feel Overwhelmed'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also has a thick and creamy texture and taste, which works well in a frother," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whenever a milk is frothed-heated, it creates a more creamy texture and brings out its natural sweetness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Grass-fed half-and-half is a healthier option than processed creamers, a dietitian nutritionist told Fox News Digital.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stir in some cinnamon for antioxidants and natural sweetness, DeCicco suggested, followed by some hazelnut extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/bomb-squad-baker-coffee-maker-former-deputy-crushes-business" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:From Bomb Squad To Baker And Coffee Maker: Former Deputy Crushes A New Business;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;From Bomb Squad To Baker And Coffee Maker: Former Deputy Crushes A New Business&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People don't realize just how sweet cinnamon actually is without any sugar," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vietnamese Saigon cinnamon is the sweetest variety and is very medicinal.

Opt for the popular organic brands to make sure there are minimal levels of heavy metals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muhlstein said she also loves putting pure &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vanilla extract;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vanilla extract&lt;/a&gt; in her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just make sure it's the real deal — pure vanilla with nothing but vanilla bean and alcohol," she said. "Imitation versions often contain additives like caramel color and artificial flavorings, which I'd recommend skipping."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to vanilla, adding coconut milk can make for a great naturally sweetened vanilla coconut cream coffee, DeCicco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Coconut milk contains healthy fat that provides energy and can support gut health.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Canned coconut milk is a great option for coffee, as opposed to the 'coconut creamers' that are full of sugar, emulsifiers and gums," she said. "You want at least some real fat in the coconut milk to keep it thick and tasty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coconut milk is a good source of fat that provides energy to the body and is said to support gut health, according to DeCicco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mixing coconut milk with vanilla extract and a tiny bit of a plant-based sweetener makes for a tasty coffee drink," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chocolate is a crave-worthy sweet treat, it can be high in sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mixing pure cacao with coffee can be one way to satisfy cravings in a healthier way, DeCicco recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Raw cacao is "excellent for anti-aging and anti-inflammation."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Try blending up raw cacao powder with coconut oil and a pinch of sea salt for a true coffee dessert," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw cacao powder is "one of the most antioxidant-rich foods on the planet," according to the nutritionist, so it's &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"excellent for anti-aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"excellent for anti-aging&lt;/a&gt; and anti-inflammation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High in fiber, iron and magnesium, it's a true superfood and has a rich yet bitter chocolate taste," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Sweetened coffee is a must for some people, but it could bring some health risks.

			&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-are-better-for-you-than-sugar-scientists-weigh-in"&gt;health effects of artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; are still up for debate, a new study suggests they &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might also be a surprising weapon in the fight against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nightmare-drug-resistant-superbugs-are-causing-more-deaths-than-previously-estimated"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Brunel University in the UK, the researchers behind the study ran controlled lab tests to see how &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin"&gt;saccharin&lt;/a&gt;, a common artificial sweetener, interacted with bacteria. We know the chemical can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13793"&gt;influence gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, including those critical to our health, and the researchers wanted to take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, from a bacteria-bashing perspective, were impressive: saccharin caused serious disruption to the structures of several bacteria strains, inhibiting how easily they grew and multiplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157651" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaDiagram.jpg" alt="Bacteria diagram" class="wp-image-157651 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaDiagram-544x415.jpg 544w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BacteriaDiagram-600x458.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157651" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers found saccharin had a significant effect on bacteria cells. (de Dios et al., &lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've identified a novel antimicrobial – saccharin," &lt;a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Sweetener-saccharin-shows-surprise-power-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ronan McCarthy, microbiologist from Brunel University. "Saccharin breaks the walls of bacterial pathogens, causing them to distort and eventually burst, killing the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Crucially, this damage lets antibiotics slip inside, overwhelming their resistance systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team put saccharin up against some particularly nasty and drug-resistant bacteria, including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the compound's effectiveness varied between bacteria types, these early results are promising, and suggest saccharin could be effective against multiple bacteria strains with some tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In further experiments into saccharin's bug-beating qualities, the researchers also developed a surgical dressing from the artificial sweetener. In lab tests on pig skin, it proved to be more effective than standard wound dressing materials like silver at reducing bacteria levels. It turns out that saccharin is something of a superhero in tackling bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is very exciting," &lt;a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Sweetener-saccharin-shows-surprise-power-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McCarthy. "Normally it takes billions of dollars and decades to develop a new antibiotic. But here we have a compound that's already widely used, and it not only kills drug-resistant bacteria but also makes existing antibiotics more effective."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We urgently need new drugs to treat resistant infections – and saccharin could represent a new therapeutic approach with exciting promise."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-third-leading-cause-of-death-globally-in-2019-was-antibiotic-resistant-bacterial-infection"&gt;antibiotic resistance&lt;/a&gt; are pretty sobering. Bacteria that have evolved to be immune to the best drugs we have are on the rise, and are accounting for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drug-resistant-bacteria-expected-to-kill-tens-of-millions-by-2050"&gt;more and more deaths each year&lt;/a&gt; – with the annual figures now into the millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are making some progress in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-dual-target-drug-could-make-antibiotic-resistance-100-million-times-harder"&gt;fighting the threat&lt;/a&gt; of these superbugs – including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/achilles-heel-of-drug-resistant-bacteria-has-been-found-scientists-say"&gt;finding new vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; that could be used to take down drug-resistant bacteria – the worry is that they're the ones winning the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it's early days, saccharin could be a huge help in catching up, so we need to see how it works in clinical treatments before progress can be made. It's also important to bear in mind &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-what-diet-soft-drink-could-be-doing-to-your-health-in-the-long-term"&gt;the full range of effects&lt;/a&gt; that artificial sweeteners can have on the body, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-artificial-sweeteners-may-have-a-not-so-sweet-impact-on-our-bodies"&gt;may not all be positive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Antibiotic resistance is one of the major threats to modern medicine," &lt;a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Sweetener-saccharin-shows-surprise-power-against-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; McCarthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Procedures such as tooth extractions and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="157648" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatment often rely on antibiotics to prevent or treat infection. But doctors are increasingly facing cases where the drugs no longer work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44321-025-00219-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

If you want the first edition, I will make one final forward on Sunday morning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Send me an email titled, "Hey, Joe, send me that Screencaps newsletter" and I will get it over to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That said, I need you guys to get signed up: &lt;a href="https://www.outkick.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://www.outkick.com/newsletters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yes, I know some of you are saying that the newsletter never arrived. Check those junk folders. The first one will have "Screencaps" in the title to make searching as easy as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for those of you saying you signed up and it never arrived, I will ask T-shirt Manager Olivia G., who handles newsletter technical questions if there's a solution there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, finally, you'll have SeanJo on Monday morning. I will be out of town for about 14 hours for a work trip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I didn't think this post would take off, but it has and people are hammering the inbox with their own takes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven't read the &lt;a href="https://www.outkick.com/culture/rfk-jr-asks-should-disgusting-americans-get-health-care-paid-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;RFK Jr. on doughnuts post&lt;/a&gt;, here it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The premise here is simple: It's time to pump the brakes on ripping doughnuts when we talk about fat ass Americans when there are other consumer items that are way worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Deede agrees, it's time to stop attacking doughnuts: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No, attacking doughnuts is not the answer. We need to start teaching our kids what is healthy and how to cook healthy, tasty food. This needs to start young and continue through high school. I am amazed at the number of people that don't have any idea how to cook, or even make tuna salad. No wonder everyone eats out all of the time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Barbara writes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I think the solution to the obesity problem in the United States should follow the anti-smoking plan. Sugar is an addictive drug and should be labelled as such. You have to start with the children and teach them that sugar equals white death.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Jaime M. has an idea: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sir my suggestion to get America back into shape is to return to the 1950's physical fitness programs in school. If you return to fitness test to graduate high school or atleast requiring physical education courses through out our childrens education which means  kindergarten thru 12 grade. This focus on physical fitness at a young age will bring about a whole family focus on health &amp;amp; health eating habbits. Children will encourage the parents to refocus on health choices for the entire family. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second advertisement the true ingredients &amp;amp; their effects on the body &amp;amp; health effects thru our childrens lives. The disclosure is vital as most Americans have no clue how addictive the sugary drinks &amp;amp; corn syrup in every food item is slowly killing us all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just a suggestion as we need healthy young Americans to fight China.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Don H. opines: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For years, I've been saying that diets are ridiculous......just eat normal food and lay off the sugars. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Americans have an addiction to processed, industrialized, sugar and chemical laced foods. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That being said, companies involved in the production of these foods spend millions of dollars testing ingredients to be added to certain foods in order to create a likable taste. They test humans by watching how the brain reacts(computer tomography) to certain additives. They are actually creating an addiction to their products........the same principle as the cigarette industry did years ago by increasing the nicotine in cigarettes to create an addiction. So I've been waiting for someone to file a lawsuit against these companies as was done against the cigarette industry. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, it's the fault of the consumer but so was the addicted cigarette smoker. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My grandfather, who was a butcher and smoked Chesterfields all of his life, said 2 things to me in the early 1980s. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He tried a mcdonald's hamburger once and said "what in the hell is this"? He said it doesn't taste like a hamburger at all. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I asked if he was worried about getting cancer for smoking all of his life. He said, "hell no".....he tried another cigarette once and said "I don't know what they're putting in this cigarette but it's not just tobacco. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anyway, highest rates of obesity, autism, diabetes, heart diseases, hyper activity and cancers are in the USA. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don added: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Couple of other things...... &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've lived in France since 1988. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the grocery stores, there is always a huge vegetable and fruit section. Plus, with fresh meats, fish and cheeses in the same section. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A small section of cereals and carbonated drinks. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I live in Russia since 2022. Unfortunately, I was in the hospital for cancer treatment by which I am cancer free at the moment. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anyway, for breakfast in the hospital, I was served either oatmeal, creme of wheat or a corn flavored porridge. Kefir which a type of yogurt. 1 slice of brown bread and 1 white bread. An apple and a tea. Another day, a boiled egg, slice of cheese, slice of ham, a kefir, an apple and a tea. The same bread.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No sweet pastries!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I've rarely seen any obese children in France or Russia. In fact, I've travelled all over Europe and rarely seen any obese kids.....except a few in Italy....pasta!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Bob C. responds: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The article makes some very good points. We all have a choice when it comes to selecting foods, drinks and bad habits. The idea or rewards in insurance costs for good results is appealing. For my money RFK Jr is the first to attempt to tackle the criminal food processing scams and fake data usage in the medical field. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Additives that are bad for our health should not be permitted in our food. Other countries get it so why can't we? The current situation is quite frustrating to consumers trying to be responsible. We would need to memorize all the bad additives and all the cloaked derivative names for the bad additives. Most of us are not chemists and all of us deserve a good faith effort by the regulators, not to mention the food industry.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The medical services certainly know better about the big pharma scams but fail to protect us. There are good supplements that could be used until drastic intervention is required for worst cases. The certificated medical practitioners are the only option covered by insurance. Integrative medicine has much to offer but not being recognized means the alternatives are not regulated for safety. Each time the Dr tells me to "eat properly" I challenge that Dr. to fine properly and offer some supportive nutrition help. Not covered. The chemical solution; which invariable includes side effects that often range into worse than the disease, is the sole solution covered by insurance. The other herbie to overcome is dishonest FED agencies using dishonest data to support bad-for-my-health medicine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Keep up the efforts to expose the sad truth about our available choices and recognize that the consumer fails to make good choices largely by design!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Gary K. tells me: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We are evolutionarily built to store calories.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Putting on weight is easy, taking it off ... is not.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;People can be convinced of even stupid things, like that men can have babies or all cultures are equally valid. So much so that it becomes people's identity (See loons keying Teslas).This means people can be socially programmed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;So show an ideal of "normal healthiness" and create expectations and people will gravitate toward that.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Remember: We all but eliminated snuff and reduced smoking by societal expectations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;So:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) Bring back self-reliance: you are responsible for yourself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) Bring back societal disapproval: people like to be liked and approved of.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3) Caloric information on fast food and coffee products on the purchased package, just like at grocery stores&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— George says: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Regarding your article about RFK Jr.: it's a free country do whatever you want, consume whatever you want, just don't expect other people (tax payers) to pay for your health care.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Brad L. wants to make a couple of points: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I drink my coffee straight, no cream, no sugar.  Like the taste of the coffee itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can't control genetics.  You can control behavior.  Get some tickets, have some accidents, pay higher auto insurance premiums.  No one bats an eye.  Why not let private insurers (get the government out of this) apply the same logic to health insurance?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Charles the Canadian shares his opinion: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hello, I am a Canadian who enjoys reading articles on Outkick.  Realizing I am Canadian, I don't know if you will care about my solution, but here it is:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Power to Act:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The government has the power to eliminate what is harmful to the citizens of its country.  Take red dye No. 3, for example.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of red dye No. 3 in food and ingested drugs due to potential cancer risks observed in lab rats, despite not being a concern in humans. The FDA's action stems from a 2022 petition and the Delaney Clause, which prohibits the use of food additives found to cause cancer in animals or humans.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Why Should the Government Act?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing several types of cancer, including colorectal, post-menopausal breast, uterine, esophageal, kidney, and pancreatic cancers. Experts believe that excess body fat, especially visceral fat, can trigger inflammation, which may contribute to cancer development.  Obesity can lead to increased levels of hormones like insulin and estrogen, which can stimulate cell growth and potentially increase the risk of certain cancers.  Obesity is also linked to other conditions that can increase cancer risk, such as type 2 diabetes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Source of the Problem:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The simple answer is sugar.  Consuming more sugar than the body needs can lead to weight gain because the excess sugar is converted to fat and stored in the body.  Sugary drinks like soda, juice, and sweet tea are often high in fructose, a type of sugar that can increase hunger and make it harder for the body to regulate food intake, contributing to weight gain.  Drinking large amounts of sugary beverages is linked to an increase in visceral fat, a type of deep belly fat that is associated with conditions like diabetes and heart disease.  Numerous studies have shown a positive correlation between sugar intake and weight gain, with some studies finding that people who increased their sugar intake gained weight in a relatively short amount of time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Possible Solution:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The FDA can force regulate the levels or amounts of sugar as a food additive.  This regulation would affect "Big Coffee" for example.  The high levels need to be addressed, as this addiction to sugar is contributing to obesity.  The obesity, in turn, contributes to cancer in humans.  If it can be done with red dye No. 3, it can be done with sugar.  This won't fix how much sugar humans consume on their own accord (teaspoons poured into coffee, chocolate bars consumed, etc.), but it WILL drastically reduce the amount consumed without the knowledge or understanding of humans as they order drinks at a "Big Coffee" producer/retailer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Source of Information and Disclosure:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All information was obtained through a simple Google search online.  I am not a doctor, nor do I have any expertise in weight gain causes or effects of weight gain in humans.  What is troubling is that this information is freely available, and yet the "Big Coffee" industry cares only about sales.  It's about time this stops.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kids and Cellphones in 2025: When is too soon?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a topic that Mrs. Screencaps are about to find us debating in the very near future as Screencaps Jr. heads into junior high. It's also a topic that a bunch of readers are not only discussing, but constantly thinking about. The inbox lit up Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Teacher Geoff advises: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I don't frequently drop everything that I'm doing and fire off an email in response to ScreenCaps, but parenthood topics will frequently get me involved! I've been a high school teacher for 10 years, and my wife has taught upper elementary for 15. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We've got four kids, oldest being a sixth grader. We're right there with you. Our oldest two have watches that let them call/text a handful of people, but don't let them participate in big text chains. My oldest is a boy, and having watched the cancel culture come after young men for ridiculous things that they've tweeted/texted when they were younger, I am very reluctant to put my son (or girls) in a situation where they can say things in an unsupervised situation that can be "circled back to" by others who would choose to do them harm. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Additionally, I have had so many conversations with high schoolers about how they "wish they didn't see so many things on Snapchat" or how "smart phones are so difficult to manage from all the distractions" that are inherent with those devices, that I don't think that the pros of better/more convenient digital communication are worth it. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It'll be a little bit different when little man is driving (we live in a Midwestern state where kids can start driving at 14), but even then, brick phones have value, too! I'm sure you'll get lots of emails on this one, and most of them will be very passionate! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Jeff H. writes:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love the question.  We’ve got a lot of experience here – 7 kids and all, ranging from 22 down to 9.   The short answer is just like you parent each child differently, you make decisions like a cell phone uniquely for each kid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our general rule has been not until you start driving, which for my oldest two was 17.  My 3rd is a social butterfly, so we got him a phone a little earlier, when he turned 16.  My only daughter is 15 and we got her a phone when she turned 15 because 1) we trusted her, 2) she is really into pottery and that means evenings at the pottery studio, so I wanted to be able to track her – made me feel better.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;But the younger boys won’t sniff a phone of their own until at least 16.  Are we too strict?  Maybe.  Will there be wailing and gnashing of teeth? Most definitely.  Do I care?  No.  Once they have a phone you can never go back.  You’re dealing with filters and phone trackers and watching content you can’t possibly screen.  Lot of management for very little actual benefit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bottom line – EVERY other parent I’ve talked with about this has said they wish they would have waited longer to give their kid a phone.  EVERY. SINGLE. ONE.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Another topic that goes hand-in-hand with a phone is social media accounts.  Our standing rule, no exceptions, is not before 18.  We grew up just fine without social media and my kids will too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ron in Lake O, Oregon checks in on this one: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Good morning. Well if he already has the Apple Watch he is doomed so you may as well do the Apple Phone too.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most schools have a no personal electronics during school hours policy now so kids seeing social media crap or texts from their friends doesn't, generally, happen between 0800 and 1600. You can take that statement with a grain of salt. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After and before school the group texts are huge and using an Apple phone magnifies it. Personally I loathe Apple for various reasons and we were LG and are now Google Phone family. Except for our daughter who is a sophomore in HS. She paid for an iPhone with her own money so she could be in her friends' text groups and also HAVE THE RIGHT COLOR TEXT BOX. Yep, peer pressure,  FOMO, and the need to keep up even includes not being a greenie in a bluey world or the other way around. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can monitor everything now though so at least you can see what he is doing. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Chris B. in Johnson City is going through this in his household: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I have a fresh data point for you regarding kids getting phones. We just went through this in our house during the past few weeks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;For background, my wife’s phone developed an "anomaly" a few months ago. This meant that she had to turn her phone to landscape in order to text.  She was growing frustrated with it but mine was fine. We had talked about getting the kids phones now that both are in middle school and stay after school for practices and such. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What really made us pull the trigger was my daughter making the cheer squad. At the first meeting, the girls were told to join an app and text group as the coach didn’t want texts from moms all the time. Being the youngest on the squad, and apparently the only one without a phone, my wife didn’t want to rock the boat. Verizon happened to send my wife an offer and, long story short, we got 4 new iPhone 16s.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes, my daughter (11) and son (13) have 16s. It all happened a little fast, but I’ve been a little surprised. After a few days the novelty started to wear off. I don’t think my son has sent a single text. He got a game and plays it occasionally. He’s more interested in his 3D printer. My daughter texts with a few friends and cousins and has, thus far, kept any boys from getting her number. (Apparently, if you respond to a text from a boy, it means you’re "dating.") It even seems like she is annoyed with checking the app and group text each night.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It should be interesting going forward. My wife set up all the parental controls and I enjoy laughing at the texts between middle school girls after the kids go to bed. Maybe knowing that your parents can go through your phone at any moment put a damper on getting a phone as a young kid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Joe M. says keep the kids out of text groups: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You do not want your kid in one of these text/Snapchat groups.  The bullying kicks into high gear because everyone and their brother has a phone in sixth grade.  However, the kids also use FaceTime to work on group projects, which is ridiculous.  Ex wife bought my 12 year old a phone when he had an Apple watch, in the first week of 6th grade.  The assistant principal had to get involved the three days into school, because a couple of girls kept adding him to text groups that he repeatedly tried to leave, etc.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is also precisely when kids fall into the hole of YouTube and learn interesting things like how much instant money they can make starting a drop shipping business!  Yes, it’s a scam, but YouTube is the gateway.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;F cell phones for kids that aren’t driving.  Nothing good comes from them.  They can’t use them during school hours anyway in our school district.  If it hasn’t happened in your district yet, it’s probably coming.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;— &lt;/i&gt;Billy P. has thoughts here: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hey Joe! Long time reader of Screencaps. Regarding kids and cell phones, I've been really happy with how it has worked out with my oldest (now 17). We started him on a flip phone in 6th grade, he had that all through middle school. Got him a cheap Android ($100) for freshman year and then the cheapest iPhone (SE) sophomore year. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This year he got a job so he's upgraded to the iPhone 15 because he pays for it. Never had a lost or broken phone. Also, no social media. My original plan was to let him get on when he was 16 but he must have grown tired of asking about it. Phones go on the charger an hour before bed and they charge them outside their rooms. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Youngest (13) currently has a flip phone. He says he's embarrassed about it so he constantly forgets to bring it with him to school (which is a plus in my mind). But he can still call his friends, text in group chats, and we can get in touch with him when we need to.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Rob in Tennessee shares how this went in his house: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hey Joe, responding to the question about the correct age for kids to get a cell phone.  My kids weren't allowed to have one until age 13, and there were strict-but-reasonable rules that came with getting one:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1) no social media apps allowed; don't bring that nonsense into my house&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;2) gotta ask before watching youtube videos, as they're not all age-appropriate or productive&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;3) phone does not stay in your room at night (no kid needs that temptation after bedtime - charge it on the kitchen counter or whatever designated central place)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;4) parents can inspect at any time.  (Never had to snoop on my kids, but they follow the rules.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;5) break the rules, and the phone goes away - not a threat, it's a promise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The rules work.  We've never had any issues with online bullying, self-esteem problems, or doing stupid stuff to get "likes" or attention.  It's a win-win system, kids get to be able to communicate with you and not be a tech luddite or pariah amongst their peers, and you get to raise well-adjusted kids that aren't warped by tic-tok trends and unhealthy influences.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screencaps reader finds himself at Augusta National for the second straight year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ricky A. writes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once in a lifetime experience has somehow morphed into two straight years at Augusta. From a friend being gracious with his four-ticket sweep to the Tuesday practice round last year (yes Joe I looked for you &amp;amp; crazy to find out you were no more than a hole away), to somehow having a last late cancellation of another friends family member lands me on the hallowed grounds for the first &amp;amp; second rounds. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Very surreal. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Notable observations: the area is still struggling. Once about 20 miles out driving in the damage around is very evident. Getting into Augusta still plenty of ravaged business buildings unable to reopen. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;As for the course? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I obviously don’t recall each &amp;amp; every tree, nor am I an arborist, but there are numerous trees across the course leaning/massively trimmed/clearly replaced. That said? Course is immaculate &amp;amp; words never do it justice. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Apparently it’s spring break around here. Amazing to see these (high school-ish) aged kids up &amp;amp; at the course at the wee hours putting in working hours &amp;amp; staffing a lot of the retail areas. In addition: I don’t know what some of you all are putting into your bodies to do things to these bathrooms, but have mercy is it unbearable at times. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yet these kids muscle up &amp;amp; keep the facilities running. No way what Bobby Jones had in mind when designing this place. Sheesh. Coolest thing? No clue what it’s called or even if they show it, but sat behind the green on 2, and there’s this black telescoping rod/whip deal that’s used to knock the sand off. Our entire group got more excited for this than any birdies made on the hole. Maybe it’s one of those things you just have to see to appreciate, but just seems like something primed for a TNML member looking for a high end detailing aid. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Been a wild past few days &amp;amp; greatly appreciate the opportunity. Let me end with this, never miss the opportunity if you have the ability to make it to the Master’s. If you don’t? The viewing experience from your home (or gathered with others elsewhere) is better than being at the course.

Thank you Joe &amp;amp; to those in Screencaps community for all you do. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinsey:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was told by a local last year that it was Spring Break. Sounds like that's a yearly tradition, which makes sense for homeowners who rent out their places while they're on vacation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dan is the Masters patron who ran into Masters Anonymous Employee No. 1, who happens to be a Screencaps reader&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dan in Mequon, Wisconsin writes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Because of America's Greatest Daily Column (damn right), two random strangers standing next to each other at the 2024 Par 3 Contest in  Augusta, Georgia discovered that one was a Masters (anonymous) contributor and the other a daily reader.   Over a joke about a player's WAG we started a conversation, a realization of who the Master employee was, and now a friendship.   In honor of that encounter, this year I had to toast my friend from my home in Wisconsin.  But to continue the connection, Thursday, my son who was with me a year ago, attending this year's Masters stopped  by to see Employee #1 pouring beers.  Employee #1, keep the Masters intel and observations coming, and enjoy a beer on the patio at Augusta CC.   The pictures from earlier this week looked great.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joe, on Monday you displayed pictures from last year's Masters trip, and I couldn't help but notice that one was very similar to my picture from 2006.   I didn't black out the ticket but it came from a Member who has subsequently passed, so I think I am safe. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I received the Wednesday newsletter and it was great.  Enjoyed the list of books so keep it coming to our inboxes.  I'll add the Daily Outkick that comes in the late afternoon is a nice summary of that day's columns and news bits.  It gives me an opportunity to circle back on anything I missed.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;################&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is it for this Saturday morning. Helluva post for one that I slapped together at 6 a.m. after having myself a Bulleit old fashioned last night while watching Masters coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it's time to get this day rolling. It's cold. It's sunny. It's not baseball weather. But, we're going to get out there and get these kids running and sucking air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go have a great Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email: joe.kinsey@outkick.com or use my personal Gmail.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Numbers from :&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stuff You Guys Sent In &amp;amp; Stuff I Like : &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-media instagram" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>OutKick</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 11:52:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNTXRqZW5yaTBDRGtWblY0Sk5FYk9GcHFjSGViNzVyajNpYWFVbTB5eEtYNG4tOFIwUUU5ZmtfdlNMeTBBVHI4SXIwRW5lOENPclNNUE01aWRlZGh4Ung0UTVRZEhiRTBFR0tkS2FmQVFWUFk2MVhYM2JPRWwtZ1dmVHFsX0NZY1BxWmc</guid></item><item><title>Doctors re-attach 'decapitated' Illinois woman's HEAD after she suffered horrific fall while exercising - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/illinois/index.html" id="mol-c20ecbb0-16fa-11f0-b2ca-475f2671fcab" class=""&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; woman has revealed how a horrific sports accident left her on the verge of being 'internally decapitated' and made her life miserable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Megan King was just 16 in 2005 when she leapt in the air to catch a soccer ball during gym class and fell to the ground, damaging her right ankle and spine and tearing the muscle off both shoulder blades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The teenager spent more than a year on crutches. Instead of her symptoms subsiding, more appeared. King's joints weakened and her muscles began to tear, and her shoulder blades ached in unbearable pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the years, she underwent 22 surgeries on her shoulders and shoulder blades alone, with doctors mystified as to why her body couldn't heal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took 10 years for King to be diagnosed in 2015 with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13540555/Id-love-push-daughter-swing-without-dislocating-joints-says-mother-suffering-rare-bendy-joints-condition.html"&gt;hypermobile Ehler's-Danlos syndrome (hEDS)&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic disorder that stops collagen — a key joint tissue — from forming properly and leads to joint instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year later, King's neck became dislocated and she was fitted with a Halo brace, a brutal contraption that screws directly into the skull to keep the neck from moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the process to remove the device, her skull nearly became detached from her spine, an almost always deadly condition called&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13388051/I-survived-internally-decapitated-drunk-driver-ploughed-me.html"&gt; internal decapitation or Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;King, now 35, said: 'I flew my chair back to keep gravity from decapitating me. My neurosurgeon had to hold my skull in place with his hands. I couldn't stand. My right side was shaking uncontrollably.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Megan King was just 16 in 2005 when she fell in gym class. Her injuries worsened over the next two decades, which doctors later learned was due to hypermobile Ehler's-Danlos syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;About 10 years after her initial injury, King's skull nearly became detached from her spine, an almost always deadly condition called internal decapitation or Atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;King was rushed into emergency surgery, where doctors spent fused her skull back on to her spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a horror show. I woke up unable to move my head at all,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has now had 37 surgeries and is fused from her skull down to her pelvis, meaning she can no longer shift her head up, down, left or right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spinal fusion involves wo or more vertebrae - bones in the spine - are joined together to keep them from moving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;King said: 'I'm literally a human statue. My spine doesn't move at all. But that doesn't mean I've stopped living.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AOD occurs when the occipital bone at the base of the skull detaches from the atlas, the first or C1, the topmost vertebrae in the spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injury is fatal in over 90 percent of cases, as the damage disrupts nerve signals between the brain and the body, leading to paralysis around vital organs like the lungs and heart, impairing their function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stabilizing the head is crucial to keep it from separating further from the spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AOD is more commonly seen in children and adolescents because the bones are not fully developed yet and may still contain cartilage. They're also more likely to have proportionally larger heads and weaker neck muscles than adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;King, now 35, said: 'I flew my chair back to keep gravity from decapitating me. My neuosurgeon had to hold my skull in place with his hands. I couldn't stand. My right side was shaking uncontrollably'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above iamge shows the fusions in King's neck and spine. She is now fused from her skull to her pelvis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;King is slowly regaining her ability to get back to hobbies she had before that fateful fall 20 years ago, including walking with her dogs and bowling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About eight in 10 AOD cases are due to severe trauma like car crashes, though King's case was likely due to the combination of her fall in high school and her hEDS, the joint weakening condition she also suffers from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AOD itself is rare, accounting for just one percent of all cervical spine injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, King is fused from her skull to her pelvis and can't bend, twist or slouch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she is slowly regaining her ability to get back to hobbies she had before that fateful fall 20 years ago. This includes a recent bowling outing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I didn’t plan on playing. I was just there to watch friends. But something in me said, "Why not try?"' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I bowled a strike—on my very first try. My friends screamed and clapped and cheered like wild. They weren’t just celebrating the strike. They were celebrating everything I’ve survived.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That one strike turned into three that night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;King said: 'I’m still learning what my new body can do.It’s not easy, but I’m adapting. And I’m always surprised by what I can still accomplish.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 11:43:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr’s long, complicated history with the measles vaccines - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNWVhadHdnemM4VDloa2pNLU9ZS0RPY0I0a2E3S054RDNvNEQ4d3M0VmtFbUM0ZF9FMkRyWWMtYnZGcC1EMmh5NVZCQmp4NnZ6RUtHZm1nYjZRaERzU084VWZCOUx2Um5IODJ6eUJRUk12Rjl5SmRIeXphdUw1NzcybTVFWV9GTzZaRDlUVWpfMUUtdmFEbnBBSWd6ZjBvWjZDWEZHVUxFb084dkloSFHSAaQBQVVfeXFMTnkxR2pISjVyc2FqM0lPYnpvakJyekJrLTVxa1E0YUFTUTl3aEZob1VvdFBUOTFDZy12MXpIeG5KcEUtaWZWdE9qSkxiSDNIUVRiVnJqTERCTTRuT2p6ald5Qnlyc1Z3MmxQWDl2NHIzR1VZUUh0bFR0Z200a0NBOHFMVXE2eGVQenJ5WU9zcmUxTUotaFVveDQ5dElIYTZlWHZ4RmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week made his strongest endorsement yet of the measles vaccine amid an ongoing outbreak that has killed three and infected more than 600 people across the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qh00023b6om03vv4h2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But his &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html"&gt;recent push&lt;/a&gt; for people to get vaccinated for measles stands in stark contrast to Kennedy’s years of work against measles vaccines, including suing the state of New York for its vaccine mandates, and making numerous claims that the shot is dangerous and unnecessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00033b6otdssjch7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;comments on X&lt;/a&gt; last Sunday that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, “is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” set off vaccine critics who saw the statement as a betrayal of the health secretary’s longtime views on vaccine safety.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00043b6ov1zbi0cu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Bobby Kennedy was our founder, but Bobby Kennedy is now the Secretary of HHS,” Mary Holland, CEO of the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense, said in a video statement. “He certainly left off that in my personal experience, and in the personal experience of many people at CHD, the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine was extremely injurious.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00053b6oenstuw38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Holland went on to repeat disproven claims that the MMR vaccine causes autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00063b6o2lgu5iiw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The health secretary followed up this Thursday with a Fox News interview, where he told host Martha MacCallum that it is “very hard to tell” whether measles deaths this year could have been averted with vaccinations. “We need to do better at treating kids who have this disease, and not just saying the only answer is vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00073b6onnjx5zvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also discussed the health agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/health/kennedy-autism-causes/index.html"&gt;“massive research and testing” plan&lt;/a&gt; to find the causes of autism by this September, a project he said will probe vaccinations along with environmental exposures, food and societal factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00083b6ovd7ren4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Kennedy has been most critical of Covid-19 vaccines in recent years, MMR immunizations have been one of his earliest and most consistent targets for misinformation and alarm&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;over the last two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi00093b6olujpgkws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN reached out to HHS for comment regarding Kennedy’s past and recent remarks on MMR vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000a3b6ow0d05k65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As Kennedy wrote in his 2023 book with Brian Hooker, Vax-Unvax, “The MMR vaccine is the tip of the spear regarding the modern debate around vaccine safety.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000b3b6o6sl8h55q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are three ways Kennedy questioned the vaccine’s safety and the severity of measles infections themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000d3b6oaygtqxye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The theory that MMR vaccines led to autism first took hold with a since-retracted 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield. As the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/24/autism.vaccine.doctor.banned/index.html"&gt;disbarred British physician&lt;/a&gt; rose to prominence in the anti-vaccine world, so did Kennedy — who repeatedly defended his debunked research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000e3b6osuqtuggd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Wakefield [and his co-researchers] did not state that MMR causes autism,” Kennedy and Hooker wrote in their 2023 book. “They merely pointed out the timing of the vaccine before the onset of symptoms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000f3b6ospe7d9o7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ten of the 12 co-authors on the study &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)15715-2/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;issued a retraction&lt;/a&gt; in 2004, saying it established no causal link between the MMR shot and autism. Infants with autism typically start showing signs between 12-24 months of age; the first dose of the MMR vaccine is usually given when a child is 12 months old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000g3b6of0agqx8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, like Wakefield, has asserted over the years that MMR vaccines lead to myriad adverse events besides autism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000h3b6ofbapf1kn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            MMR vaccines have an “unconscionably high injury rate” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-s-response-to-the-message-of-measles-what-the-new-yorker-wouldnt-publish/" target="_blank"&gt;wrote on CHD’s website&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, citing gastrointestinal and respiratory complications from a mid-1970s study. Those are symptoms “that might persuade rational consumers to choose the infections over the vaccine,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000i3b6ojn60p8fz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This March, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank"&gt;speaking to Fox News’ Sean Hannity&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy repeated the claim that the vaccines themselves are as risky at the virus. “[The MMR vaccine] causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes,” and leads to “deaths every year,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000j3b6ouswa0bu3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are no reported deaths from the vaccine among healthy people, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;Infectious Disease Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kennedy has repeatedly said that measles outbreaks are not unusual, infection is not severe in healthy people, and deaths with measles are due to other causes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000m3b6oqsjfvqvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you look at the kids in Africa who die from measles, or these other infectious diseases, they’re all malnourished,” he said on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6LJXPOv4SM" target="_blank"&gt;Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; in June 2023. “It’s hard for a disease to kill a healthy person; it’s hard for an infectious disease to kill a healthy person with a rugged immune system.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            State health departments reported &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;no underlying health conditions&lt;/a&gt; reported in the three US deaths this year, the first measles deaths in the country in a decade. All three, two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico, were unvaccinated. In the Fox interview Thursday, Kennedy suggested at least one of the children had prior medical complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000o3b6ogfcz2qxs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also this year dismissed the notion that many died from measles in a 2019 Samoan outbreak that killed 83 and infected more than 5,000 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000p3b6oldodpf5l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Details of Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/politics/video/rfk-jr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-samoa-digvid"&gt;visit to Samoa&lt;/a&gt; months before the 2019 outbreak resurfaced during his Senate confirmation hearings. He went to the country &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/lsamoa-medical-freedom-hero-court-case-dismissed/" target="_blank"&gt;following an invitation&lt;/a&gt; from an anti-vaccine advocate, but denies he campaigned against vaccination while he was there. He also denied to senators that dozens of people died from the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000q3b6o0d2i3lmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the people did not have measles,” when tissue samples were tested, he told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) “We don’t know what was killing them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000r3b6o07t9q5ea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That claim is a “total fabrication,” Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-kennedy-vaccines-pacific-42a9cb583c71f165699b16710884c474" target="_blank"&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/a&gt;. Ekeroma also said Kennedy met with anti-vaccine advocates while there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000t3b6o7zydky14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, along with former federal prosecutor Michael Sussman, sued the state of New York in 2019 to oppose vaccine requirement for school-age children. The state’s legislature passed the law, which removed religious exemptions, amid a measles outbreak that year among Brooklyn’s Orthodox Jewish community that infected nearly 800 people.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000u3b6o9nuzf1os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A state Supreme Court justice rejected the suit days later. The Kennedy-chaired Children’s Health Defense vowed to keep fighting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000v3b6oe086z78i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That same year, Kennedy rallied with Washington state residents against a MMR vaccine mandate for children attending school. At the time, there were roughly 50 reported measles cases in the state. It spread to 71 people, most of them unvaccinated children, during the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6819a5.htm" target="_blank"&gt;monthslong outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As health secretary, Kennedy has maintained that position that vaccination should be a choice despite the spread of measles across 23 states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d8m1qi000x3b6omwegd64z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The federal government’s position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/measles-outbreak-urban-areas/index.html"&gt;told CBS News&lt;/a&gt; April 8. “I always said during my campaign — and every part, every public statement I’ve made — I’m not gonna take people’s vaccines away from them. What I’m gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

This time, there was no talk of the vaccine that prevents measles deaths - unlike many of his long days since the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The focus was on their healing," Mr Holbrooks said. "You never want to see anybody pass away, especially a child that young, from any kind of illness, because there is a prevention for it - the MMR vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like other Seminole natives, Mr Holbrooks was not vaccinated against measles as a child. He got a shot in college, and another in February, when his hometown became the epicentre of one of the country's worst measles outbreaks in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The US has seen more than 700 cases this year. The majority of infections - 541 as of Friday - occurred in western Texas, with 56 patients sent to the hospital. Cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas also are linked to the outbreak. Two children, including Daisy, have died - the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;first recorded fatalities from measles in the US since 2015.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It's not slowing down either, public health experts say. They try to reach vaccine-hesitant residents, but struggle with those who carry on with daily life as usual and with mixed messaging from federal officials, including Kennedy who has endorsed immunization conspiracy theories in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I wish there were more coming in to get the vaccine," Mr Holbrooks said. "We can put messaging out, but it's up to them to come see us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The South Plains public health director, Zach Holbrooks, is trying to reach vaccine-hesitant communities through messaging and public advertisements&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Going about' life in a measles epicentre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The western Texas town of Seminole - population 7,000 - is bordered by miles of rural farmland and oil fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Among billboards for restaurants, gun silencers and tractors, a digital sign hints at the crisis gripping the community: a warning about the dangers of measles, which can cause complications including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It has spread rapidly among Mennonites, a religious community living near Seminole. Mr Holbrooks estimates the population could be as many as 40,000 across several counties. In those areas, public school vaccination rates are as low as 82%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Roughly 95% of a community must be vaccinated against the measles to achieve herd immunity, when enough of a group is immune to a disease that its spread is limited and the unvaccinated are protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Holbrooks remembers when the Low German Mennonite group began immigrating to his hometown and nearby states in the 1970s. The religion has no specific doctrines against vaccinations, but they tend to avoid many modern aspects of life, including the health care system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Their community is not alone. At least 118,000 kindergartners in Texas are exempt from one or more vaccines, mostly in rural areas, said Terri Burke, director of Texas vaccine advocacy group, the Immunization Partnership. Parents can get a waiver to exempt their child from school vaccine requirements for a variety of reasons, including religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Savannah Knelsen, an 18-year-old server at a Seminole barbecue restaurant, has not been vaccinated against measles - or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Like many in Seminole, Jessica Giesbrecht (left) and Savannah Knelsen (right) have opposing views on vaccination &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many of her family members and friends - also unvaccinated - caught the measles in recent weeks. One relative developed a fever of 104.5 F (40.2 C), but still chose not to go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The recent deaths of two children have not convinced her to get vaccinated, she said, adding that she was healthy and wanted to let her body "fight off" infections. Experts agree the vaccine is the best way to prevent infections - including severe ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Knelsen's 19-year-old co-worker, Jessica Giesbrecht, along with her family, has been vaccinated against the measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm worried for my baby niece," Ms Giesbrecht said, adding she was too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, the two said the outbreak doesn't weigh heavily on daily life. Others in Seminole agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A cashier at a local pharmacy said no one has stopped by for measles vaccinations since the outbreak started. "People are just going about their lives," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Texas has had over 500 cases of measles, most concentrated in rural western counties &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Kennedy tries to 'cover middle ground'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Sunday, Kennedy made his first trip to the region since the outbreak to attend the 8-year-old girl's funeral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The top US health official is an unlikely figure to spearhead the fight against measles - he has in the past endorsed conspiracy theories about immunizations, including debunked claims about links to autism. He downplayed the outbreak in western Texas at first, calling it "not unusual".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Trump echoed these remarks last weekend, saying that only a "fairly small number of people" had been impacted, when he was asked by the BBC about the outbreak aboard Air Force One. It was "not something new", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On Wednesday, Kennedy gave his strongest statement yet in support of the measles vaccine, telling the BBC's US partner CBS News, "The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The remarks were met with social media backlash from some anti-vaccine supporters. Kennedy added, however, that the government "should not be mandating" vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The influence of some of his earlier remarks lingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In one of several Mennonite-owned natural-health stores in Seminole, dozens of bottles of cod liver oil - a supplement that contains vitamin A - are on display. Alongside the vaccine, Kennedy has promoted vitamin A as an alternative measles treatment, a remedy doctors say should not be given without guidance from a physician and is no substitute for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Vitamin A is sometimes used to help treat measles - but should not be given without a physician's guidance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The treatment has at times proven dangerous. Covenant Children's Hospital in nearby Lubbock told the BBC it has treated several unvaccinated children with measles for vitamin A toxicity - some had used it a preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The community needs federal officials to provide stronger messaging to help convince people to get vaccinated and slow the outbreak, said Gordon Mattimoe, director of the health department in nearby Andrews County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People look to their leaders to lead," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Jeff Hutt, a former spokesperson for the Make America Healthy Again political action committee and Kennedy's former national field director, argued that the health secretary had to "cover the middle ground", providing statements that are "politically adequate" while also providing sceptical stances on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In covering the middle ground, I'm not necessarily sure he was able to reassure folks that he had a handle on [measles], or that he was able to reassure folks that he was sticking to his guns," Mr Hutt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Slashing funds in an outbreak zone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Trump administration's health policies could have other consequences in Texas, officials say. Local health departments are at risk of losing critical resources because of attempts to cut $11.4b (£8.8) in public health grants. The move was temporarily blocked by a judge last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Mattimoe said that because of the potential cuts - around $250,000 in grant funding for his health department - he is not able to hire a new nurse to give immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In a statement to the BBC, the US Department of Health and Human Services said it deployed the "necessary" resources from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The CDC is in close, constant communication with local and state health officials on the ground to ensure they have what they need," the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Texas Department of Health Services could lose as much as $550m in grant funding. It has provided staff, vaccines, testing and other support to local health departments, but likely will need extra funding, said spokesperson Chris Van Deusen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Mattimoe contacted lawmakers and the state for help, but is not hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I don't think they have the funds," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Trusted messengers'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Local officials have seen some success in measles vaccination clinics, but hope even more will get vaccinated&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In nearby Lubbock, Texas, just two days after the news of Daisy's death, all was quiet at the health department's vaccination clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other days have been busier, with as many as 20 people coming in for vaccines, said Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city, where hospitals receive children with severe measles cases from more rural counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Since the outbreak began in January, the city of Seminole has vaccinated 103 adults and 143 children against the measles, Mr Holbrooks said. The neighbouring three rural counties decided to close their underused vaccine clinics and send more staff to hard-hit Seminole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's always talk on, what else can we do, and are we doing enough?" Mr Holbrooks said. "We want to build trust, not tear it down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At times, local health officials have seen progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A Mennonite doctor in Andrews County gained community members' trust and encouraged them to get vaccinated, said Mr Mattimoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Those trusted messengers in those communities - I think that's very important," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Wells hopes vaccinations will start to pick up after the latest measles death and the city's new guidance to vaccinate children as young as six months, instead of one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The bigger city saw an outbreak at a daycare among children too young to be fully vaccinated, a situation she believes will be helped by the earlier shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But, "there's always going to be some people that we don't reach", Ms Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;That means the virus is likely to circulate for a while in western Texas regions where people are unvaccinated, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We're just at the beginning of it," Mr Mattimoe said. "It's going to have to run through the community. Until they get that natural immunity, it'll just keep running its course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 09:14:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9FSnhfaGh4MjJoRzdlRi1KZWZPNWJMeFFiSWdVNU1wRDE5cnUwRk9NbnVSRkRUa25yU1B6c0dGTnZOUHBhbHBWc2haMlVOSUg3RjN4ZjFYWFp3d9IBX0FVX3lxTE9vbnV1TWpVVEFNczJGd29lNTJ6cVBPVlVaUGFQUzM2WXFuT2RwblFFeHVRdko1amRxM1JMZkIwbGhzVmZGNzNhWlN6RDNSR3Y0VGRhWWZFVVFxSDB5eURj</guid></item><item><title>How climate change is supercharging pollen allergies - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOTVNlbGtHQjZqYnVkaFNNY1dvMkNrWDhWQXRZNXRRWEVuTmRKbUNoWEZTOVFuY0MwaGZQRVJDZlAzMEgtM3E2dU1BUVJkUUhWdmJRY3dMaHdRZE1HUjBKQjB0LUFRUDZoQ1l0cDdGc0pKSFpfZG9vYWdPTXZ6S3k2d1RzZWFJMGtJd0dBektMaUs5Q0g5NkpFbFpYbmZmWElNM3VRTG4wc2U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;How climate change is supercharging pollen allergies&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 EXUng"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3nc06.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Pollen floats in the air around the dangling catkins of a birch tree (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;b id="seasonal-allergy-sufferers-are-being-hit-with-more-pollen-over-a-longer-season-due-to-rising-temperatures,-but-global-warming-is-also-triggering-alarming-extreme-allergy-events,-say-experts." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Seasonal allergy sufferers are being hit with more pollen over a longer season due to rising temperatures, but global warming is also triggering alarming extreme allergy events, say experts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;People could see the thunderstorm, but they couldn't see what was going on inside it.

As temperatures rise, many regions – especially the US, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/all.13758" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and Australia – are seeing seasonal allergies affect an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP173" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;increasing proportion of people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12755" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;over a longer season&lt;/a&gt; and with worse symptoms, say scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Pollen itself is an essential and ever-present part of our world. These microscopic particles pass between plants, enabling them to reproduce. While some plants spread their pollen with the help of insects, others rely on the wind, sending huge volumes of this powdery substance airborne. Many trees, grasses and weed species rely upon wind dispersal for their pollen. It is these that are especially likely to cause seasonal allergies, or hay fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This occurs when your immune system mistakenly identifies the pollen as a harmful substance, triggering a response normally reserved for pathogenic bacteria or viruses. Common symptoms can include a runny nose, itchy eyes and sneezing. In some cases, seasonal allergies can trigger breathing difficulties when inflammation in the airways leads to swelling, making it hard to get enough air into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed responded. There was some evidence they were producing a more allergenic form of pollen – Lewis Ziska&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While it isn't possible to determine exactly how much climate change influenced the 2016 thunderstorm asthma incident in Melbourne, Beggs is "reasonably certain" it had some impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eLrdPC"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-e11d1f0-0 eVThlc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-1 kDQByp"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-e11d1f0-3 fBWdkT"&gt;How thunderstorms supercharge pollen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-2 ewSByo"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-4 gxuhBx"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Exactly how thunderstorms trigger or exacerbate asthma in this way is still not fully understood. The leading theory is that cold air downdrafts that occur during thunderstorm weather systems generate strong cross winds that blow at ground level, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2022/03/18/thunderstorm-asthma-and-public-health-looking-back-to-move-forward/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;whipping up pollen grains and fungal spores from grass and plants&lt;/a&gt;. These then get carried high into the storm system by updrafts, where moisture in the clouds causes them to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cea.12709" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;swell and break apart into smaller fragments&lt;/a&gt;, massively increasing the number of allergen particles in the air. The strong electric field that develops during thunderstorms may also enhance the rupture of the pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Thankfully, major thunderstorm asthma events remain rare. But climate change is increasing people's risk of pollen exposure in other ways, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For one thing, rising temperatures mean that pollen seasons – when plants emit pollen, typically during spring and summer – are starting earlier and lasting longer, says Elaine Fuertes, a public health scientist who focuses on the environment and allergic disease at the National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, UK. "You're going to get people who experience symptoms earlier in the year, for a longer period of time," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In parts of the world, including the US and Europe, one of the key culprits is ragweed – a widespread group of flowering plants that many people consider to be weeds. There are various species of ragweed around the world but they can produce mind-bending amounts of pollen. A single plant is capable of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/allergies/pollen-allergy/ragweed-allergy/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;emitting one billion pollen grains&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Ragweed grows in gardens and farmland but also in nooks and crannies in urban environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Allergies to ragweed pollen already &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/pollen-allergy/ragweed-pollen/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;affect some 50 million people in the US alone&lt;/a&gt;. A study analysing data from 11 locations in North America between 1995 to 2015 found that 10 of those locations experienced longer ragweed pollen seasons – sometimes much longer. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ragweed-pollen-season" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;During that 20-year period&lt;/a&gt;, the season lengthened by 25 days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, 21 days in Fargo, North Dakota and 18 days in Minneapolis, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The winter warms, the springs are starting earlier, and the falls are being delayed, and so the time that you spend outdoors in contact with allergic pollen is definitely going up," says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University, in New York, US, and one of the scientists who researched the ragweed pollen season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;These changes get more drastic in northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia, Ziska says.

In the 2000s, the pollen season in the continental US started three days earlier than it did during the 1990s, but crucially, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/gcb.12755" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the amount of pollen in the air was also 46% higher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is partly because carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere are rising, due to emissions from human activities. And many of the most bothersome plants for hay fever sufferers thrive on CO2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111712" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;grew a certain type of grass&lt;/a&gt; under different CO2 levels, for example, they found that plants grown in an atmosphere containing CO2 at 800 parts per million (ppm) had flowers that produced about 50% more pollen than plants grown in air containing 400ppm. The latter mimics current levels of CO2 in Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ziska, who authored the 2022 book &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cup.columbia.edu/book/greenhouse-planet/9780231206709" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Greenhouse Planet&lt;/a&gt;, ran similar experiments with ragweed. His results mirror those of other researchers. "Every time we cranked up the carbon dioxide, the ragweed plants responded. They grew more. They produced more pollen," he says. "And there was some evidence that they were producing a more allergenic form of the pollen, one that could induce your immune system to respond even to a greater extent than had been in the past."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The spread of invasive species across new parts of the world is also triggering allergic reactions in new populations of people. While originally from North America, ragweed, for example, has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.12156" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;spread across Europe&lt;/a&gt;, as well as into Australia, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71318-0_8" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and South America. Already, some 60% of people in Hungary, 20% in Denmark and 15% in the Netherlands &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/30447-ragweed-allergy-on-the-rise-in-europe" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;are reportedly sensitive to the pollen&lt;/a&gt; from this prolific group of plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3nd94.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images With the amount of pollen in the air increasing due to climate change, scientists predict that seasonal allergies will also worsen (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;With the amount of pollen in the air increasing due to climate change, scientists predict that seasonal allergies will also worsen (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;About one-third of the increase is due to the continuing spread of the invasive species, the researchers note. The remaining two-thirds is specifically due to climate change, including the lengthening of the growing season as temperatures warm. "So it'll be an earlier season, a longer season, as well as a more intense season for those who experience allergic symptoms – and then a higher risk of new sensitisation for a previously unexposed population," Fuertes says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Not every region in the world will see more pollen production. Some researchers have found that southern California, for example, will experience earlier &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/11/1461/2014/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;but less productive pollen seasons&lt;/a&gt;, largely as a result of reduced rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Relatively speaking, the amount of pollen in the air will still vary from year to year, Fuertes points out. But that may not be of much help to hay fever sufferers. "Once you're sensitised and go on to develop allergic symptoms, you'll still likely experience symptoms during years when pollen levels may be lower than average," she says. "You'll react to the pollen that's around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So, what can people do about this? Cutting carbon emissions would help to avert some of the worst climate impacts and other strategies might also mitigate the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It might be possible to make some drastic but direct interventions, for example. A century ago, some US cities even set up commissions to tackle ragweed. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1932/08/12/archives/chicago-employs-1350-in-hay-fever-fight-jobless-used-to-cut-down.html" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;"Chicago employs 1,350 in hay fever fight,"&lt;/a&gt; blares one headline from 1932. The news story explains that men – otherwise unemployed during the Great Depression – were paid the equivalent of one week's food and lodging (and "25 cents in cash") for each day they spent cutting down the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l3ncf9.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Planting of tree species that produce less allergy-inducing airborne pollen is one way cities can help sufferers (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Planting of tree species that produce less allergy-inducing airborne pollen is one way cities can help sufferers (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other solutions lie in smarter urban design. "We should definitely green our cities," Fuertes says. "But we do need to do it thoughtfully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is also important to monitor and forecast pollen levels, scientists say. "We need to know what we're breathing in. That's a pretty fundamental thing in terms of our health," says Beggs, who points out that while most people take it for granted that they can get reliable, real-time, validated information on metrics like temperature or rainfall in their area, relatively few can say the same for airborne allergens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But even those services that are modelling pollen counts in an extensive, detailed way – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03686-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;such as the Finnish Meteorological Institute&lt;/a&gt; – aren't monitoring or modelling airborne allergen levels, which are more accurate as each pollen grain can release different amounts of allergens and they can vary by the weather conditions. These are a different measurement, Fuertes points out, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(23)01469-0/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;one that she's shown is more closely linked to allergy symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. "Nobody is measuring allergen levels on a routine basis," Fuertes says. "We should be moving towards that."   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall, experts say, the science is clear. Without concrete, coordinated action, climate change will continue to make hay fever worse across many regions of the world. This might include more dramatic, deadly events like thunderstorm asthma. But it might also mean more people sniffling and suffering, for a longer season, every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We have the studies now to show that it's really having an impact on human health," says Beggs.

              &lt;p&gt;At 42, Dr. Darshan Shah was used to being stressed. As a successful surgeon based in Los Angeles, he had spent 20 years regularly working 12-hour days, starting at 6 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when his wife got pregnant with their first child in 2016, he realized he needed to make a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lifestyle-changes-live-longer-healthy-habits-genes-study-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;change to be healthier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I found myself in a state of poor health. I had developed an autoimmune disease, I was 50 pounds overweight, I had high blood pressure that could not be controlled with medication, I had high cholesterol, and lots of risk factors for an early death," Shah, 52, told Business Insider. "But my son had a long life ahead of him, and I wanted to be around for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah took a year off from being a surgeon and began researching the science behind &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/8-simple-habits-add-decades-onto-to-your-life-research-2023-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;long-term health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"I was able to completely turn my health around and completely come off 10 different prescription medications within a year. I lost 50 pounds, and my autoimmune disease completely disappeared," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His focus improved at work, too, and he found that he was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-self-care-tips-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;no longer tired&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, he "wanted to wake up every morning and jump out of bed to attack the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah's transformation made him realize this was the type of medicine he wanted to practice — helping people &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/healthy-habits-fit-throughout-life-personal-trainer-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;get and stay healthy&lt;/a&gt; rather than just addressing medical issues as they arise. In 2016, he founded Next Health, a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-clinic-owner-reversed-biological-age-daily-routine-2024-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;health optimization&lt;/a&gt; and longevity clinic with locations across the US and in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Shah does experimental longevity treatments at his clinics, but he still thinks that getting the basics right, as he did, is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/things-longevity-scientist-centenarians-does-for-live-longer-2025-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;key for a long, healthy life&lt;/a&gt;.

A 2022 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004109" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; conducted on over 10,000 British civil service workers found that participants who reported getting less than five hours of sleep a night at the age of 50 had a higher risk of developing chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, and dying from long-term health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sleep-more-cut-calories-without-dieting-study-suggests-2022-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; is also associated with eating fewer calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Shah sleeps for seven hours a night and says he feels amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

He goes to the gym every other day to do a routine that is 70% strength training using free weights, and 30% cardio, for which he runs on a treadmill — plus some stretching to warm up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah also tries to get up and move every 45 minutes when he's at work to break up periods of sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They say that sitting is the new smoking, and I think that's true," Shah said. "As a surgeon, you spend a lot of time either standing or sitting in one position, and that sedentary non-movement leads to a high risk of disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research shows that sitting for longer than 10 hours a day is associated with a higher risk of dying early, a 2023 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/22/1457" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of about 12,000 people over the age of 50, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, suggests a solution. It found that 22 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise a day — such as doing housework, brisk walking, or cycling — appeared to offset the negative &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-exercise-prevent-death-sitting-all-day-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;effects of being sedentary all day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

According to Cleveland Clinic, eating a healthy diet, exercising, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding excessive alcohol and drug use can help to keep testosterone levels normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As BI previously reported, once considered taboo, growing numbers of men are doing &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-men-testosterone-therapy-masculine-ideal-2024-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;testosterone replacement therapy&lt;/a&gt; without an official diagnosis of "low testosterone," to help them build muscle, get erections, and have more energy. However, it's unclear whether it is beneficial for young, healthy men, and side effects can include acne, hair loss, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Human biology is very much like that of other mammals, and yet so very different in areas where it matters. One of these being human neurology, with aspects like the human brain and the somatosensory pathways (i.e. touch etc.) being not only hard to study in non-human animal analogs, but also (genetically) different enough that a human test subject is required. Over the past years the use of human organoids have come into use, which are (parts of) organs grown from human pluripotent stem cells and thus allow for ethical human experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For studying aspects like the somatosensory pathways, multiple of such organoids must be combined, with recently [Ji-il Kim] et al. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08808-3" target="_blank"&gt;as published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; demonstrating the creation of a so-called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembloid" target="_blank"&gt;assembloid&lt;/a&gt;. This four-part assembloid contains somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids, covering the entirety of such a pathway from e.g. one’s skin to the brain’s cortex where the sensory information is received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such assembloids are – much like organoids – extremely useful for not only studying biological and biochemical processes, but also to research diseases and disorders, including tactile deficits as previously studied in mouse models by e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)30584-0?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867416305840%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;[Lauren L. Orefice] et al.&lt;/a&gt; caused by certain genetic mutations in &lt;em&gt;Mecp2 &lt;/em&gt;and other genes, as well as genes like &lt;em&gt;SCN9A&lt;/em&gt; that can cause clinical absence of pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using these assembloids the development of these pathways can be studied in great detail and therapies developed and tested.&lt;/p&gt;
	            &lt;/div&gt;

Another part comes from their nutrient-packed profile, which seems to support a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eight-healthy-lifestyle-habits-could-extend-your-life-by-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their popularity has led researchers to look deeper into what happens when these fruits are made a daily habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investigating different dietary approaches, a notable study gained attention for its focus on the potential of one avocado per day to enhance overall diet quality and encourage healthier eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-avocados-the-study"&gt;Eating avocados – the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor Kristina Petersen and retired Professor Penny Kris-Etherton from Penn State University’s &lt;a href="https://hhd.psu.edu/nutrition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Department of Nutritional Sciences&lt;/a&gt; led an effort that put a spotlight on how a single daily avocado could affect everyday food choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work provides a window into how simple additions to meals might improve nutritional habits without major overhauls to what people eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their publication in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; examined how a straightforward intervention could lead to better adherence to dietary guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes at a time when many are looking for ways to improve their health through small but meaningful changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-following-the-guidelines"&gt;Following the guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,008 adults participated in the investigation. Researchers gathered details about what everyone ate through telephone interviews that involved 24-hour dietary intake data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tracked how closely each individual stuck to the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; by using the Healthy Eating Index as a yardstick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were split into two groups over 26 weeks. One group continued with their existing patterns but limited avocados, while the other added one avocado daily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since only about 2% of American adults &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-fruit-can-protect-you-from-late-life-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;eat this fruit regularly&lt;/a&gt;, the project offered new information on how avocados might fit into many different diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-they-learned-about-eating-avocados"&gt;What they learned about eating avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who enjoyed a daily avocado experienced a meaningful shift in their diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Avocados are a powerhouse of nutrition, and our objective was to ascertain if their regular consumption could boost diet quality,” explained Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators noticed that this single change had an influence on how individuals approached meals, with greater emphasis on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-foods-with-these-key-nutrients-will-dramatically-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrient-rich items&lt;/a&gt; overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This improvement suggests that simple strategies like daily avocado consumption can significantly enhance diet quality,” said Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also uncovered one more result that caught their attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The substitution effect we observed is particularly noteworthy, as it demonstrates avocados’ potential in replacing higher-calorie, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breaking-free-from-ultra-processed-foods-the-surprising-health-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;less nutritious foods&lt;/a&gt;,” Petersen added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By fostering better compliance with dietary guidelines, we can substantially lower the risk of chronic conditions and improve overall health outcomes,” said Petersen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings point to avocados as a practical avenue for people interested in following established nutrition recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By emphasizing basic, tasty items, this fruit may spark positive steps toward heart health, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/type-2-diabetes-heightens-alzheimers-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; management, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados contain fiber and beneficial fats, which contribute to a satisfying feeling after a meal. That quality might support strategies that keep a person on track when planning or cooking dinner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time they are used in place of sodium-heavy or refined-grain foods, the odds of maintaining a balanced diet appear to increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-avocados-a-short-history"&gt;Eating avocados – a short history&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados, known by the scientific name &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Persea americana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, have a long history traced to Mexico and Central America. Indigenous peoples domesticated this fruit well over 10,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, they introduced avocados to Europe, setting the stage for their eventual spread around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name “avocado” comes from the Nahuatl word “ahuacatl.” The shape of the fruit may have inspired that original term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the origin, the popularity of this versatile item continues to climb, with new dishes popping up in cafes and restaurants everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nutritional-details"&gt;Nutritional details&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados are recognized for their monounsaturated fats, which may help reduce bad cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can be good news for heart health, especially when combined with a balanced approach to other foods. They also contain an impressive amount of potassium, which supports &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/relaxation-techniques-can-lower-high-blood-pressure-at-least-temporarily/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure regulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people notice how avocados fit into a weight-management plan. They are known to help individuals feel satisfied, so there is less temptation to grab a snack soon after a meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of fiber helps maintain a steady flow through the digestive system, possibly providing an extra advantage for everyday wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sustainability-considerations"&gt;Sustainability considerations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some regions face pressure to keep up with the rising demand for this fruit. Farms require a fair amount of water, and shipping them long distances can raise concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/biotic-homogenization-human-impacts-diminish-biodiversity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ecological footprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making choices that align with sustainable sources is one way to reduce any negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers have started exploring new farming methods to preserve soil and use resources more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness of these efforts can be beneficial for those who want to enjoy avocados while showing respect for the environment at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-ve-learned-about-eating-avocados"&gt;What we’ve learned about eating avocados&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Penn State findings shine a spotlight on how a modest change might be enough to elevate meal quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though these results are encouraging, continued exploration may uncover additional food-based strategies that fit different lifestyles or dietary needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small steps hold promise for those seeking to improve their daily habits. A simple addition in the kitchen can open the door to better eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados have stood out as a delicious candidate that suits many palates, which makes it easier to stick with a plan over the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2475299124000052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:06:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPRXJqWXZ3N3VnUzgwODdGdEJUTld1SWNxSUNzQ09ScldVeXp3MkZkSHpaV3lzb0NXWC1PYzlkMHhzTUFpYUVEYnphNThsNzdkTXJEYmp3RFJRMFVKVU5NcTV5ZGFncHY2YktmV2FlRk5DanNLOXpWUkltbE02UjVVUWVUSTM5b3lpaTFXVW0xcHVUcEwwaVc1bldVaklKeXpNdDVRUA</guid></item><item><title>As a lifelong insomniac, can magnesium really help me sleep? - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaDFnZFFNWFJvT0VKUTJsUlhKN1hyaVBEQkZqNWpjWkdxbTBhUm9iUDNsVWlKMjN0TlVCeXdZY1E3Y1BCLWJQdDljSDhleUViR1hUV0Q4TW9LcGxJMGxiYnZNNllrQVBHX2VLSE42a2FZRm51ekVnaE4yODFHWWxXOENhY21TODVtbWxZQnVwYTZIRkJ6MDc5Vi1oWFh3U1RGX29id3QwX1N2NHhMVFFIQkJMcmUwSEdINWhqMQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As a lifelong insomniac, usually found staring at the ceiling at 3am at least three times a week, who has tried everything from prescription sleeping pills to herbal tea via hypnosis to nod off, magnesium was one of the few remedies I hadn’t explored, both because I wasn’t convinced by the evidence and because I am a&lt;span&gt; supplement sceptic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My diet was already healthy, I reasoned, so why contribute to an unregulated supplement industry worth an estimated £138 billion worldwide? But desperate after a fretful night in February, I spent £12.95 on a two-month supply of magnesium citrate from a health food company on Amazon. Fast-forward seven weeks and, barring four occasions when I last recall looking at the clock at 1am, I have slept for six uninterrupted hours every night — by far the longest stretch of quality kip I have experienced in my entire adult life. I am as delighted as I am intrigued. Have I found a proven cure for my insomnia after all? Or swallowed the placebo effect of social media hype?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.1"&gt;&lt;div id="52d79fac-65de-4a97-b513-9ad8cc73b59d"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Lenny Kravitz, Gwyneth Paltrow and Taylor Swift are all magnesium fans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;LIA TOBY, DANIELE VENTURELLI, AXELLE/BAUER-GRIFFIN/GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;From heart health to nerve function: why magnesium is crucial to our health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Magnesium is a nutrient the body needs to stay healthy,” Dr Elise Dallas, a GP at the London General Practice, says. It is involved in more than 600 enzymatic reactions, including assisting nerve function, boosting heart health, supporting the immune system and repairing DNA. Most — 60 per cent — of our body’s magnesium is found in our bones, the rest in the muscles, the brain, soft tissues and fluids including blood. “Magnesium deficiency can increase the risk of developing several chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, dementia and osteoporosis,” Dr Sophie Bostock, founder of the website The Sleep Scientist, who helped the NHS develop its clinically proven sleep improvement programme Sleepio, says. But it is its connection with sleep that interests her most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;How does magnesium affect sleep? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium is believed to help sleep by regulating neurotransmitters, which help to “control how stress affects the body”, Bostock says. It assists the production of the “feelgood” neurotransmitter serotonin, activates gamma aminobutyric acid receptors that help to prevent overstimulation, reduces production of the stress hormone cortisol, encourages production of the hormone melatonin (which regulates our circadian rhythm) and helps to dilate our blood vessels so the body releases heat. “We need a temperature drop to fall asleep,” Dr Kat Lederle, a sleep specialist who is also at the London General Practice, explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Eat pumpkin seeds and dark chocolate for a magnesium-rich diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you’re eating a healthy diet it should be easy to meet the NHS guidelines of 300mg magnesium a day for men and 270mg for women without a supplement. Good food sources include nuts, brown rice, fish, meat, dairy products, leafy green vegetables and dark chocolate. Magnesium is often added to breakfast cereals and is abundant in pumpkin seeds (a 28g serving contains 156mg). However, one 2018 study found that 48 per cent of American adults were deficient, and meeting guidelines doesn’t necessarily mean you’re getting enough of the mineral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-to-sleep-better-good-nights-sleep-lpw6vfskn" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to get a good night’s sleep — and the real reasons you’re not&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Age, exercise and alcohol can affect magnesium levels &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A true vitamin or mineral deficiency is when blood levels of a substance are low, Dallas says. In the 18 months she’s been running a menopause clinic at her practice, only one out of hundreds of women has tested as magnesium deficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, Bostock says a blood test for deficiency is problematic because only a small amount of magnesium is stored in the blood, while the majority of magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues. Further complicating the issue of whether you may be deficient, she adds, is the fact that symptoms that could be attributed to magnesium deficiency,such as tiredness, irritability or anxiety, “can obviously have other causes”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;High salt, caffeine and alcohol consumption can impede our ability to retain magnesium, as can endurance exercise because we excrete magnesium through sweat and use more for muscle function. Last year, a systematic review in the Journal of Translational Medicine found that those who did intense exercise require 10 to 20 per cent more magnesium than sedentary people. Falling oestrogen levels during perimenopause, meanwhile, can reduce absorption, while stress has been found to “increase the rate of excretion of magnesium into the urine”, Bostock says. Dallas recommends that perimenopausal women and those who exercise a lot take a supplement. As a 46-year-old who works out every day and often feels stressed, I see why I might have been not getting enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Can a supplement really help? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The science is uncertain. One study of 46 adults found that taking a magnesium supplement a day for eight weeks improved total sleep time and sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep). Bostock points out, however, that “although [participants] fell asleep faster, they still took over an hour to fall asleep at the end of the trial. It wasn’t a miracle cure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.17"&gt;&lt;div id="facad8fb-98b1-4d7b-9c5d-9430bdb23b18"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Magnesium is not a sleeping pill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2023 systematic review of 7,582 people found an observational association between magnesium intake and better sleep. “It can improve sleep efficiency, though evidence is still limited,” Dallas says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Lederle cites a 2021 review that found that taking a magnesium supplement helped people to fall asleep 17 minutes faster, but asks, “What’s the practical value?” In other words, whether our sleep will increase by enough to actively improve how rested we feel the next day has not yet been proved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/better-sleep-foods-to-eat-pr5x3npzz" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The food to eat for better sleep — and what’s keeping you awake&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Why are there so many different forms of magnesium?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium can’t be taken in pure form as a supplement — it is combined with another substance and the different types supposedly offer different benefits. They include magnesium orotate (magnesium bound with orotic acid), linked to improved heart health, and magnesium taurate (magnesium bound with taurine), which research has shown may promote healthy blood pressure. Magnesium citrate, bound with citric acid, and magnesium glycinate, which I have been taking — a compound of magnesium with glycine, an amino acid itself linked to improved sleep in animal studies — are among the most easily absorbed and are marketed to improve sleep, although no study has yet proved their efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The biggest buzz surrounds magnesium L-threonate — magnesium and L-threonic acid, a water-soluble substance derived from vitamin C — which the Stanford neuroscientist Dr Andrew Huberman has recommended for improved sleep, and which animal research suggests may be the best way of improving magnesium concentration in brain cells. “It’s the only form that effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier, offering superior brain bioavailability,” Dallas, who takes it herself, says. But Bostock says there is limited evidence that it improves sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Magnesium oxide (magnesium and oxygen) has been used in most trials to date and is by far the most budget friendly — I was excited to see an own-label Morrisons pack of 45 for £3 in my local supermarket. But it has been shown to be the least absorbent and is more commonly used to treat indigestion and constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dallas suggests taking magnesium L-threonate, glycinate or citrate for sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/vitamin-d-b12-magnesium-how-much-per-day-v7qxxsq7r" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you getting enough Vitamin D, B12 and magnesium?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Are more expensive supplements any better?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The difference in price typically varies according to brand rather than magnesium type and Dallas won’t speculate on why some are more expensive — but I’d wager an expensive marketing budget and celebrity ambassadors play a part. She does say that “expensive brands aren’t necessarily better”, but advises against cheap brands on Amazon “because you don’t know what’s in them”. My £12.95 Nobi Nutrition bottle from Amazon comes with a full list of ingredients, however, and has been third-party tested, which Dallas says to look for when choosing a supplement. Supplement dosage is measured in terms of the total weight of the magnesium compound, of which the element, or pure magnesium, is usually only a small percentage. The dose listed on a label will often sound high — mine is 400mg — but this is the total weight of the magnesium compound, in my case magnesium and glycine. The actual magnesium in each dose is usually much lower — in mine it’s 72mg, or 27 per cent of my recommended daily allowance. The amount absorbed will vary from person to person and “magnesium is a safe supplement”, Dallas adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Can a magnesium bath like Gwyneth’s work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;There’s little evidence that magnesium sprays and creams can improve sleep, and while Epsom salts, a compound of magnesium sulphate — which Paltrow bathes in every night to get “all the energy of the day off” — are well documented as a sleep ritual, a 2017 review found bathing in it carried no significant benefits. “Some studies show taking it transdermally might work,” Lederle says, but there is “not sufficient” evidence and “too many variables. Popping a pill, [at least] you know what’s gone in.” For those who don’t like swallowing a supplement, magnesium gummies might be a better option, which Lenny Kravitz describes as “like I’m just eating candy”. He told New York magazine that he takes Natural Vitality’s Calm Magnesium Citrate Anti-Stress Gummies (£21.66 for 120, &lt;a href="https://www.naturalvitality.com/en-gb/collections/gummies?_pos=5&amp;amp;_psq=ma&amp;amp;_ss=e&amp;amp;_v=1.0" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;naturalvitality.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Instant results? It’s probably the placebo effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some supplement brands suggest we take magnesium before bed and I find this a comforting ritual. However, Lederle says, “it’s not a sleeping pill. You don’t take it and feel sleepy. It works by taking it on a regular basis to build levels.” Bostock adds that “it’s likely that a supplement will only help if you’re correcting a deficiency, and it could take a few weeks. I don’t think we have enough evidence to know whether it can have acute benefits in a day or two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Bostock suspects the speed and extent of sleep improvement reported by magnesium fans on social media suggests the placebo effect is “a more likely driver”. As she says: “If you believe something will help you sleep, your anxiety about not being able to sleep reduces and you fall asleep faster, and stay asleep for longer.” Given that I have slept better from day one, I suspect my more restful nights are the result of a combination of placebo and a corrected deficiency. But I’ll keep on taking it, for as long as it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNaDFnZFFNWFJvT0VKUTJsUlhKN1hyaVBEQkZqNWpjWkdxbTBhUm9iUDNsVWlKMjN0TlVCeXdZY1E3Y1BCLWJQdDljSDhleUViR1hUV0Q4TW9LcGxJMGxiYnZNNllrQVBHX2VLSE42a2FZRm51ekVnaE4yODFHWWxXOENhY21TODVtbWxZQnVwYTZIRkJ6MDc5Vi1oWFh3U1RGX29id3QwX1N2NHhMVFFIQkJMcmUwSEdINWhqMQ</guid></item><item><title>Nine ways to keep your brain healthy - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVzA1U0h5RTNLcEtzMmxfZXQzSm5DLXJ5R1RkM0lZZVNBUDhhLUdUYlBXR2dIQUhQbFdXdkxmUTRUTzlzS3ZseDhfeFREOUJQeXpoY0VJNFE4MFVaYlhHWjRndlBRNnN3R0gzLTRKZGFqaXNnbjZIRWp5WVdDOUpzcFlhaFNSVW9PSkV5NGctREFhSTZfTG1oSnpaQzc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 gJBkaT"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;span class="responsive__DropCap-sc-1pktst5-1 enuiNL"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ow do we best keep our brains healthy? According to Dr Sabine Donnai, founder of the Viavi longevity clinic, it is the small things we do every day that make the biggest difference to our brain health, preventing cognitive decline over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In fact, the latest research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/dementia-prevention-intervention-care" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;as many as 45 per cent of dementia cases could be delayed&lt;/a&gt; or prevented with help from some simple tweaks to our habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We are looking at marginal gains from changing aspects of our diet and daily activity as well as incorporating new habits,” she says. “It is never too late to start making these changes.” Here’s what she recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;1. Eat a balanced diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Scientists from the University of Warwick, the University of Cambridge and&lt;span&gt; Fudan University in China who examined the food preferences of 181,990 UK adults with an average age of 70 found that people who ate a more balanced diet had better cognitive function and memory than those on a reduced-carb, high-protein or plant-based diet. Their findings, published in the journal Nature Mental Health, also showed the balanced eaters also had better “brain morphology”, defined as higher amounts of grey matter, the outermost layer of the brain, which is responsible for controlling movement, memory and emotions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;2. Exercise daily, even if it’s just a walk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;People who are physically active are 20 per cent less likely to develop dementia than those who aren’t, according to the Alzheimer’s Society. “It doesn’t matter how you stay active but a combination of different types of exercise is probably best,” Donnai says. A daily walk is the best place to start, with a 2022 Jama Network study of 78,430 adults living in the UK showing that covering a daily total of 9,800 steps was optimal for lowering the risk of dementia but that even 3,800 steps a day at a faster pace led to a lower incidence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;3. Eat more berries (ideally organic)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study from King’s College London and the University of Reading published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that eating a handful of blueberries daily for three months led to benefits including improved memory and brain function in a group of healthy men and women aged 65 to 80. Donnai says that all berries are a great addition to a brain-healthy diet but that we should try to buy organic whenever possible. Last year an analysis of government figures by the campaign group Pesticide Action Network UK (Pan UK) found unwanted traces of the “for ever chemicals” PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), which hang around in the body, to be present in 95 per cent of 120 samples of strawberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;4. Have a serving of leafy greens daily&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A daily serving of leafy green veg, such as spinach, kale, cabbage and lettuce, is a must for a healthy brain diet. In a study of 960 older people with memory problems, a team from Rush University in Chicago and the Tufts Human Nutrition Research Centre in Boston found that those who ate one serving daily of leafy greens had rates of cognitive decline equivalent to them being 11 years younger cognitively than those who ate the least. Leafy green vegetables are a rich source of brain-friendly nutrients including folate, nitrate and lutein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/eat-more-protein-brain-depression-dementia-xc8btxjvh" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eat more protein: the new way to improve your brain function&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;5. Take regular saunas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers from Finland reporting in the journal Preventive Medicine Reports showed that those who visited a sauna at least 2-3 times a week had a 53 per cent lower risk of being diagnosed with dementia over the following two decades than non-sauna users. Donnai says that regular saunas might help to lower inflammation levels in the body, a known risk factor for cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;6. Eat more oily fish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Fish is a source of essential omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA, key micronutrients that enhance and protect the brain. A study of healthy midlifers published by American researchers in the journal Neurology showed that those who ate a variety of fish and had higher concentrations of omega-3 fats in their bloodstream had better brain structure and cognitive health in their forties and fifties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;7. Drizzle olive oil on your meals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Drizzling olive oil on salads and pasta dishes is a good habit to get into,” Donnai says. It contains predominantly monounsaturated fatty acids including the potent oleic acid, which is known to reduce inflammation in the brain. A team of Harvard scientists reporting in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology revealed that a daily teaspoon of olive oil was associated with a 12 per cent reduced risk of death from all causes, but highlighted the fact that there was also a connection between olive oil consumption and fewer deaths from degenerative brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;8. Cut out ultra-processed foods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers at the University of Liverpool and the University of Cambridge, reporting in the Journal of Neurology last year, concluded that a “high UPF consumption is associated with dementia”. A previous study involving 72,083 people from the UK Biobank cohort also found that those consuming more UPFs over ten years were at a greater risk of dementia. According to these researchers, highly processed diets tend to have low levels of nutrients, too much sugar and sodium, and may lead to inflammation, which can be bad for brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-avoid-microplastics-brain-bottled-water-23fr6pl58" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Want to avoid microplastics in your brain? Here’s how you could&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="responsive__Heading3-sc-4v1r4q-10 dxCaTt"&gt;9. Protect your blood-brain barrier&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a semi-permeable membrane that acts as a filter to keep harmful substances such as toxins and chemicals away from the brain. The BBB works well when fully intact but can be easily weakened by inflammation, smoking, pollution, head injury and acute or long-term illness such as hypertension and diabetes, which can damage blood vessels, including those that make up the BBB. If the BBB becomes defective it can speed up the accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau proteins, accelerating cognitive decline. However, there are many things we can do to preserve it. “Simple steps such as avoiding chemicals and additives as much as you can in cosmetics, cleaning products and food are helpful,” Donnai says. “Exercising daily and reducing stress in your life are also key steps to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p

by mimicking&lt;/a&gt; two hormones called GLP-1 and GIP, resulting in appetite suppression, increased production of insulin, greater insulin sensitivity and a reduction in the rate at which food is emptied from the stomach. The medication is available for weight loss to some people on the NHS and it can also be bought privately with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists at Eli Lilly, the company that makes Mounjaro, along with academic researchers have released two analyses of data from a three-year trial known as Surmount-1, throwing fresh light on the medication’s longer-term use. One analysis looked at trajectories of weight loss, the second at rebound after initial weight reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results, which are to be presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in Málaga next month and have yet to be peer reviewed, are based on data from about 700 participants who took tirzepatide in three different dose regimens during the 176-week study.

The team said the final average body weight reductions for these groups were 9.2%, 20.2% and 30.8% respectively. Each group encompassed around a third of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[The work] demonstrates that we can in some way predict total final weight loss from the speed of weight loss observed in the first months of treatment,” said Prof Luca Busetto, of the University of Padova in Italy, one of the scientists behind the first analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers said most of the participants maintained clinically meaningful weight reduction over the course of the study. This was supported by a second analysis that found that average time to the lowest weight reached was 22 months, at which point participants had lost 23.1% of their starting weight on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While some subsequently regained weight – despite continuing with the medication – participants had nonetheless lost 19.4% of their starting weight, on average, by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team added that 70% of participants regained less than 5% of their starting weight after hitting their lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the trial, said the finding of different weight loss trajectories could help give an indication of how much weight an individual might expect to lose in the long term. “That might be able to guide the need for some individuals to consider newer therapies, which are more potent, in the future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Simon Cork, of Anglia Ruskin University, said the other analysis demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of tirzepatide in maintaining weight loss, which would be of interest to health bodies “as the costs of treating obesity-related co-morbidities rise year on year”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cork also noted long-term effectiveness and safety studies for such drugs were now at odds with guidance, which limits their use to a maximum of two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings come as the Advertising Standards Authority announced that along with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the General Pharmaceutical Council, it had warned businesses that advertising prescription-only medications to the public was prohibited. This includes weight loss jabs such as Mounjaro, Wegovy and Saxenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among other examples, the rules cover paid-for ads on social media “such as image or video ads on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok”, sponsored searches on Google or other search engines, and ads by influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A Guardian investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/26/experts-concern-promotions-weight-loss-jabs-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; that weight-loss injections were being aggressively marketed to British consumers through often illegal promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQcnVZMHgtOWd1Q19wdkNhYURVendnM3p4X09oakF4dXQwaU1sUlBMSUFweUprUF96Ymx2eXdIVEZBUUlGRkRHbktXZW5FM2dEUDBvSTVPeWtOb0dmQXhvdWVtMGNsNHhRQWNCMENXZjZNcDFzcmFqSlFSM0ZrazJDZ2JzNzB1TWt4Y0x4SDVSUFZWMm1TRUY4eE50TUw1cFdfWEY3d3ZteDR6WHhlZ3ZZdm9yQzVyYWV3RDFoNkFadS0</guid></item><item><title>This Underrated Nutrient Could Help Lower Your Colon Cancer Risk by 30%, New Study Says - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE0yNU9yRm83X3oxdlZTVF9uV09qT0hZM2VXLXdka04xMGxwVThneEVzdlhBU0F1SGZOeDhSR3EtZVpsWDNsVGN0R3oxY2ZLc3RBZjROYTMzcFEzZm5JNHpaWms2X0s4Yzc1VUF5Y2tqamxXQnRSUkZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moderate iron consumption may help lower your risk of colorectal cancers like colon cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colorectal cancer is one of the three most diagnosed cancers in men and women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more plant-based iron may lower colon cancer risk by 30%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It ranks as the third most diagnosed cancer in men and the second in women, with nearly 2 million new cases reported in 2020.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Specifically in Korea, colorectal cancer rates have been rising quickly, increasing by about 2.6% each year since 2019.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it is true that there are some factors that are out of our control when it comes to colon cancer risk, other factors, including smoking, drinking excess alcohol, lack of exercise and dietary choices, can be controlled. Recently, scientists have suggested that eating red and processed meats (like bacon) might increase the risk of colon cancer. One possible reason for that connection is the heme iron these foods contain. Heme iron is a type of iron found in animal-based foods, which is more easily absorbed by the body than non-heme iron found in plant-based sources. While there are benefits to leaning on heme iron, some researchers suggest they may contribute to harmful reactions in the body that increase cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, research on the link between heme iron and colon cancer has shown mixed results, with some studies suggesting a higher risk in Western countries and others showing little to no risk, especially in Asian countries like Japan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These findings highlight that the relationship may vary based on factors like gender, location and eating habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore how different types of iron in the diet, such as iron from animal sources (heme iron) and plant sources (non-heme iron), are linked to the risk of colorectal cancer in a large group of healthy Koreans, researchers conducted a study evaluating this population, and the results were published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate the associations between total, heme, and non-heme iron intake and the risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in Koreans, researchers used data from The Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study’s Health Examinees cohort (KoGES HEXA), a long-term research project carried out in health centers and hospitals across Korea. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the beginning of the study, researchers assessed what the participants typically ate over the past year using detailed interviews and a food questionnaire. This questionnaire asked how often participants ate certain foods and how much they usually ate. The questionnaire included 106 common foods in the Korean diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers then calculated the iron content of these foods, measuring two types of dietary iron for each participant: heme iron, which comes from animal-based foods like meat and fish, and non-heme iron, found in plant-based foods and other sources. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cases of colorectal cancer in this study were identified using data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry, managed by the National Cancer Center of Korea. Additional data were collected about participants’ age, sex, smoking and drinking habits, education level, family history of colorectal cancer and any history of conditions like hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol. Information on physical activity was also gathered through questionnaires, while height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all of this information, analyses were conducted to determine potential links. In total, 109,908 people (37,697 men and 71,401 women) were tracked for an average of 9.1 years, and their information was used for this analysis. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; During the study, 608 new cases of colorectal cancer (CRC) were diagnosed (299 in men and 309 in women). Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;people who consumed moderate amounts of iron daily&lt;/strong&gt; had a noticeably lower risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to those who consumed the least amount of iron. For colon cancer specifically, moderate iron consumption also correlated to a lower risk. In this study, a moderate amount of iron was classified as 5.00–6.27 mg per day—that's about as much as you'd get in a serving of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/279978/one-pot-lentils-rice-with-spinach/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One-Pot Lentils &amp;amp; Rice with Spinach&lt;/a&gt;. (That's just a fraction of your recommended daily value, which varies depending on age and sex.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it came to heme iron consumption, the researchers didn’t see a noticeable effect on the risk of developing colorectal or colon cancer. But for non-heme iron consumption, the researchers found that people in the group with moderate non-heme iron intake had a lower risk of colorectal cancer compared to those with the lowest consumption. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, for those who consumed a moderate amount of non-heme iron: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;their risk of CRC was reduced by 25%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;their risk of colon cancer was reduced by 30%. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the men in the moderate non-heme group, the effects were even more significant. Men who consumed a moderate amount of non-heme iron had a 32% lower risk of CRC and a 44% lower risk of colon cancer. Additionally, as non-heme iron intake increased, there was a noticeable trend of lower colon cancer risk for both sexes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s interesting to note that the benefits of iron, particularly non-heme iron (plant-based iron), don’t increase steadily with higher consumption. Instead, the most protective effects were seen in a moderate intake range in this study. The researchers propose that this might be because iron consumption in Korea is generally quite low. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To put things into perspective, the recommended daily amount of iron is 8 mg for adult men and women over 51, and 18 mg for adult women under 50.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But for the lowest consumption group in this study, some participants were only getting between 1 and 5 mg of iron per day, which is far below the recommended amount.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors highlight that having too little iron has been linked to a higher risk of certain cancers, and this may be why strong benefits were not seen among those with the lowest intake of this nutrient. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all studies, this one has some limitations to be aware of. This study is observational, and observational studies often face challenges with confounding variables, like overall diet. Another limitation is that the researchers only measured dietary habits at the start of the study, so any changes in eating patterns over time weren’t taken into account. The study also neglected to collect information about any iron supplements that participants may have been taking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hearing headlines linking eating red meat to cancer can be alarming. But this study underscores how understanding the nuanced results of studies can help make informed dietary choices without overhauling your eating habits entirely. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, while these findings don’t conclusively link heme iron intake to colon cancer risk, it’s worth being mindful of your overall diet. Many Americans consume more meat than the recommended amounts, which could lead to overconsumption of heme iron along with other factors like saturated fats and calories that may contribute to health concerns.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t mean you need to cut out meat altogether—instead, focus on portion control and balancing your meals with plenty of plant-based foods, which are rich in other nutrients (like fiber—a nutrient that may be linked to a reduced risk of colorectal cancer).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whenever you think about making a change to your eating habits, it’s crucial to consider your whole diet rather than just one nutrient. This study highlights that moderate, diversified consumption of both heme and non-heme iron might offer protective benefits, particularly in populations where overall iron intake tends to be lower. Incorporating iron-rich plant-based foods like lentils, spinach and tofu can support a well-rounded diet while offering additional advantages, such as dietary fiber and phytonutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t overdo it with this mineral—too much may not be a good thing for your body. But by taking small, practical steps, you can build a diet that’s both enjoyable and supportive of your health goals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on the nuanced relationship between iron intake and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, particularly in a Korean population. The findings underscore the importance of balance, as moderate iron consumption, both heme and non-heme, was associated with a reduced risk of CRC and colon cancer. This research emphasizes that dietary habits, cultural context, and baseline nutrient consumption levels play a vital role in interpreting study results and shaping dietary recommendations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the study highlights potential protective effects of moderate iron intake, it also reminds us of the dangers of both under- and over-consumption. These findings reinforce the value of a well-rounded diet that includes a mix of nutrient-dense foods, emphasizing plant-based sources of iron alongside moderate portions of animal-based options.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;State health officials reported Friday the number of measles cases in Oklahoma has risen to 12.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine of the cases are confirmed and three are probable cases, which means patients show symptoms consistent with the national standard definition but lack a test result or a link to a laboratory-confirmed case.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oklahoma State Department of Health’s measles update also included two new risk-of-exposure notices in Oklahoma City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first location is Northwest Pediatrics of Oklahoma City, an outpatient clinic in the Mercy Plaza Building, 4140 W Memorial Rd. The exposure risk occurred 10:45 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 4. The OSDH worked with the clinic to identify individuals with a known exposure risk and will notify these individuals directly of their exposure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second location is the Aldi grocery store at 6965 Northwest Expressway. If you visited the location between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. April 6 and are unvaccinated, unsure of vaccine or immune status, or have concerns, health officials encourage you to provide your name and contact information on &lt;a href="https://redcap.health.ok.gov/surveys/?s=7N3ANHYJTT"&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;, and someone from the health department will contact you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals who are possibly exposed and not immune through vaccination or prior infection should exclude themselves from public settings for 21 days from the date of their potential exposure, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last previous risk-of-exposure notice was for people who were at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital OU Health’s main entrance atrium, atrium elevators to the lower level and emergency department between 6:15 and 10 p.m. March 23.

                                &lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife has issued a warning related to a virus that's been popping up among the state's raccoons, with that virus resulting in a highly contagious and fatal disease that can be passed to dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Colorado Parks and Wildlife, multiple raccoons in the San Luis Valley area have tested positive for canine distemper in recent weeks. Canine distemper is a disease that's spread via a virus, most commonly passed along through direct contact with an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of canine distemper can vary and may not be obvious, though it typically results in animals having difficulty moving and can result in abnormal behavior due to a brain infection. Other symptoms include crusting around the eyes and nose, coughing, diarrhea, vomiting, and thickening of the paw pads. Once an animal contracts the disease, it usually does not survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another particularly odd symptom associated with raccoons and distemper is that it can result in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildlifephotography/comments/vdktna/wild_raccoon_showing_signs_of_distemper/" target="_blank"&gt;glowing green eyes&lt;/a&gt; – no joke (read more about symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.delawarehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Distemper-.FAQ_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raccoons that tested positive for canine distemper were found in Alamosa and Monte Vista, though it's worth noting that other recent reports have indicated that the disease has been found among raccoon populations elsewhere in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife stressed the importance of getting pets vaccinated and to avoid allowing animals to interact with wildlife. It was also suggested that people work to keep wildlife from frequenting their backyards and to avoid leaving out water and food that could become contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just dogs and raccoons that can be impacted either. While the disease doesn't pass to humans, Colorado species including coyotes, foxes, skunks, and other wild carnivores can contract it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected. It mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from about 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and rarely, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can happen even in healthy people, but those at highest risk include: infants and children under 5 years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems from medications or underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing about 97% protection against measles.

			&lt;p&gt;Old age awaits everyone, but it hits some harder – and earlier – than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way we age hinges partly on factors beyond our control, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-discovered-a-subtle-genetic-imbalance-that-may-drive-aging"&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-is-far-more-dangerous-than-all-the-violence-in-the-world-study-shows"&gt;exposure to pollutants&lt;/a&gt;. But research suggests we can still influence the outcome with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;key behaviors&lt;/a&gt;, especially in how we sleep, exercise, and eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new 30-year study, researchers have taken an in-depth look at the links between eating habits and healthy aging, which they define as reaching age 70 without major chronic diseases or declines in cognitive, physical, or mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is among the first to analyze multiple dietary patterns in middle age in relation to overall healthy aging, explains co-author Frank Hu, epidemiologist at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Studies have previously investigated dietary patterns in the context of specific diseases or how long people live," Hu &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "Ours takes a multifaceted view, asking, 'How does diet impact people's ability to live independently and enjoy a good quality of life as they age?'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hu and his colleagues used longitudinal data from 105,000 adults between the ages of 39 and 69 (averaging 53 years old), collected between 1986 and 2016 as part of the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects regularly completed dietary questionnaires over the 30-year period. The authors of the new study scored their eating habits by adherence to eight dietary patterns, seeking to learn which is most likely to promote healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight dietary patterns are: the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/scoring-highly-on-alternative-healthy-eating-index-lowers-risk-for-many-illnesses-202202082681"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt; (AHEI), the Alternative Mediterranean Index (aMED), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DASH_diet"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt;), the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-diet-created-by-scientists-has-been-linked-to-better-cognitive-performance-in-the-elderly"&gt;MIND&lt;/a&gt;), the healthful plant-based diet (hPDI), the Planetary Health Diet Index (PHDI), the empirically inflammatory dietary pattern (EDIP), and the empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eight dietary patterns share some basic inclinations, the researchers note, such as a focus on whole, plant-based foods and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to those eight patterns, the study examined subjects' consumption of ultra-processed foods – industrial creations often featuring many ingredients and excessive sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found 9,771 participants met their definition of healthy aging, representing 9.3 percent of the sample population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eight dietary patterns were associated with healthy aging, the study found, so adhering to any one of them raised a person's odds of staying spry at 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This suggests the solution isn't simple, the researchers note, and no single diet is best for everyone. That said, one contender did stand out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best diet overall for healthy aging is the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/scoring-highly-on-alternative-healthy-eating-index-lowers-risk-for-many-illnesses-202202082681"&gt;AHEI&lt;/a&gt;, according to the findings. It's similar to the older Healthy Eating Index, the researchers explain, but more oriented toward preventing chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects in the top quintile for the AHEI were 86 percent more likely to achieve healthy aging at 70 than those in the lowest quintile, the study found. If the cutoff age was 75, the top quintile was 2.24 times likelier to age healthily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AHEI emphasizes plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes, while minimizing red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened drinks, sodium, and refined grains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since staying active and independent is a priority for both individuals and public health, research on healthy aging is essential," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Marta Guasch-Ferré, Harvard nutritionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that dietary patterns rich in plant-based foods, with moderate inclusion of healthy animal-based foods, may promote overall healthy aging and help shape future dietary guidelines," she &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the AHEI showed the best results, it was closely followed by several others, including the aMED, DASH, PHDI, and MIND, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the strongest link to overall healthy aging, the AHEI had the strongest link with maintaining physical function and mental health. The PHDI showed the strongest link with maintaining cognitive health and surviving to age 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher consumption of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/added-sugar-in-your-diet-may-speed-up-your-bodys-biological-aging"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, was associated with a lower likelihood of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings also show that there is no one-size-fits-all diet. Healthy diets can be adapted to fit individual needs and preferences," &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/healthy-eating-in-midlife-linked-to-overall-healthy-aging/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author Anne-Julie Tessier, nutritionist at the University of Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03570-5"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As the infectious dose of &lt;em&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/em&gt; O1 has been estimated to be 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;8 &lt;/sup&gt;[100,000 to 100 million] colony-forming units (CFU), this suggests the holy water was heavily contaminated and bacteria remained viable at ambient temperature during the flight and in Europe," the German and UK researchers who authored the report wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global plague&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing indicated that the cholera strain that the travelers brought home was a particularly nasty one. &lt;em&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/em&gt; O1, which is linked to other recent outbreaks in Eastern and Middle Africa, is resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics, namely: fluroquinolones, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, macrolides, and sulphonamides. The strain also carried a separate genetic element (a plasmid) that provided resistance mechanisms against streptomycin and spectinomycin, cephalosporins, macrolides, and sulphonamides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main treatment for cholera, which causes profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, is oral rehydration. Antibiotics are sometimes used to reduce severity. Fortunately, this strain was still susceptible to the antibiotic tetracycline, one of the drugs of choice for cholera. However, there are reports of other cholera strains in Africa that have also acquired tetracycline resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, "The extension of a cholera outbreak in Africa causing a cluster of infections in Europe is unusual," the authors write. They call for travelers to be aware of infectious threats when eating and drinking abroad—and to not ingest holy water. Clinicians should also be aware of the potential of cholera in travelers to Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly fight cholera outbreaks, though, there needs to be sustained investment in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Cases of cholera have surged globally after the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-09-2024-data-show-marked-increase-in-annual-cholera-deaths"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Low-income countries will continue to need overseas development aid support to control outbreaks and epidemics using effective WASH, surveillance, communications, diagnostics and countermeasure programmatic delivery," the authors of the Eurosurveillance report write.&lt;/p&gt;

Packed with fibre, vitamins, and minerals, its nutrient-dense profile and whole-grain goodness make it a perfect choice for wellness enthusiasts. But this seemingly wholesome food carries a hidden risk that many don't talk about. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.70008" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in published in the journal Risk Analysis warns that brown rice has a toxic metal that could have serious consequences for brain health, especially in young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Michigan State University have discovered that brown rice has 15 percent higher levels of arsenic, a toxic metal associated with cancer and brain damage. This wouldn't affect a healthy adult so much, but it could be troublesome for brain development in young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which age group is at risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hidden arsenic in brown rice could be detrimental for children between the ages of six to 24 months. Children eating them had twice the estimated arsenic exposure compared to those consuming white rice in similar quantities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens when young children are exposed to arsenic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When young children are exposed to arsenic, it can interfere with their brain development. This exposure is linked to lower IQ, learning difficulties, and behavioral issues. Studies have associated it with higher risks of autism and ADHD. Even low levels, over time, can have lasting effects on cognitive and neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4026128/#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20studies%20have,the%20most%20affected%20cognitive%20skill." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have shown that arsenic can lead to cognitive deficits in children, even at low concentrations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a period of time, the long-term exposure to arsenic can increase cancer risk. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds as “carcinogenic to humans.” These chemicals can cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, and skin cancer. Some studies also link it to kidney cancer, liver cancer and prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research is important because it acknowledges the importance of considering food safety along with nutrition when consumers make choices about food. While we found that choosing brown rice over white rice would result in higher arsenic exposure on average, the levels should not cause long-term health problems unless someone ate an enormous amount of brown rice every day for years," said Felicia Wu, a professor at the university and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why brown rice has more arsenic than white rice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens because unlike white rice, in case of brown rice, the outer brown layer of the grain called rice bran is not removed. This is where the arsenic is accumulated in higher concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice brain is removed in case of white rice, which reduces arsenic concentration, thus lessening risk of complications due to arsenic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers compared arsenic exposure from brown and white rice, they found that 48 percent of the arsenic in brown rice was in the more toxic inorganic form, compared to 33 percent in white rice, posing a greater potential health risk. Arsenic exists in two main forms: inorganic and organic, and the difference between them lies in both their chemical composition and toxicity. Inorganic arsenic is the more harmful of the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown rice grown in the rest of the world had a 65 percent inorganic concentration level while white rice also had a 53 percent concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outer layer of the rice that makes it brown contains arsenic concentrations 10 times higher than the rice endosperm, which is the white interior portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also found that infants and toddlers between the ages of six to 24 months who consumed brown rice might ingest arsenic at levels of 0.29 to 0.59 micrograms per kilogram of body weight every day far higher than the recommended safe limit of 0.21 micrograms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rice bran and brown rice are shown to have a higher arsenic content and inorganic arsenic concentration than the grain endosperm or white rice," the researchers concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study finds low glycemic index diet helps heart patients lose weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 18:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Cancer dietitian reveals controversial snack that wards off cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQR0JxeDBLNk92aVJzX1ZZVVBXSWZacU9fY3Z2RlBtRm0xTVlTRFZsNGJqN1o0TzN4RjJaOEZJeW00X2VwelduNENGY0NEczNGMUhlODNYcmZqZFR5bmd0QjZ6bnZTZlBwZV80cUtDdXVwSnFMZ0E2VTJicm5ldEdyR3RlenRNLTBVMld3NXBNeTlDeFBqOFdzTNIBngFBVV95cUxQN3RyWmEzLTI5UnJLY1RuQmVoOW9nOHI4Mml1d1JySUNmVXY0bkMxTHBybFJvb1RtV3NQeW00SlFNLTNGdHc3LXp3Zi1QT2pId2xRQUZ2WGtFMUtncnpQcG8wMjZWeU5BNmhVSzlLTEZIWHo0MlpIeWlFcDR3Q3g4b1VfcUFuVzEtMmRmelpVTWg0ckhHYUZJQUd2ZThkQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-35b84930-16ef-11f0-b629-21169ba05b5e"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; dietician claims that a simple, budget-friendly snack can help protect against the disease — but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14547143/Jenny-McCarthy-dying-vegan-diet-carnivore.html"&gt;meat lovers might be left wanting. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nichole Andrews, 38, a registered dietician and nutritionist specializing in oncology for the past 15 years, says that a combination of carrots, peppers, peas, olives and string cheese can stave off your chances of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14596467/weight-loss-mom-stage-3-colon-cancer-age-38.html"&gt;developing cancer. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Photos of the lackluster combo in a small bowl aren't the most appetizing, but the expert told her 200,000 &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-bf81d7e0-16fd-11f0-a653-e3c58c7a709d"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers: 'It's going to keep you full, it's going to keep you satisfied, and you're going to feel refreshed and good after it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is my favorite snack, I have it multiple times a week in the afternoon. And the best part: it's going to help you reduce cancer risk.'    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Costing less than $3 per serving, she claims that the healthy fats from the cheese, antioxidants in the olives and the fiber from the vegetables can do wonders for the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Every bite of fruit and vegetable – fresh, frozen, or canned – reduces your risk of cancer and recurrence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The short clip shows Andrews preparing some carrots, peppers and snap peas by washing them under water, chopping them and adding it to a bowl with Kalamata olives and a piece of string cheese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also noted that it is not necessary for the vegetables to be organic for them to be beneficial.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nichole Andrews, 38, a registered cancer dietician claims that this simple, budget-friendly snack can help keep the disease at bay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carrots are packed with beta-carotene, an antioxidant scientists believe may protect cells from damage and slow the growth of cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Filled with essential nutrients, including vitamin K and vitamin A, the vegetable can help reduce inflammation in the body, which is a driver of cancers forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, peppers also offer excellent sources of vitamins A and C, particularly red peppers as they also contain fiber, potassium and folic acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can protect cells from damage that could lead to cancer, maintain cardiovascular health to prevent heart and blood related cancers and improve eye health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folic acid also plays an important role in managing cell growth and division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is essential for producing the building blocks of DNA, the genetic material of our cells, maintains DNA stability and repair damaged DNA - therefore protecting cells from damage and ensuring that their reproductive cycle is maintained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While peas are a great source of plant-based protein and fiber - supporting digestion, heart health, olives are filled with monounsaturated fats and antioxidants which can significantly reduce the risk of developing cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber helps push out stool, clearing the digestive system of harmful toxins links to bowel and other cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Filled with Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin E and Zinc, peas can protect against plaque formation along blood vessel walls, which can cause disruptions in blood flow, create clots and cause inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A  combination of carrots, peppers, peas, olives and string cheese can stave off your chances of developing cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, magnesium, potassium, and other minerals found in peas can lower your risk of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Green peas also contain saponins, plant compounds known for having anti-cancer effects by preventing tumor growth and inducing cell death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, olives are filled with antioxidants such as like oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol that can neutralize and destroy cancerous cells in the body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combined with vegetables, the savory fruit can help prevent DNA damage and maintain the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite common notion, cheese is a healthy source of calcium, fat, Vitamins A and B12, along with zinc and phosphorus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The American Cancer Society at least 40 percent of all cancer cases and nearly 50 percent of cancer deaths in adults aged 30 years or older in the US are preventable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say that the calcium in cheese can help improve bone health, protein to build and maintain muscle tissue and some forms of aged cheeses also contain probiotics, which can benefit gut bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Andrews says that food is a key way to keep the disease at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know how amazing and powerful nutrition can be to help survivors have better treatment outcomes and reduce risk of recurrence,' Nichole, who is based in Tri-Cities, Washington, US, previously told Need To Know of her work in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sadly there is so much misinformation out there, that people cannot eat well – so I am so happy to clear up that confusion and help people eat with confidence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society at least 40 percent of all cancer cases and nearly 50 percent of cancer deaths in adults aged 30 years or older in the US are preventable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The average patient age was 7.8 years, and 51.4% were male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56284-0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;findings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative to controls, children and adolescents who had COVID-19 were at significantly greater risk for high blood pressure (1.5% vs 1.1% in controls), abnormal ventricular rhythms (0.9% vs 0.7%), myocarditis (0.1% vs 0.02%), heart failure (1.6% vs 1.2%), cardiomyopathy (0.6% vs 0.4%), cardiac arrest (0.5% vs 0.4%), thromboembolism (0.9% vs 0.7%), chest pain (1.2% vs 0.6%), and palpitations (0.4% vs 0.3%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to timely referrals, diagnostic evaluations, and management to mitigate long-term cardiovascular complications in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were similar in patients with and without CHDs, but those with CHDs had a higher risk of atrial fibrillation.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Risks were consistent regardless of age, sex, race, obesity status, COVID-19 severity, and SARS-CoV-2 variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the CHD group had higher absolute risks of any post-COVID cardiovascular outcome than those without CHDs (5.6% for infected patients vs 4.0% for controls with CHD; 2.2% and 1.3%, respectively, in those without CHD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even children and adolescents without a history of any cardiovascular outcomes before SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks, suggesting a broad potential impact on those previously considered at low risk of cardiovascular disease," the study authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Awareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to timely referrals, diagnostic evaluations, and management to mitigate long-term cardiovascular complications in children and adolescents," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No difference on cardiac testing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The second &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-025-10774-0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, published this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; followed up with 1,080 adult participants from a COVID-19 registry in Poland after infection with a pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant or Omicron up to January 2022. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A follow-up visit at 3 to 6 months post-infection consisted of symptom monitoring and testing with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), Holter electrocardiography (ECG), and echocardiography. A total of 504 patients also took the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) test and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) starting in June 2022.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The average patient age was 56.9 years, 68.9% were women, 75.2% were vaccinated against COVID-19, 53.1% were infected during Omicron predominance, 44.4% had high blood pressure (hypertension), and 18.0% had abnormal cholesterol levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least one of the analyzed symptoms was noted in 586 patients (54.3%, including patients with any COVID-19 severity), indicating cardiac long COVID; those without cardiac symptoms served as controls. The most common symptom was fatigue (38.9%). Palpitations occurred in 17.6% of patients, and 1.8% reported fainting episodes. Nearly half of patients had only one cardiac symptom (45.7%), while 0.6% had all investigated symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients with palpitations had stronger premature ventricular contractions than those without palpitations, but they also had lower average systolic and diastolic blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The comparative analysis of adults with and without cardiac long COVID showed no differences on ABPM, Holter ECG, or echocardiography. The lack of difference may be due to the asymptomatic nature of some cardiac complications and a too-short follow-up to allow cardiac damage to be reflected on standard cardiovascular tests, the researchers said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Link between mental illness, cardio symptoms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients with cardiac symptoms had higher scores on the PHQ-2 and GAD-2 and higher percentages of responses indicating increased risk of anxiety or depression. In this group, 290 (57.4%) reported one or more analyzed symptoms. Patients with PHQ-2 scores of at least 3 had higher heart rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients with or without comorbidities should still undergo regular cardiological checks to detect potential later complications, such as long-term cardiovascular symptoms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Potential mechanisms linking mental illness to cardiovascular symptoms in long-COVID patients may include chronic inflammation, autonomic nervous system dysregulation, and endothelial dysfunction, the authors said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Prolonged stress and anxiety can lead to elevated cortisol levels, which may exacerbate hypertension and arrhythmias," they wrote. "Additionally, shared pathways such as oxidative stress and immune dysregulation could further explain the interplay between these conditions, which is critical for developing holistic and integrated treatment strategies."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Risk factors for cardiac long COVID were female sex, asthma, and COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Patients with or without comorbidities should still undergo regular cardiological checks to detect potential later complications, such as long-term cardiovascular symptoms," the authors advised. "Clinical practice should also include broad patient education, informing them about potential cardiovascular symptoms after COVID-19 infection, regardless of the dominant variant, and emphasizing the importance of early reporting of any concerning symptoms." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Justin Stebbing, Professor of Biomedical Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Justin Stebbing, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;writing on The Conversation website&lt;/a&gt; explained that a recent study had found that it could have a protective impact against cancers developing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors have admitted that the big increase in colorectal cancer cases among people under 55 is causing concern - it has doubled globally in the last few years. It is thought that diet is a big factor in this - especially the rise of ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prof Stebbing said: “As a consultant oncologist, many people have asked me how their risk can be reduced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The emerging evidence suggests that regular yoghurt consumption may have a protective effect against certain aggressive forms of colorectal cancer by modifying the gut microbiome, the natural bacteria that live in the gut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in overall health, influencing digestion, immune function and even cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The gut bacteria can live inside cancer itself, and in general a healthy balance of these bacteria is thought to be essential for maintaining a strong immune system and preventing inflammation, which can contribute to cancer development.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason Prof Stebbing thinks yoghurt can help is because it contains live cultures of beneficial bacteria, such as lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, which can help maintain this balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said: “The study found that consuming two or more servings of yoghurt per week was associated with a lower risk of a specific type of aggressive colorectal cancer, which occurs on the right side of the colon and is associated with poorer survival outcomes compared with cancers on the left side.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Research analysed 150,000 people&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study analysed data from over 150,000 participants followed for several decades, indicating that long-term yoghurt consumption may alter the gut microbiome in ways that protect against certain cancers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed the participants every two years about their yoghurt intake, and measured the amount of Bifidobacterium (a type of bacteria found in yoghurt) in the tumour tissue of 3,079 people within the sample who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While yoghurt did not directly lower the risk for all types of colorectal cancer, those who ate two or more servings of yoghurt per week had a lower risk of developing “Bifidobacterium-positive proximal colon cancer”, a type of colorectal cancer that occurs in the right side of the colon and has one of the lowest survival rates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nutritional scientist Prof Tim Spector, founder of the Zoe app, said he eats yoghurt “most days of the week” as it is ideal for a healthy gut microbiome - something that can aid digestion and keep your immune system strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tim said: “For yoghurts I never go for fat-free products. I don’t like the taste of them and they’re not good for my sugar spikes either.” In the video caption he added: “By choosing fat containing yoghurts I feel fuller for longer and I also prefer the taste.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yoghurt has calcium meanign it’s good for bones and staving off osteoporosis. Regular yoghurt consumption has also been associated with lower blood pressure and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Some studies suggest that yoghurt intake may help prevent type 2 diabetes and other diseases too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cases of bowel cancer&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are nearly 45,000 cases of bowel cancer every year in the UK, making it the nation’s fourth most common cancer, and third worldwide – but many of these are preventable. According to Cancer Research UK data, 54% of all bowel cancers could be prevented by having a healthier lifestyle. Smoking, lack of exercise, alcohol, eating processed meat, and poor diet are all significant factors in the development of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPTV90NElKbzVOWlZ0UzRaMW1UajlVU3NNcjJXTTVzTXBCWk95YzkwWlN0NmNRMzVZSTBDOXBzZ3ZhRUFaQXlTSXBrWmwzcXBVT25vc0tydmM2TkVnQmNXeUhLN3UxMk12VnVDQ3A1elFQbHFyc1h0RjRwNjlEYjR6allxcHFicnBJNF9n0gGQAUFVX3lxTFBIdkJqenJ2M0RjakR0dEVHeFRlV2lsaXFBaE5zNFlBYnVDWnNHNTBZSEtiNWVzVU14REI4azJjQWFYUmhpRktfdVpwbVVDSnVpdGdUTkJzNF9qNEc3dHA2ZEdldVhZZFVpWDRLMW1PdXpDOUxyUHFIYmNfSlZ0Yi16Ulh1bnVNNEJTMDhFSVNJSg</guid></item><item><title>Oncology expert says eat this for breakfast every day to stop killer bowel cancer - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPTV90NElKbzVOWlZ0UzRaMW1UajlVU3NNcjJXTTVzTXBCWk95YzkwWlN0NmNRMzVZSTBDOXBzZ3ZhRUFaQXlTSXBrWmwzcXBVT25vc0tydmM2TkVnQmNXeUhLN3UxMk12VnVDQ3A1elFQbHFyc1h0RjRwNjlEYjR6allxcHFicnBJNF9n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist has spoken about how the risk of lethal bowel cancer can be drastically reduced by having one thing for breakfast each day.

Smoking, lack of exercise, alcohol, eating processed meat, and poor diet are all significant factors in the development of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPTV90NElKbzVOWlZ0UzRaMW1UajlVU3NNcjJXTTVzTXBCWk95YzkwWlN0NmNRMzVZSTBDOXBzZ3ZhRUFaQXlTSXBrWmwzcXBVT25vc0tydmM2TkVnQmNXeUhLN3UxMk12VnVDQ3A1elFQbHFyc1h0RjRwNjlEYjR6allxcHFicnBJNF9n</guid></item><item><title>Weekly measles cases top 90 in U.S. for first time in years - CBS News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOZWl0LUpkU3ZQQlVjb1llTWRIU25EdkpTTVNQay1YSkVqcHJtY3BZXzBQRnZJWkt6U2plOXQ2LXcwRzctTmd6Y3lRSEg0TlNINXN6d09RZjUtVTVwMXJRdnpyTGVXbldXalF3c25lU21PU3RsYzc2bkZSbUJ0ODFUdmFVSi3SAYoBQVVfeXFMTXZwRlpTdU0tZXM0MFhCVTV3bEVWOWMyb3pabjRoSnBZa1F4N09xaDlqc1VneDFwZ1VObmZmQVlad3RQNVhxQ2Q2di1rYUs0U2VsVnpBcjhUNk1JNE52SEQxWXZURm1VajFPdl81OFlyV3dURXB1dnlHMWNrSXRUMll5TDk0Znl5ZkhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in a single week has topped 90 for the first time since a record wave &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety-one cases of measles were reported with rashes that began the week of March 23, with Arkansas, Hawaii and Indiana joining the list of two dozen states with confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week of March 30, 81 cases were reported, and another 21 cases were reported for the following week. But those figures are expected to rise as more cases are confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, at least 712 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. — the second-highest number of cases reported in a single year since the 1990s. Nearly 30,000 measles cases were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001999.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported in 1990&lt;/a&gt;, largely due to gaps in vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, there were 1,274 confirmed measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC said Friday there have been seven local outbreaks of the virus in the U.S., up from six last week. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring New Mexico remains the country's largest, with nearly 600 cases between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about the new outbreaks. The agency &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-texas-measles-outbreak-layoffs-rfk-vaccines/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; outbreaks had been reported in Texas and New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's update came a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described his strategy for handling the current outbreak as a success, even after a third death of an unvaccinated American was linked to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our numbers in this country have now plateaued. And I want to thank CDC for that," Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy compared the nation's measles figures to those in Europe, which &lt;a href="https://measles-rubella-monthly.ecdc.europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;has seen&lt;/a&gt; thousands more measles cases and several more deaths. Health officials there have been grappling with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;record measles&lt;/a&gt; cases in recent years due to steep gaps in vaccination rates in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike in Europe, prolonged local outbreaks of measles had been declared eliminated in the Americas. Officials &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-americas-risk-losing-elimination-status/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;have warned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that this year's outbreaks in the region are now threatening that public health achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also told President Trump at the Cabinet meeting, "We're trying to refocus the press. We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One CDC official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, warned that any apparent slowdown in recent measles cases should be treated with caution. Challenges in quickly identifying and reporting cases from the outbreaks can distort figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During outbreaks, weekly measles cases almost always appear to be lower in more recent weeks due to reporting delays, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some travelers to Texas and Kansas are also now being advised to get a second or early dose of the measles vaccine, the CDC said in a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-vaccine-cdc-texas-kansas-travel/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;letter to health departments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this week, marking the first time in years that the CDC has published these kinds of vaccination recommendations for domestic travel within the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current increase in measles cases in the United States is due to people returning to the United States from international trips with measles and an expanding outbreak among communities with low vaccination coverage in Texas and other states," the CDC wrote in its letter.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s not the only type of allergy threat getting worse with warming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are other allergens, like &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92178-z"&gt;mold spores&lt;/a&gt;, whose spread coincides with higher temperatures and weather disruption. But one of the most insidious and underrated dangers is now coming from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39755273/"&gt;stinging and biting insects&lt;/a&gt;. These wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and bees are showing up in new areas and in greater numbers as more places become suitable for their hives, nests, and colonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Insect allergies are much less common than pollen sensitivity across the population, but they can cause severe, deadly complications, and they are far less studied. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7227a6.htm"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, on average, 72 people in the United States died from insect allergies per year over the past decade. But insect allergies send &lt;a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/insect-sting-allergies/"&gt;thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; to the emergency room every year, and millions of people live with the fear that the next insect that lands on them could ruin their day. “From a public health point of view, it’s been heavily underserved,” said &lt;a href="https://annualmeeting.acaai.org/2024/conference_schedule.cfm?speakerCRMKey=5DD7EC8A-31F2-4849-8595-60032B1C2520&amp;amp;shared=true"&gt;David Golden&lt;/a&gt;, an allergy researcher and part-time faculty at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The result is that many people are experiencing allergic reactions from insects for the first time, sometimes unsure of where they’re coming from. Many doctors are also unaware of how to diagnose and treat insect allergies. And as the climate changes, the allergy threat from arthropods is likely to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-insect-allergies-are-on-the-rise" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why insect allergies are on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Changes in the climate are making the world more welcoming for insects that bite and sting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Warmer winters and earlier springs mean more critters like yellow jackets and hornets survive the cooler seasons and emerge early in the year in greater numbers. And as temperatures continue to rise, previously inhospitable parts of the country are becoming habitable for insects, allowing species like fire ants to migrate further north. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-navigate-our-buggier-world" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to navigate our buggier world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Allergies from stinging insects are getting worse as the climate changes, but there are some things you can do to keep your symptoms manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Reduce skin exposure with shoes, socks, and long sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Inspect the grass, shrubs, and nooks around your home for nests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Most insect repellent products don’t work on the most worrisome stinging insects, so it’s best to avoid the places where they live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Some pain, redness, and itchiness after a bite or sting is normal, but you should &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/insect-allergy/"&gt;get medical help&lt;/a&gt; if you experience larger rashes, dizziness, trouble breathing, swelling around the mouth, or stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Talk to an allergy specialist if you suspect you have an insect allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;• If you are allergic, develop a treatment plan and an emergency plan with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s bad news for the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/insect-allergy"&gt;3 percent of adults and 1 percent of children&lt;/a&gt; who have insect allergies. Stinging insect venom in particular is notorious for causing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anaphylaxis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351468"&gt;anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, a life-threatening allergic reaction where blood pressure plummets and airways swell, making it difficult to breathe. And most people don’t know that they’re allergic until they’ve been bitten or stung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Golden explained that there are three broad categories of insects that concern allergy specialists: bees, wasps, and ants. People who have insect allergies are not necessarily allergic to all of them, and even within these groups, someone can react to one variety but not another. There are treatments such as immunotherapy that can protect an allergy sufferer from insect sting complications, but they often provide relief from the bite of just a specific kind of insect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That was evident in Europe in recent years with the arrival of the invasive &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-46029832"&gt;Asian hornet&lt;/a&gt;. “They were reporting that even people who were known to be allergic to yellow jackets and hornets were getting the allergy shots — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8734599/"&gt;venom immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; — to protect them and they were stung by yellow jackets and hornets and they were fine,” Golden said. “But when they got stung by this Asian hornet, they had anaphylaxis all over again. It’s another allergy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/fire-ant-allergy"&gt;fire ants&lt;/a&gt; are also a major concern for allergy sufferers. This is an aggressive, hardy invasive species that took root in the warm climate of the southern and southeastern US, but is gradually moving northward. Their range now reaches &lt;a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/news/climate_change/how-climate-change-is-fueling-virginia-s-fire-ant-invasion/article_21bb5462-6abb-11ea-8abf-1b6d11e8354b.html"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, and they sporadically pop up in &lt;a href="https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/wildlife/insects/html/invasive.html"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Strictly speaking, ticks are not insects, but they are also moving further north as the climate warms. The spread of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/climate-change-fueling-increase-of-lone-star-tick-sightings-in-minnesota/"&gt;lone star tick&lt;/a&gt; is particularly concerning because it can trigger a dangerous allergy condition known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alpha-gal-syndrome/about/index.html"&gt;alpha-gal syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. When the tick bites a host, it transmits a sugar that makes victims &lt;a href="http://v"&gt;react to red meat&lt;/a&gt; like beef, pork, and lamb, as well as products made from mammals. Climate change is also helping spread the ticks that carry &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1307799"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="alaska-is-a-window-into-the-future-of-seasonal-allergies" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Alaska is a window into the future of seasonal allergies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of these factors are converging in America’s largest state, which is warming up to &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/alaska-and-changing-climate"&gt;three times faster than the global average&lt;/a&gt;. And since the climate there is starting from such a cold baseline, many residents are encountering allergy triggers for the first time the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We did a study that showed the further north you went, the higher the prevalence of people seeking health care, urgent care for stinging events,” said Jeffrey Demain, an allergist in Anchorage, Alaska, and clinical professor at the University of Washington. “With milder winters, you have more survival of the hibernaculum, so the queens, they come out in the spring, and they’re already impregnated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Alaska is also getting walloped hard by pollen and mold. “Birch pollen levels can become incredibly high here,” Demain said. “In fact, we oftentimes are the highest in the world. We kind of trade off between Finland, Sweden, and Alaska as far as who has the highest levels.” Sensitivity to pollen can also trigger reactions to certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts, a phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/food/pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/"&gt;pollen food allergy syndrome&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/oral-allergy-syndrome-(oas)"&gt;oral allergy syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. And as warmer air moves in, there’s a growing shift from snow to rain, as well as an &lt;a href="https://www.uaf.edu/news/alaskas-changing-environment-new-report.php"&gt;increase in intense rain events&lt;/a&gt;. More rain means more humidity, which means more mold, which in turn causes major problems for buildings in Alaska built to insulate against the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are other environmental threats mixed into all this as well. Alaska has seen an &lt;a href="https://www.frames.gov/afsc/ACWE"&gt;increase in large wildfires&lt;/a&gt; in recent years and is &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/climate-change-and-wildfire-alaska"&gt;projected to burn more&lt;/a&gt; as average temperatures rise. These fires send huge clouds of smoke and ash into Alaska’s cities, towns, and villages. “Even though that might not be in your immediate area, it causes a tremendous amount of pollution, and the particulates in the air can travel long, long distances,” Demain said. The degraded air quality can irritate airways and &lt;a href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/wildfire-smoke-and-your-health/"&gt;make people more susceptible to allergens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It shows that allergies don’t exist in a vacuum and that climate change can create health problems that intersect and exacerbate each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Looking at allergies alone doesn’t tell the whole story about the magnitude of the threat. It also shows that it’s essential to slow the underlying changes to the climate by reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in order to tamp down on the dangers of future allergies and related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPdkNVM001MlNVaHgxQXZiMWFlOXNFSkZGejJEVjUtWHlvdlY5MHNxUXlISGIyY1I0TmdmeEl3b3hkbUV3Nlh1anRaTVhmZU8zdkZ1VmhzX0NJbi1lSlR0LXExd1pLR0E4SHE0SVJXNER0NDBkX1pSdXFEdEs1NlBWSV9aMDhBdw</guid></item><item><title>Measles outbreak now totals over 600 cases in three states; El Paso County reports cases - Dallas News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOeXdXWFZIa1hmYWV0UHlMUVdpT2RUT3A4SE1vV3RHT0tMNl9BLTlrbnpVRmliXzA0X21RVlY3dktYUGtQbHVocDFFZWVKeHBxUHVsbE9aQTU1bVdac00xYkJhU3RHdFVELVVEdmwyWXlOOWh6c1ZKOWloYXBqVHdKMjFxdFRxelJHZUZPbFFNeFJhOUtDWXRoZnJmeHJkOG5SQjZRSlpJTFpMcGk5VmVlUzRBaUxERC1qa3NvMUIyQ1d6QmNWQUFMYXJ2Um1sU2QzcTBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Texas’ &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/04/08/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-to-more-than-500-cases/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/04/08/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-to-more-than-500-cases/"&gt;measles case count&lt;/a&gt; jumped again, new data showed on Friday, with an additional 36 cases reported in the prior three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The state &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;has now reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 541 measles cases in the ongoing outbreak that began in West Texas in January, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The outbreak has spread to an additional county as well.

This has led to a rise in interest around lots of potential treatments, including senolytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senolytics are considered an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/g33623882/top-anti-aging-moisturizer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-aging&lt;/a&gt; medication, and they’re currently used to treat a range of health conditions. And new research suggests senolytics may potentially help slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, which is raising a bunch of questions in the scientific community about how effective they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senolytics come in a wide range of forms, including over-the-counter supplements. But neurologists say this isn’t something you should just start taking on a whim. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD, MS&lt;/a&gt;, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the study, it’s important to go over some quick facts about &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64276106/alzheimers-treatment-drug-anti-amyloid-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; first. When someone has Alzheimer’s disease, they develop protein clumps in the brain, called amyloid-beta plaques. There are two enzymes found near these plaques, called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enzymes can contribute to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease when they attach to the plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/206227/text" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Aging&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; researchers tested six compounds that are known for either their anti-aging or brain-boosting properties on brain tissue samples from people with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that compounds like dasatinib and nintedanib—which are both senolytics—blocked the forms of AChE and BChE that are associated with amyloid-beta plaques. But the compounds didn’t impact normal brain enzymes, which is a challenge some other medications face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, the researchers used computer models to see how the compounds interacted with brain enzymes. The models found that the enzymes actually change shape when they’re near the plaques, which makes it easier for some compounds to target them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are senolytics? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senolytics are compounds that help to clear out damaged cells that build up with age, explains &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senolytics specifically target senescent cells, aka “zombie cells,” which replicating over time and can be removed by the immune system, but otherwise do not die, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/are-senolytic-supplements-right-for-me.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cedars-Sinai.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cedars-Sinai.&lt;/a&gt; Instead, these zombie cells build up in the body and contribute to inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senolytics are used to treat a range of serious conditions, including diabetes, osteoporosis, and skin or rheumatologic diseases, per Cedars-Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I get them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends. “Some of these you need a prescription from a physician like the medications that end in —nib,” Dr. Segil says. “Some of these you can get at a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63902567/b12-dementia-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin store;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin store&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can even find a bunch at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could this be a potential new Alzheimer’s treatment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to point out that senolytics sold in supplement form aren’t tightly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). With that, it’s a little risky to take a supplement that claims to be in this category—what the label says may not actually be what’s in the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, it’s not clear if senolytics may be helpful for Alzheimer’s disease. “Medications to boost the function of the aging brain could be helpful, but such medicines do not fix the underlying problem that leads to loss of brain function,” says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD, MS&lt;/a&gt;, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “Other strategies are more likely to be more satisfying in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segil points out that we’re a long way from recommending that these products be used for Alzheimer’s disease, particularly the prescription drugs. “There are multiple possible adverse drug effects which could occur from taking repurposed chemotherapy or pulmonary fibrosis medications as anti-aging medications rather than their FDA-approved indications,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 16:55:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1MNk5YWFpsNERtSHh2RGlndDlHNUZ1Ym5wX2tqTXJQdjk5NFUtN0xsbV94RU04a2lPVXY1SFRKemZhdmtDYVA0NlJ4UUdnQVB2eW5LSlNQU2gxaUVvLWltSDlOV3lBbzZ6bVJnVElPX19HR3JlbkE</guid></item><item><title>Massive spike in pregnancy-related death in the US — here’s which states fare the worst - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNVklMMm15MFpWd2VZWWlZdlBNYzNaekl6VmM4REJZTFZKT3JES0pTTVF2RHZsNkZXb24zQU9iQVNtazdKNndZc0YyRVlPSXNuQjRnVEtIRGdRdk8ybmhpUkotd0JOSlU0S0VXV0pXcTM0cmZkSy1vQmliTXVITUdpcUNWNmJCMGlEX0gtQ3AyckVkQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;The United States continues to have the highest &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/17/us-maternal-mortality-hits-highest-rates-since-1965-report/"&gt;maternal mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; among wealthy nations — and new research suggests the crisis is deepening. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832320?guestAccessKey=601c54f6-1301-480b-a5cc-38ece562efb7&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=040925" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published this week in JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; found that the rate of these “largely preventable” deaths rose by nearly 28% between 2018 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The concerning rates in the US should be an urgent public health priority,” wrote the study authors, who also identified a disturbing gap between states when it comes to maternal deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The rate of pregnancy-related deaths hit its peak during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;mikumistock – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An alarming rise in maternal deaths&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, using CDC data, focused on health issues during pregnancy and up to one year after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of more than 18 million live births that took place over the four year study period, researchers identified 6,238 pregnancy-related deaths among women ages 15 to 54.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, nearly a third of those deaths happened more than six weeks after childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Late maternal death occurs in what could be a health care delivery gap between &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/new-york-employers-must-now-offer-paid-medical-leave-of-at-least-20-hours-for-prenatal-care-during-pregnancy/"&gt;obstetric care&lt;/a&gt; and transition to primary care,” the study authors noted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crisis in the South &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the Southeast, the news is especially bleak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These states had the highest rate of pregnancy-related deaths nationwide from 2018 to 2022, with Alabama topping the list at 59.7 deaths per 100,000 live births. Mississippi took second place. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Death rates varied more than threefold between states. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, California had the lowest rate in the US. at 18.5 deaths per 100,000, followed by Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, researchers said that if every state matched California’s number, more than 2,679 deaths could have been avoided over the four year stretch.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Young moms hardest hit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that the rate of pregnancy-related deaths rose from 25.3 per 100,000 live births in 2018 to a peak of 44.1 in 2021, coinciding with the height of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/23/pregnant-women-share-what-its-like-to-be-expecting-during-coronavirus-pandemic/"&gt;coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The rate then fell slightly to 32.6 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the increase in deaths occurred across all age groups, women aged 25 to 39 experienced the most significant rise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease — the number one cause of pregnancy-related deaths overall — played a major role in the spike, &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/rose-molina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Rose L. Molina&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study’s authors, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/health/maternal-death-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Common complications of pregnancy include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and infections. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AntonioDiaz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She explained that pregnancy puts extra stress on the heart and can worsen hidden or existing conditions like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/10/health/i-scary-preeclampsia-heres-what-other-moms-should-know/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/health/heart-disease-risk-higher-for-women-who-have-these-unhealthy-lifestyle-habits/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; itself is becoming more common in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We seem as a society to be getting sicker earlier, which is why we’re seeing this in that particular age group,” said Molina, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other leading culprits that fueled the rising death toll include &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/30/pregnant-women-face-cancer-risk-from-chemicals-in-most-household-products/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/16/number-of-pregnant-women-with-depression-rises-sharply/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; issues, substance abuse and alcohol. The study did not include accidents, homicides or other deaths not medically linked to pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The racial and ethnic divide&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In addition to the state-by-state disparities, researchers also identified widening gaps in pregnancy-related deaths among different races and ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Native American and Alaskan Native women faced the highest rates, followed by Black women.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The study authors said this suggests that “these groups may face disparities in access to postnatal care, as well as other socioeconomic and systemic challenges impacting maternal health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

Diet is one of the most common and modifiable (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jasper Senff, lead study author and post-doctoral fellow at the Singh Lab at the Brain Care Labs, said: 'Dementia, stroke, and late-life depression are connected and intertwined, so if you develop one of them, there's a substantial chance you may develop another one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And because they share these overlapping risk factors, preventive efforts could lead to a reduction in the incidence of more than one of these diseases, which provides an opportunity to simultaneously reduce the burden of age-related brain diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review was published earlier this month in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/21/jnnp-2024-334925"&gt;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp;amp; Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers analyzed 37 articles. Of those, 36 were on stroke, 16 were on dementia, and two were on late-life depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then combined the data to identify modiable risk factors, or those that can be altered with behavioral changes, shared by at least two of the three diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 17 risk factors associated with at least two of the diseases were: blood pressure, kidney disease, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, alcohol use, diet, hearing loss, pain, physical activity, purpose in life, sleep, smoking, social engagement, and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, the team found high blood pressure and severe kidney disease had the greatest impact on incidence and burden of stroke, dementia, and late-life depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure damages blood vessels in the brain, limiting blood flow to areas like the brain. This causes brain cells to die, resulting in dementia, particularly vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also a leading cause of stroke due to this blood vessel damage, as blood vessels become more prone to blockages. Elevated blood pressure also weakens the inner lining of the arteries, causing plaque to build up and clots to form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, high blood pressure can cause inflammation in the brain, which is thought to increase the risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidney disease, on the other hand, prevents the body from filtering out harmful toxins, which can damage brain cells and arteries, leading to dementia, stroke and late-life depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidney disease, which is treated with dialysis (pictured here), raises the risk of dementia through toxins building up in the body and damaging blood vessels and brain cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cognitive activities like puzzles and card games had the lowest association with dementia, though experts noted this could be because people with dementia have a more difficult time completing cognitive tasks in general (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity and leisure time cognitive activity, such as completing puzzles, were associated with the lowest risk of brain disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers suggested these associations may be 'symptomatic rather than causal,' as people with brain disorders like dementia may be less capable of exercising or doing puzzles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure, diet and physical activity were the three risk factors shared by all three diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also looked at more 'overlooked' factors like fulfillment in life, hearing quality, and pain sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emerging evidence suggests having a purpose in life can protect against changes in the brain that lead to dementia, such as brain cell death and a buildup of toxic proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high quality of life also reduces the risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hearing loss has also been shown to cause cognitive strain and prevent social interactions, which add stress to the brain and can increase dementia and stroke risk. That lack of interaction may also influence depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic pain has also been shown to lead to depression, as it can be limiting, and it can attack areas of the brain responsible for cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sanjula Singh, senior study author and principal investigator at Brain Care Labs at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-76561fd0-16db-11f0-aaaa-878b77cdf851"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; General Hospital, said: 'Our study identified 17 modifiable risk factors shared between stroke, dementia, and/or late-life &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-764f1af0-16db-11f0-aaaa-878b77cdf851"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing that there are many different steps individuals can take to lower their risks for these age-related brain diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, such as relying only on existing reviews, meaning other risk factors may have been missed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

CWD was reported in Putnam, Marshall, Adams, and Peoria counties, expanding the geographic presence of the disease in free-ranging deer populations in northern Illinois, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams County is the first documented case recorded outside of the leading edge of the CWD endemic region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD is an always-fatal neurological disease that affects the long-term health of white-tailed deer in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD was first documented in Illinois in 2002 near Roscoe. It has since been detected in 25 counties across northern Illinois and now as far south as Adams County in west-central Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early February 2025, CWD was detected and confirmed through diagnostic testing in Putnam, Marshall, and Adams counties from routine surveillance of hunter-harvested deer. Peoria County was confirmed in a 2-year-old deer exhibiting clinical signs consistent with CWD infection using the same diagnostic testing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples from Adams County underwent genetic testing to ensure genetic matches between submitted tissue samples and source deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affected Illinois counties now include Adams, Boone, Bureau, Carroll, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Ford, Grundy, Jo Daviess, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, LaSalle, Lee, Livingston, Marshall, McHenry, Ogle, Peoria, Putnam, Stephenson, Will, and Winnebago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Illinois is a national leader in managing and slowing the spread of CWD, and over the past two decades IDNR’s program has served as a model for other states,” said IDNR Director Natalie Phelps Finnie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and the &lt;a href="https://dnr.illinois.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and Prevention have not linked CWD to human transmission. However, they recommend against eating meat from CWD-positive deer. Hunters are encouraged to have their deer tested and avoid consuming brain, spinal cord, eyes, and other tissues known to harbor the CWD agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copyright 2025 WAND TV.

surgeon Dr Karan Raj the 'reverse cowgirl position' — when the woman is on top and faces away from her partner — presents the biggest risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the penis doesn't contain any bones, the internal connective tissue which fills with blood during an erection can fracture when the appendage is subject to sharp, blunt force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Such an event is usually accompanied by a distinct cracking, popping or snapping sound and afterwards resembles an 'aubergine' turning purple and swollen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-edb5d310-16c5-11f0-8159-25e6c44b51f6" class=""&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; clip shared with his 5.3million followers Dr Raj&lt;span&gt; said: 'If there is any erratic thrusting or if the movements of the two parties are not in sync, the male [penis] could slip out and be crushed by the female pubic bone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You have been warned over active sex can lead to your penis looking like an enlarged aubergine.'     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest NHS data shows 162 men had to have an operation to save their manhood in 2023-24 after suffering a 'fracture of the penis'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Medics have warned one sex position could be responsible for up to half of all penile fractures, an eye-watering injury that can leave men in agony&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of those being rushed to hospital was 44, though the oldest patients were in their late 70s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2015 &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/768158"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;by researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/brazil/index.html" id="mol-c9fea290-16e7-11f0-9bbc-e71d829dfe81" class=""&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like millions of Americans, I am dyslexic. You would probably never know, unless you happen to be sitting in the passenger seat of my car and find yourself yelling &lt;em&gt;“I said left!”&lt;/em&gt; as I oddly turn right. Then, if you ask me why I turned the wrong way, you will be unable to comprehend that I just can’t remember which side is my right and which is my left. It is simply impossible for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this makes no sense. After all, I have no problem telling the difference between other things. I know up from down. I know black from white. I know forks from spoons. And yet, I do not know left from right. My brain is not wired that way. This is &lt;a href="https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/adults/living-with-a-dyslexic-partner"&gt;true for many dyslexics&lt;/a&gt;, and I suspect multimodal large language models (MLLMs) may be dyslexic too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I describe a recent study that made me question whether MLLMs are dyslexic, let me tell you what it’s like to have the form of dyslexia that I do, and describe what I believe is happening inside my brain. I will also explain why being dyslexic, which makes life difficult for millions of students around the world, can also be a cognitive gift that fosters creativity and innovation.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-living-with-dyslexia"&gt;Living with dyslexia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1528&amp;amp;context=calpoly_magazine"&gt;a kid with dyslexia,&lt;/a&gt; school was very hard for me. This is because many of the fundamentals that students need to learn were created by people who process spatial information differently than I do. For example, we humans created two lowercase letters in the English alphabet — “b” and “d” — that are only different because one points left and one points right. For decades, I could not tell the difference. This is a very &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6005-dyslexia"&gt;common problem&lt;/a&gt; among dyslexics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many of our math rules use algebraic steps that depend on left-right directionality. The same is true &lt;a href="https://knowledgewords.com/images/an-online-survey-research-regarding-awareness-of-dyscalculia-among-educators-in-sandakan-district-sabah.pdf"&gt;for telling time&lt;/a&gt; on traditional clock faces — it only makes sense if you know the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise. Calendars are hard, too, because the spatial layout depends on the left-right directionality. As a result, &lt;a href="https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/dyscalculia/how-can-i-identify-dyscalculia/how-does-dyslexia-affect-maths-learning"&gt;following math rules&lt;/a&gt; and reading clock faces or &lt;a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/f2c239cd61481a2230331b15750cde28/1"&gt;calendars&lt;/a&gt; are common challenges for many dyslexic kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These challenges don’t end in elementary school. I still remember getting a problem wrong in a physics class during my freshman year at Stanford. There is a simple convention in physics called the “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule"&gt;right-hand rule&lt;/a&gt;” for determining how vectors point. Unfortunately, when I took the test, I used my left hand. That is dyslexia. It has nothing to do with focus or intelligence — your brain just works differently from the people who created the cultural conventions we use in symbolic languages, mathematics, and many branches of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how is a dyslexic brain different? I can only speak for myself, but having spent years thinking about the odd mix of strengths and weaknesses that come from how I process spatial information, I am pretty sure I know what’s going on. It all relates to the “mind’s eye.” By this, I mean the way I visualize things inside my mind and store spatial elements in memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/001002857890004X"&gt;their mind’s eye&lt;/a&gt; is oriented behind the bridge of their nose, looking &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2933036"&gt;out into the world&lt;/a&gt;, unless they make a concerted effort to diverge from that perspective. This makes sense because it’s how our brain receives visual content (i.e., from the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2933036/#R30"&gt;first-person perspective&lt;/a&gt;). But when I recall things in my mind (objects, environments, images, or text), I don’t visualize them from a fixed first-person perspective. I think about them from all directions at once, more as a vague &lt;em&gt;cloud of perspectives&lt;/em&gt; than a single, grounded orientation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is, if your brain stores a “b” from all perspectives at once, it becomes an identical symbol to a “d.” It’s not that I confuse these two symbols. It’s that they are the same symbol, the only difference being whether you are visualizing each from the front or behind. The same is true of clock faces. How can you remember the difference between clockwise and counterclockwise if you simultaneously imagine the object from many directions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings me back to &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/predicting-the-digital-superpowers-we-could-have-by-2030/"&gt;multimodal large language models&lt;/a&gt; that process and interpret images and videos. These models are remarkable. They can match or exceed human performance on countless tasks, for example, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07814"&gt;diagnosing cancers&lt;/a&gt; from visual slides better than any human. And yet, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05092"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; found a surprising result: All major MLLMs currently struggle to tell time on analog clocks. According to the study, GPT-4o was only able to correctly read clock faces 8% of the time. Claude-3-5-sonnet was worse at 6%. Gemini 2.0 was the best, but still at only 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are surprisingly low, especially when you consider that these AI models can perform so well in other contexts. In addition, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05092"&gt;the same study&lt;/a&gt; found that MLLMs also struggle when asked to interpret calendars. This is surprisingly similar to dyslexia in humans, not just in the simple artifacts that cause problems (clocks and calendars), but in the confounding mix of strengths and weaknesses that enables a person like me to earn a PhD and work successfully as a computer scientist and engineer, and yet still fail the “turn left here” test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I move on, I had to test this for myself rather than rely on the academic paper cited above. So, I fired up two popular LLMs and asked them to tell me the number of seconds represented by the red hand on the following clock:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-9.19.15%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="Analog clock showing the time as 1:22, with a white face, black numbers, and hands, with a red second hand." class="wp-image-567043" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the two responses that I got back: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-9.19.39%E2%80%AFAM.png" alt="Two explanations about reading a clock's second hand at the 2nd tick mark past the number 2. The first is marked &amp;quot;Gemini Advanced,&amp;quot; and the second, &amp;quot;ChatGPT 4.0." class="wp-image-567044" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The correct answer is just under 9 seconds, but both LLMs incorrectly reported the number (11 seconds for Gemini and 12 seconds for ChatGPT). This is a surprising error, especially since both LLMs approached the problem correctly by looking at the distance from the “2” on the dial.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m pretty sure the LLM can “see” which side of the “2” the second hand is pointing at. So why did both LLMs make this mistake, which happens to be the same type of mistake that I would have made as a kid? Well, if you mix up clockwise and counterclockwise, you might say that it’s “a little &lt;em&gt;past&lt;/em&gt; the two” if you imagine the hand moving in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this error confounding is how well LLMs perform in other visual tasks. In 2023, I was involved in a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00728"&gt;spatial estimation study&lt;/a&gt; where we asked 240 people to estimate the number of gumballs in a jar from a photograph. The average person made a 55% error. We also asked ChatGPT 4, and it was significantly more accurate, estimating with a 42% error. Clearly, LLMs can outperform humans on complex visuospatial tasks, and yet, the average first-grader is likely better at reading clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-this-teach-us-about-current-ai-systems"&gt;What does this teach us about current AI systems? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, it suggests LLMs store and process spatial information so differently than humans, they sometimes struggle with cultural conventions that assume the viewer maintains a particular perspective. When you ask an AI to &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/new-ai-tool-can-diagnose-cancer-guide-treatment-predict-patient-survival/"&gt;interpret a tissue sample&lt;/a&gt; and assess if it’s cancerous, the accuracy is not impacted by orientation. But when you ask it to read a clock face, it has to be conceptualized from a specific direction, or the system will make errors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, such errors are considered a “learning disability,” and for millions of dyslexics, it creates daily challenges, especially for kids. That said, the ability to conceptualize the world from unconventional perspectives is also a cognitive gift. It may be one of the reasons why dyslexic people are often highly creative and innovative. In fact, &lt;a href="https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.10520/EJC31680"&gt;research studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that kids with dyslexia score significantly higher on &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dys.1677"&gt;creativity tests&lt;/a&gt; than the general public. In addition, many adult dyslexics credit their “disability” for their success in various fields. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am certain my career was &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373978123_Dyslexia_and_Mixed_Reality_Invention"&gt;transformed by dyslexia&lt;/a&gt;. In college, it gave me a deep fascination for how people process spatial information and inspired me to earn a PhD focused on enhancing human perception by adding virtual content to the real world. &lt;span&gt;This led me to the Human Sensory Feedback Group at &lt;a href="https://www.afrl.af.mil/" target="_blank"&gt;Air Force Research Laboratory,&lt;/a&gt; where I developed the first &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/history-of-augmented-reality" target="_blank"&gt;mixed reality system,&lt;/a&gt; and I’ve been working in the fields of VR, AR, and AI ever since.&lt;/span&gt; I’ve heard many similar stories from dyslexics who leverage their unique perspectives to innovate in wildly different fields, from artists and filmmakers to scientists, writers, and even many athletes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As AI systems evolve, I suspect we will learn even more about the benefits and hindrances of perceiving the world in radically different ways. After all, we don’t know how smart AI systems will ultimately become, but we do know they do not learn, think, visualize, or reason in the same ways that our brains do — not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

But there are also other hidden signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com spoke to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.havingbabies.com/physicians/natalia-llarena-md/"&gt;Dr. Natalia Llarena&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified OBGYN and reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist, about what perimenopause actually looks like and why it should be discussed more openly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perimenopause usually happens one to three years before menopause, which marks the end of a woman's reproductive years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It varies from person to person but can last for a few months up to several years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Llarena said that during perimenopause, many women experience a symptom called menopause flooding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Most women grow up hearing about menopause like it's a sudden switch that flips in your 50s — but the reality is way more complicated (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Menopause flooding occurs because, at extremes of reproductive age, ovulation may not occur regularly. A lack of ovulation can cause irregular, heavy bleeding,' she explained to FEMAIL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unpredictable bleeding can occur both in the years immediately following the first period and in the years approaching menopause.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of irregular bleeding, Dr. Llarena listed other &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14072963/Im-doctor-common-symptoms-30s-perimenopause.html"&gt;'uncomfortable symptoms' women may experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bleeding that is heavier or lighter than during a typical period, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleep disturbances, and mood changes, including &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-99330840-163d-11f0-be0c-899d83a009a2"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;,' she listed to DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After a person goes through menopause, they are at increased risk for heart disease, osteoporosis and bone fractures, and vaginal dryness/recurrent urinary tract infections.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another OBGYN, who goes by The Vag Doc on TikTok, also shared a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thevagdoc/video/7491391047008832811"&gt;series &lt;/a&gt;of other shocking symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Joint pain - shoulders, ankles, hands, back - why is this happening?' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you think of estrogen as an anti-inflammatory and sort of like a magical body lubricant for our joints and parts of our body, you're gonna start to realize that all those spots feel better when you have good estrogen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DailyMail.com spoke to an OBGYN about what perimenopause actually looks like and why it deserves way more airtime (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When they start to go down, you feel creakier in those spots.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said a common phrase regarding perimenopause joint pain is 'frozen shoulder.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second unexpected symptom she included was tinnitus and itching ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Do we totally understand it? No, but the itching in the ear, again, probably because estrogen has something to do with lubricating the tissue so it's getting drier, it's getting flakier, and it's getting itchier,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her third symptom was equally as surprising - burning of the mouth and tongue as well as dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nerve development sort of changes with the loss of estrogen. The dryness is super common, again, because estrogen lubricates our gums and our inner mouth. So you can start to get all these weird sensations in your mouth,' she detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The content creator also said some women can have electric shock sensations during perimenopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Little phantom zaps and shocks throughout your body,' she revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People will tell me they get certain really sensitive areas where nothing's going on, it just feels like something is an electric shock to that area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In studies, it shows that it is more pronounced when the estrogen levels are going down which we can tell because the periods are getting more irregular.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a woman is in her later productive years, around her late 30s and early 40s, she might experience noticeable changes in her menstrual cycles such as a different flow and a shorter cycle.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Llarena continued: 'Early in the menopausal transition, ovulation becomes less regular, cycles may vary by seven days or more, and then women may begin to notice longer stretches between periods (sometimes 60 days or longer). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is often in this early menopausal transition when some women experience menopause flooding.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The OBGYN explained what happens during a period and how our body changes once we start menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have. They peak at 20 weeks of gestation and decline gradually until menopause,' she told FEMAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At 20 weeks of gestation, we have six to seven million eggs, and at the time of menopause, there are fewer than 1,000 eggs remaining. Every month, the brain sends hormonal signals (primarily a hormone called FSH) to the ovaries to stimulate an egg to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In response, the growing follicle produces estrogen and, after ovulation, produces progesterone. This is the hormonal pattern that produces regular periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The estrogen, along with other hormonal signals from the ovaries (a hormone called inhibin), goes back to the brain and tells it that it no longer needs to produce so much FSH because it has responded appropriately to the signal by making estrogen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'In menopause, there are no longer eggs available to grow, and so the ovary no longer makes estrogen in response to the brain's signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In response to the lack of estrogen from the ovaries, the brain continues to produce high levels of FSH. Because the ovaries are no longer making estrogen, estrogen levels are low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is the typical hormonal pattern we see in menopause: high FSH and low estrogen.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Llarena Falso said that low estrogen is 'responsible for many of the symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For instance, estrogen is thought to play a role in regulating temperature stability in the body,' she expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Without it, women become more sensitive to small changes in temperature (this is what scientists call a 'narrowed thermoregulatory zone'), which is one of the reasons women experience hot flashes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 15:51:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOMUd5OUZLY2cxcUNWYXY2SUVqMnFENHVqWTM5Z0ZQTXo5aXkzRTVMeV9CbGx1bnlVVkd2aWstaTBTQWdvbnZqaVNJWE1EbnViNTNCSk1Kcy01ZTZiUVJxUG1aM0N5cU5oLXhMbWFpYkh5T1JXMlJwOGZzanNhTEdNcmtQTjZGNDBPQUJya0tGYnhmcU9CSGctSnVnaXBaRjhsTkHSAacBQVVfeXFMT21TVFlPY3dCcXJMU1RIZVRmb0xkU3VtNUdBYVpNNmJpRS1oWW43TUZ5TTNMUkhFcS1pR3JOcVRpVzRGU18yaG42UW55ZjdrVWtjd0FrT3UtRktKdTdKN01Na1NvUUhxbG5lUUNuNDZKSUxOQ3B1b1FfN0NTMm1Jd3U1VDR4OVZSSThmUlIzdW95dzktZy1zTFZ4ZUpzbG5FMVhDcDZRZ0k</guid></item><item><title>Republican Has Unbelievably Racist Theory for Measles Outbreak - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOVF9VOFJBc0lIY0RRaWNZVUU3ZlM2Q2JuMDJmVTJpdEFMVzd6S2VtTWstNk1pTk1IM09odDdxM1VOUGxiUS16Y1N5cGo5bGs5ZGd6N015WGdoZE8zNC0yX1hrZ0xvbGJSMERBejdjY3c0T0EwN2FXSkE0SDFoOXFGTjRSbVdGTWJPcUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A Republican lawmaker has a new wildly racist explanation for the deadly measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;During a CNN town hall Thursday, Representative Ryan Mackenzie presented his own theory about the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than 600;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more than 600&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; confirmed cases of measles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Many of these instances that are coming into our country are from illegal immigrants who have crossed the border with no checks, no actual health records, and they are bringing these diseases into our country. There is a reason why measles have started to spread in our country after decades of being almost eradicated,” the Pennsylvania Republican said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last month, Dr. Jennifer Shuford, who oversees the Texas Department of State Health Services, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/03/texas-measles-house-public-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lawmakers that she had no data pinpointing the origin of the outbreak.
