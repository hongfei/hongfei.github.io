    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosf9do006t27p3flpg2qpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            George Mycock’s fitness routine had gotten out of hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5q00083b6nph3k7qxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 22-year-old was terrified of putting on body fat but eager to develop more muscle. He tracked his food so thoroughly that he was weighing lettuce leaves. And he was exercising –– way too much, in fact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00093b6npt6etozi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I halved it, I’d still probably be doing the same, if not more, than what anyone else I knew who was going to the gym,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000a3b6n1og35dem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As hard as he worked, he never felt satisfied. On the contrary, he often felt like he just didn’t have the discipline or character to reach his ever-changing body goals. He felt like a loser.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000b3b6nvtblvfxp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then he found himself pulling away from his friends at university and increasingly believing people would be better off without him, he said. He was experiencing suicidal thoughts when a friend dropped by unexpectedly to check on him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000c3b6ndlhixj90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just started crying in front of her … I just told her how awful I felt,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000d3b6nnmjpfi5e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That was the breakthrough moment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000e3b6n3ziiq2ym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the time, I didn’t really know that it was necessarily about my body or about the eating. I just knew that I felt horrendous. I just thought I was pathetic loser. And she convinced me to get help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000f3b6nwaxh6t07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock has never received a formal diagnosis for the condition –– he only knows of one person who has. But seven years later, as a researcher in the field and doctoral student at the University of Worcester in the United Kingdom, he understands his experience as muscle dysmorphia, which is sometimes called “bigorexia.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000g3b6nfx25d202@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Muscle dysmorphia occurs when an individual becomes obsessed with becoming muscular,” said Dr. Jason Nagata, associate professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine. Nagata is lead author of a review on the condition published in The Lancet Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Health Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000h3b6nqa9jul0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The condition is often unrecognized and behaviors that go with it can even be praised, but the condition isn’t just about vanity, Mycock said. It is a mental health condition that can have serious consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000i3b6nomvek5ew@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This type of dysmorphia can include extreme exercise behaviors, concern about being “scrawny” even if a person is objectively muscular, and the use of performance- or appearance-enhancing drugs, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000j3b6nzdd5olmy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is considered part of a family of eating and body image disorders that are often stereotyped as being restricted to thin, White, young women. But they can happen to anyone – and sometimes they go unnoticed because they can resemble behaviors society praises.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000k3b6nkdj13zup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In moderation, exercise is healthy, and the goal is to find activities that feel enjoyable and sustainable over the long term,” Nagata said. “But with muscle dysmorphia, workouts can shift from something positive to something that causes more stress than joy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000l3b6nvcqcmm47@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people, especially young men, find joy and community at the gym when they go to get fit, but some people can take it too far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000m3b6no00oo1pz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead of looking forward to a workout, people with muscle dysmorphia may feel compelled to go because they worry about missing a session. Building muscle may start to get in the way of work, school or their relationships, Nagata said. People with this condition also may withdraw from social events or their usual activities because of concerns over their appearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000n3b6n3hnic70e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When exercise starts to take over your life rather than support it, that’s a warning sign,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000o3b6nnzx7jdmw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dominance of exercise over a person’s life is not without consequence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000p3b6nphqqwif3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Muscle dysmorphia is linked with a higher risk of depression, anxiety, substance use, and sometimes suicide risk, Nagata said. And the performance-enhancing drugs –– like anabolic steroids –– can have health consequences on the brain, such as irritability, aggression and paranoia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000q3b6nht32tgds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overexercise can lead to muscle or joint injuries, as well, he said. Steroid use can also damage the kidneys and liver and increase heart disease risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000r3b6ny6nowulp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is hard to tell when a desire to be muscular tips over into a disorder, because many people get the cultural message that appearance is important for social status and dating opportunities, said Dr. Kyle Ganson, assistant professor in the Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work at the University of Toronto.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000s3b6nsitbxb6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For a lot of young people, they think that their body needs to look a particular way in order to succeed,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000t3b6nxj4qq219@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Boys and young men in particular are at risk for muscle dysmorphia because of the specific societal pressures put on their bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000u3b6n823pglfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most boys and then have generally higher drive for muscularity overall, like they want to go to the gym. They want to be more muscular based on sort of the ideal male body,” Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000v3b6na33gz1s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weightlifting and body building increase the risk, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000w3b6nayach3sk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Competitive athletes are especially vulnerable, and the risk is even higher when training is focused on changing appearance rather than improving performance,” he said. “Those pressures around physique can make certain athletes more susceptible to developing unhealthy or obsessive relationships with their bodies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000x3b6nm5aytseh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mycock’s problem with fitness began when he injured his spine playing rugby at 13 and had to miss a year of school to recover. When he returned, he noticed his peers weren’t treating him the same. People who would talk with him when he was in a smaller, more muscular body suddenly were not speaking with him as much, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000y3b6nqwnfe0ng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But when he started trying to lose weight, he found that he got more praise, to the point where his back surgeon joked about him coming in to teach other patients how to do it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r000z3b6ncz19sznt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But little did he know that I was, at that point, basically starving myself and exercising multiple times a day,” Mycock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00103b6n632nwdeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only was Mycock’s relationship with his body tied up with his identity as an athlete, but ideas of masculinity were at play, too, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00113b6nkdtpsikt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fitness influencers he followed online spread the message that anyone could achieve the ideal masculine body if only they worked hard enough, were disciplined enough and were man enough, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00123b6ngkn7kkoi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the stricter Mycock got with his diet and exercise, the farther the goalpost moved.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00133b6nyr7xszd8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every time I managed to meet the thing that I was aiming at, my brain said, ‘OK, this is now a thing that I can do, therefore it’s not good enough, and I need to do more,’” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00143b6ndkcllpvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It makes sense, because social media use is associated with muscle dissatisfaction and steroid use, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00153b6na3yml769@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Boys’ bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts,” he added in an email. “Boys scroll through an endless feed of hyper-muscular, ultra-lean physiques, often heavily filtered or selected from hundreds of shots, which creates a constant pressure to measure up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00163b6np1ethllp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When Mycock couldn’t reach the always far-off destination of the ultimate, masculine body, the message he received was that he just wasn’t good enough as a person, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00173b6nzt8v02yv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a lot that researchers don’t know about muscle dysmorphia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00183b6n9ncj9z21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data on the prevalence is limited, but two studies in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33722325/#:~:text=A%20study%20of%203%2C618%20Australian%20adolescents%20found,to%20report:%20*%20Severe%20preoccupation%20with%20muscularity" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11916914/" target="_blank"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; estimate that 2% to 3% of boys meet the criteria for muscle dysmorphia, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r00193b6ntago5bjq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One problem getting more information on the disorder is that people who have muscle dysmorphia likely have the gym and muscle building embedded in so much of their lives, that they are less likely to disrupt their world by seeking help, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001a3b6n7gbzregy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also difficult to determine the best treatment, because the condition resembles body dysmorphic disorder and eating disorder behaviors. Dietary practices and bulking and cutting, for example, can veer into disordered eating, Ganson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001b3b6nmicjqk1h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/27/health/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-wellness"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; would likely be the first line of defense, he said. But, family-based treatment like those used for adolescents with eating disorders might provide benefit as well, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001c3b6nnr6d0mzk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Either way, with the potential for physical and mental health consequences, people concerned that they may be experiencing muscle dysmorphia should seek professional help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001d3b6n0hf0yxyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A therapist or health care provider may be a good place to start.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001e3b6n5cya7av1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally, the support comes from an interdisciplinary team including mental health, medical and nutrition providers, Nagata said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001f3b6net42mr23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recovery from this condition isn’t linear.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001g3b6n44agtvyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Today, Mycock can eat and exercise in a way that feels healthy and balanced, but body image is still something that takes some thought, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001h3b6nqm69mt7d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are still times that he feels insecure, but his work with a counselor has helped him to not make his feelings about his body the foundation of his whole life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiosgd5r001i3b6np0cagj9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Previously, my life was built on a pillar, and the base of that pillar was the way that my body looked and the way people saw my body, and then everything else, like who I was, was built on top of that,” he said. “So, whenever something happened to that … my whole life fell apart.”

In a word—yikes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But let’s rewind for just a sec.

(The study included 108 participants, both men and women, between the ages of 25 and 75.) What they found was that the molecules didn’t shift in numbers in a linear fashion over time, but in bursts around the ages of 44 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It turns out the mid-40s is a time of dramatic change, as is the early 60s,” &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/08/massive-biomolecular-shifts-occur-in-our-40s-and-60s--stanford-m.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.1.0"&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; study senior author Michael Snyder, PhD, professor of genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine. “And that’s true no matter what class of molecules you look at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Initially, researchers assumed that the mid-40s shift they noticed was due to the changes women in the test group were undergoing during &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/female-health/a45117939/is-testosterone-the-missing-piece-of-the-menopause-puzzle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/female-health/a45117939/is-testosterone-the-missing-piece-of-the-menopause-puzzle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="perimenopause or menopause" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;perimenopause or menopause&lt;/a&gt;. But when they isolated just the men, the same shift was still evident, leading them to theorize that there are other underlying drivers of aging for both men and women that have nothing to do with perimenopause or menopause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Further research will be needed to identify a lot of these whys—in addition to further validating the results. Given the study’s small participant pool and limited timespan (participants were followed for a median period of 1.7 years), a bigger, longer-term study will be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But the initial results were undeniably compelling.

And they don’t call it beauty rest for nothing. Says Marisa Garshick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist: “The nighttime is usually a reparative, restorative time for the skin.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Just how many hours a night should you be logging?

Cut back on alcohol.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="17" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;One habit that could be disrupting your time in Dreamland? That nightly glass of Chardonnay. “As we age, we don't metabolize alcohol as easily, and it impairs our sleep quality,” says Keri Peterson, MD, an internal medicine physician, who begins discussing alcohol consumption more aggressively with patients in their 40s. “The metabolite of alcohol is a stimulant, so it wakes us up, often around 3 a.m.” (It’s worth noting that the Stanford study also found shifts in alcohol metabolism around ages 40 and 60.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If possible, Dr. Peterson recommends cutting alcohol out entirely. “Even with one glass, you're going to have disrupted sleep,” she says.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="establish-a-strength-training-routine-if-you-havent-already" data-node-id="20" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;3. Establish a strength-training routine (if you haven’t already).&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="21" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Women start losing muscle mass as early as their 30s. In fact, we lose about &lt;a href="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://womenshealth.gov/sarcopenia" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="3 to 5 percent per decade" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="22.1.0"&gt;3 to 5 percent per decade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But you can preserve the muscle mass you have—or even build more!—by lifting, even just a few days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“It doesn't have to be five days a week like a bodybuilder in a gym,” says Kristen McParland, a NASM-certified personal trainer. “There's tons of research that shows just two days a week of full-body strength training can give you a laundry list of positive side effects to your immune system, your muscle mass, your bone density, your mood, your sleep, and your heart health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Of course, you can’t lift the same 3-lb. dumbbell week after week in the hopes of seeing gains. “In order to see change in a muscular bone joint, you need to challenge the muscle,” McParland says. You can do this by incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60720121/progressive-overload-training/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a60720121/progressive-overload-training/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="progressive overload" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into your routine, which essentially means upping the weight and/or reps every few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The Bottom line, says McParland: “If a client is in [the gym strength training] twice a week, they're lifting from 30 to 60 minutes full-body, and they're intentionally challenging their muscle groups—that's the most important part.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-your-muscles-with-protein" data-node-id="27" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;4. Support your muscles with protein.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="28" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Show of hands: Who’s heard the saying “muscles are built in the kitchen“? While it’s a bit of a generalization, there’s certainly a nugget of truth to it, says McParland. “It doesn't matter how hard you work in the gym if you don't have an adequate protein and carbohydrate intake to help build the muscle.” While the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60528607/how-much-protein-is-too-much/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60528607/how-much-protein-is-too-much/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein has long been .36 grams per pound of body weight" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="29.1.0"&gt;recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein has long been .36 grams per pound of body weight&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, McParland recommends aiming for .8 to 1 gram per pound of body weight to support muscle-building goals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-forget-the-cardio" data-node-id="30" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;5.

(The Stanford study notes that aging has been associated with cardiovascular disease.) The &lt;a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans" data-node-id="32.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="32.1.0"&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recommends a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate aerobic activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But what exactly constitutes “moderate aerobic activity”? “I like to tell my clients that you should start to feel your heart rate go up, maybe you're a little out of breath, but you could still keep up with a brief conversation,” McParland says. That could take the form of incline walking, biking, hiking, or a light jog (emphasis on the light, McParland adds). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="protect-your-skin-with-spf" data-node-id="35" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;6. Protect your skin with SPF.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="36" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you aren’t already wearing a daily sunscreen on your face, neck, chest, and hands, now is the time to start, says Dr. Garshick. That’s because UV rays cause &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html#:~:text=UVA%20rays%20are%20mainly%20linked,to%20cause%20most%20skin%20cancers." data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/sun-and-uv/uv-radiation.html#:~:text=UVA%20rays%20are%20mainly%20linked,to%20cause%20most%20skin%20cancers." data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="skin cells to age" data-node-id="37.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="37.1.0"&gt;skin cells to age&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and can harm the cells’ DNA. (Plus, there’s the increased risk of skin cancer.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When shopping for a sunscreen, make sure it has an SPF of at least 30 (higher is even better) and that it’s marked as “broad spectrum,” meaning it provides coverage against both UVA and UVB rays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="39" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="as-you-approach-age-60" data-node-id="40" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="40.0"&gt;As You Approach Age 60...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you are already doing all of the above, here are a few more expert-backed action items to consider adding to your list in your later 40s and 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="talk-to-your-doc-about-hormone-replacements" data-node-id="42" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;1.

This causes numerous side effects, including hot flashes, weight gain, sleep disturbances and more. You may be able to stave off some of these symptoms—and prevent some age-related conditions—by taking a hormone replacement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“I do recommend women discuss the pros and cons, whether they're a candidate, and whether they think it's for them with their doctor,” says Dr. Peterson. “If you're doing estrogen and progesterone without testosterone, it's going to help hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, osteoporosis prevention, and just overall sense of wellbeing. If you also do it with testosterone, that will help support muscle building and libido.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="implement-practices-that-help-keep-your-brain-stimulated-and-sharp" data-node-id="46" class="body-h2 css-1q3hln2 emevuu60"&gt;2.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Giving a young kid a smartphone may be a big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;New research conducted by scientists from UC Berkeley and Columbia University found that children 12 years old and younger who received one of these devices were at a higher risk of depression, obesity, and sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The alarming findings, published as a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072941/205716/Smartphone-Ownership-Age-of-Smartphone-Acquisition?" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/em&gt;, were based on an analysis of over 10,000 children who participated in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study between 2018 and 2020, which is purportedly the largest long-term study of brain development and child health in the US. And while they don’t strictly establish causation, the broad correlation they show underscores a larger and ever-growing body of research exploring the deleterious cognitive effects that devices like smartphones and tablets can have adolescents, ranging from their &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/banning-phones-schools-behavior"&gt;impact on their education&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/children-screen-time-developmental-delays"&gt;social skills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“When you give your kid a phone, you need to think of it as something that is significant for the kid’s health — and behave accordingly,” lead author Ran Barzilay, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/well/family/early-smartphone-ownership-study.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In the study, about two-thirds of the participants used a smartphone. The median age they received them at was 11 years old, and their development was compared to a cohort of roughly 3,800 children in the study who never received a smartphone before turning 12.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Not only did the researchers find that children who owned a smartphone by age 12 were at a greater risk of depression, obesity, and poor sleep, but they also showed that the younger a child was when they first received a smartphone, the higher those risks became for obesity and poor sleep in particular. The earlier a kid is hooked on a smartphone, in other words, the worse their physical and mental health outcomes are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Trying to identify the “right” age to give a youth a smartphone, however, may be missing the point. The researchers also found that a group of children who had never owned a smartphone before turning 12, but were then given one, showed a higher risk of poorer mental health and sleep by the time they were 13, compared to another group who stayed phoneless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“We didn’t even look at what the kids did on the phone,” Barzilay &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-smartphones-increased-risk-of-health-problems-study/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one’s own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;That is both a strength and a drawback to the study. It’s likely that it’s not just a quality inherent to the smartphones that are causing problems, but the apps they give access to, like social media sites, whose myriad risks to children are well documented. YouTube, TikTok, and streaming services like Netflix could supply an endless amount of entertainment to keep a child well up past their bedtime, too. Then there’s addictive mobile games designed to both murder your attention span and drain your wallet. At this moment, we’re also plunging headlong into a world of AI chatbots and companions, which &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/lonely-children-ai-chatbots"&gt;many children are turning to act as a close friend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;A lot of questions are unanswered, but these latest findings are echoed by a bevy of other research. A &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/study-younger-kids-smartphones"&gt;2025 study&lt;/a&gt; of over 100,000 children, for example, found that those who received smartphones before the age of 13 experienced more suicidal thoughts, a lower perception of self-worth, and detachment from reality. Similarly, the study also found that every year before 13 that a child received a smartphone was associated with a greater likelihood of poorer mental health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Society is still grappling with how these devices have transformed interpersonal relationships and taken over teenage and preteen attention spans. Many schools are opting to take the safe route by &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/future-society/banning-phones-schools-behavior"&gt;banning smartphones entirely&lt;/a&gt;. In follow-up research, Barzilay hopes to explore more specific features of smartphone usage to determine their link to mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“It’s critical for young people to have time away from their phones to engage in physical activity, which can protect against obesity and enhance mental health over time,” Barzilay said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-in-childhood-to-increased-risk-of-depression-and-obesity-in-youth-302627044.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the work.&lt;/p&gt;

They are anticipating to be open by the winter of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spot, formerly the ELDR Restaurant, also has ties to Biltmore, the release said. It was the site of Biltmore Industries — originally founded in Biltmore Village with support from Edith Vanderbilt — and was purchased in 1917 by Fred Loring Seely, son-in-law of Edwin Grove and the visionary behind the Grove Park Inn, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Wayside owner Mark Harding said he and his wife are looking forward to starting business back up in the restaurant's new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/hurricane-helene-journey-hope-return-biltmore-village-recovery-over-11-months-nearly-one-year-post-storm-tourism-visitors-locals-business-owners-association" target="_blank"&gt;HELENE: A JOURNEY OF HOPE (RETURN TO BILTMORE VILLAGE)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we will forever cherish the memories of our time in Biltmore Village in the iconic old train depot, we are excited to embrace this new chapter as a chance to rebuild, grow, and connect with the community,” he said in the release. “We can’t wait to welcome back our loyal patrons of many years and introduce the Wayside to the North Asheville community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hardings operated Village Wayside in Biltmore Village for 15 years at the historic spot next to the depot, which itself represents a pivotal chapter in Asheville’s development. According to the release, when George Vanderbilt visited the region in 1888, he envisioned both a grand estate and a surrounding village. To bring this vision to life, he hired architect Richard Morris Hunt and landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Their combined efforts shaped not only the Biltmore Estate but also the community that became Biltmore Village. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The train depot opened in 1896 and remained a transportation hub until 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WLOS</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 19:02:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wJBVV95cUxNV0xTMmlyTy13VlNLZXc2RTZReTc5c2FHaDlBcnZqd0xRNXVldU9DQ0tOY3ZoRDltWF91T3I5cG9Dc0FrbVctcEE1NXY1ZVNEYjkxV2p3Qk0xZ0V5eTBoeHk5bEpJbnRITmNMMnhIckxOay04TTRYRDNkVmR6ZTh3YVBNTU54azJMWndVVnliZEVMMEk0aHUwc2pPNnczV1JSTzlGckRIYVlnVTBrNmVWa0t3NVJPVGdhNlZob041M2dnWi1hU2RTemxhdmhxTVBnYlBMa3cxZWJ1MlRKVG0tVmRLX1J4ZzQ0Tk1QVnpHdDM2VlMtNlFoaThtdWRnOWViOXlrdW9VUElpTHdnaEpPYWtqemFsaWE3bW5ZSDVqRlUySFZVcU9Cd3JLN0RDS3RjalpsRWROZ3pEa0hfX2VmWjVOVkRRdmQ1OW9TXzVkb081bm9aRkRN</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的疫苗顾问计划对儿童时间表进行最大的改变-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/02/acip-hepatitis-b-childhood-immunization-schedule/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DVZUM7HBPRCRXOG4SRIOIIZFGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Federal vaccine advisers selected by Health Secretary Robert F.

&lt;p&gt;CDC data has found that boys and young men, aged 12 to 24, have a heightened risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) after COVID-19 vaccination. However, the cases are rare, relatively mild, and almost always resolve, according to CDC data. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-06-25-26/04-Meyer-COVID-508.pdf"&gt;In a COVID-19 safety data presentation in June&lt;/a&gt;, CDC staff scientists reported that its vast vaccine safety monitoring systems indicated that in males 12–24, there are 27 myocarditis cases per million doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered (roughly one case in 37,000 doses). In cases identified during 2021, 83 percent recovered within three months, with more than 90 percent recovering within the year. The monitoring data found no instances of cardiac transplant or death from COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anti-vaccine activists have seized on this minor risk from vaccination, health experts note that the risk of myocarditis and other inflammatory conditions from a COVID-19 infection is significantly greater than the risk from vaccination. Exact estimates vary, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm"&gt;one CDC study in 2021&lt;/a&gt; found that people with COVID-19 infections had a 16-fold higher risk of myocarditis than people without the infection. Specifically, the study estimated that there were 150 myocarditis cases among 100,000 COVID-19-infected patients versus just nine myocarditis cases among 100,000 people without COVID-19 infections and who were also unvaccinated. Similar to what’s seen with vaccination, the study found that young males were most at risk of myocarditis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s allies attack on COVID-19 shots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and his allies, like Milhoan, have consistently inflated the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 vaccination, with some claiming without evidence that they have caused sudden cardiac arrest and deaths in young males, though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7314a5.htm"&gt;studies have found no such link&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, Milhoan and fellow ACIP member and conspiracy theorist Robert Malone were featured in &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/SEVCD"&gt;a viral social media post&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that 50 percent of college athletes in the Big Ten athletic conference had myocarditis linked to COVID-19 vaccines, which could lead to deaths if they played. But the two were referencing a JAMA Cardiology study that examined subclinical myocarditis in Big Ten athletes &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2780548"&gt;after COVID-19 &lt;em&gt;infection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—not vaccination. In fact, researchers confirmed for &lt;a href="https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.32HC88U"&gt;an AFP fact check&lt;/a&gt; that none of the athletes in the study were vaccinated. And the rate of subclinical myocarditis in the group was 2.3 percent, not 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

Even during the act (usually I spend anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes down there), I often have a reaction where I build up sinus pressure and can get a runny nose. It’s difficult to diagnose sinus infections, and the symptoms usually pass after two to three days, but this last one lasted over a week. Have you ever heard of anything like getting a head cold/flu/sinus infection from cunnilingus?&lt;/p&gt;

However, you want to track this (a list, a calendar app, or a paper planner) is fine, but you need to be meticulous, and you should log everything to the exact day and keep logging throughout the entire duration. Do this daily. Your memory, like everyone’s, is fallible, and if you’re trying to remember a week’s worth of stuff, you’re going to make mistakes. You might also see whether your wife is open to trying a dental dam, mostly to figure out whether that prevents the sinus symptoms, but there’s also a chance that she really enjoys the sensation and it works for her in a way that raw oral doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard-boiled eggs and cottage cheese are equally nutritious, protein-packed snacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’re also rich in vitamins and minerals, so there’s no need to choose one.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians suggest pairing them with fruits or veggies for fiber and extra vitamins and minerals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One is portable. One enjoyed a comeback fueled by TikTok. And they’re both packed with protein. We’re talking about hard-boiled eggs and cottage cheese. But only one can take the crown. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; OK, not really. When we asked registered dietitians which one is the healthier snack, they agreed that both can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fit into a healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt;. The choice really comes down to your personal preferences and your unique health needs. So, it’s not necessary to stick to just one. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s the nutrition scoop on why they’re both great-for-you snacks. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-benefits-of-hard-boiled-eggs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Benefits of Hard-Boiled Eggs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Contain High-Quality Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs are an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excellent source of amino acids&lt;/a&gt;, the building blocks of protein. One large hard-boiled egg provides 6 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s not just about the amount of protein. Eggs boast one of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7821729/myths-about-protein-fact-or-fiction/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;highest-quality forms of protein&lt;/a&gt;, which is readily available to your body to use for things like muscle-building and repair.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because eggs’ protein also promotes satiety, they may help with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056824/16-weight-loss-tips-and-tricks-that-actually-work-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt;. If weight loss is a goal, a hard-boiled egg can be a good snack, especially when paired with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://kimberlygomer.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kimberly Gomer, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Provide Hard-to-Get Nutrients  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While egg whites are mostly protein, the yolks are the true nutritional gold mines. In addition to protein, the yolks contain nutrients many of us don’t get enough of, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamins D and E&lt;/a&gt;. Egg yolks are also one of the best sources of choline, which supports brain and nerve function, says &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/mia-syn?utm_source=google" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mia Syn, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just one large egg provides 27% of the Daily Value for this underconsumed nutrient. Eggs also give you vitamin A, iodine and folate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Have Eye-Healthy Antioxidants &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You know how the yolk is yellow? That’s a sign of its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-protect-your-vision-8773401" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant pigments, lutein and zeaxanthin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Syn points out that these carotenoids may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-eye-health-according-to-a-dietitian-8773671" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;support eye health&lt;/a&gt;, as they accumulate in the retina, protecting the macula (the part of the eye responsible for sharp vision).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research has found that people who ate two to four eggs weekly were 49% less likely to develop late-stage age-related macular degeneration (AMD) compared to those who ate one egg or less per week over the span of 15 years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Also Contains High-Quality Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With roughly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/snack-recipes-10-grams-of-protein-11852613" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;12 grams of protein per half-cup&lt;/a&gt;, cottage cheese is an excellent source of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One particular protein you’ll find in cottage cheese is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-choose-the-best-cottage-cheese-11847051" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;casein protein&lt;/a&gt;, says Gomer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Casein digests slowly, and it can really help you feel full,” she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t mean it’s better than eggs, though. In one older study that pitted cottage cheese versus eggs, researchers concluded that both foods had equal satiating power.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Also Rich in Vitamins and Minerals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although cottage cheese contains a different set of vitamins and minerals than eggs, it still offers an impressive menu of micronutrients. “In addition to protein, it also provides key nutrients, including calcium and phosphorus, which are important for bone health, as well as B vitamins, which help convert the food we eat into energy,” says Syn.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Contain Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotics are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;live bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that promote the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;health of your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some types of cottage cheese contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16530/can-probiotics-really-help-your-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;added probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. To know for sure, check the ingredient list for live cultures, like &lt;em&gt;L. acidophilus&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium lactis&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-do-you-need-to-choose"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Do You Need to Choose? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nope. “Both are nutritious snack options on their own, but to make them more balanced, you can pair them with other foods,” says Syn. For example, a hard-boiled egg has protein and fat, so add a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-to-eat-every-week-11787950" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, like whole-grain toast or a piece of fruit, she recommends. For cottage cheese, top it with fruit like fresh berries. For an additional &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7993588/ways-to-add-healthy-fat-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;source of healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, add some nuts or seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding both to your weekly rotation is a great way to rack up a variety of nutrients. Plus, they’re super-convenient. Grocery and convenience stores may sell small cups of cottage cheese or packages of hard-boiled eggs. So, each can be a nice grab-and-go protein source when you’re out and about. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is one caveat: Your individual health concerns. If you are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290640/lactose-intolerance-symptoms-causes-what-to-eat-and-more/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sensitive to dairy&lt;/a&gt;, you may experience &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-reasons-youre-so-gassy-11755428" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bloating or gas&lt;/a&gt; after eating dairy foods like cottage cheese, says Gomer. That’s because cottage cheese contains lactose, which some people are unable to digest fully. (However, it contains less lactose than milk.)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cottage cheese is also typically &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290568/looking-for-low-sodium-foods-watch-out-for-these-sneaky-sources-of-sodium/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high in sodium&lt;/a&gt;, with about 360 milligrams per half-cup. That can be an issue for you if you have high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, there are no-added-sodium versions you can buy with as little as 15 mg of sodium per half-cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What about the cholesterol in eggs? It’s not a reason to avoid them. But if you have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893923/habits-to-break-to-lower-cholesterol/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high LDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; or are genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, your health care provider may recommend limiting egg intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024093/best-low-fat-cheeses/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;saturated fat in full-fat cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; can also raise blood cholesterol levels. So, if you’re on team cottage cheese and have high cholesterol, stick with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/283529/is-cottage-cheese-or-greek-yogurt-a-healthier-high-protein-snack/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both hard-boiled eggs and cottage cheese are nutritious snacks that are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/snacks-more-protein-than-egg-11744826" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;packed with protein, vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt;.

He said: “Omega-3 fatty acids aren’t a wellness fad; they are essential nutrients linked to heart health, brain development, inflammation control and healthy ageing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Adults are recommended to consume 250 mg per day of combined EPA and DHA, with an additional 100–200 mg of DHA advised for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;However, Dr. Abbie Cawood, who was involved in the &lt;a href="/topic/study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; and is the science director at Holland &amp;amp; Barrett and a visiting research fellow at the University of Southampton, said in a statement: “Achieving recommended intakes from diet alone can be challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;What Is Omega-3?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The British Heart Foundation, a UK-based charity that funds cardiovascular research, explains that the body needs omega-3s to function but can’t make them itself, so they must come from food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The omega-3s most important for health are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="List_wp-block-list__nTkVj"&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA):&lt;/strong&gt; found in certain nuts and seeds and oils made from them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)&lt;/strong&gt;: found in mainly in oily fish but also white fish and seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)&lt;/strong&gt;:  mainly in oily fish but also white fish and seafood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;ALA is the only omega-3 that’s truly essential because our bodies can not produce it. We can convert a small amount of ALA into EPA and DHA, but not enough to rely on— so it is still useful to eat foods that provide EPA and DHA directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;Why Omega-3 Matters Across the Lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/daily-omega-3-fish-oil-change-behavior-scientists-supplements-1906195"&gt;Omega-3 consumption supports a healthy lifestyle &lt;/a&gt;at every stage of life—from lowering the chance of pre-term birth and aiding visual and cognitive development in infants, to improving cardiovascular health and immune function later on. It is also associated with a reduced risk of depression and cognitive decline, including &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/alzheimers-dementia-omega-3-fatty-acids-women-2115662"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Banerjee, the founder of private healthcare service HarleyDoc, said meeting the guidelines is easier said than done for many due to several factors, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="List_wp-block-list__nTkVj"&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cost-of-living pressures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reduced fish availability in certain regions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ListItem_wp-block-list-item__tMZ_4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cultural dietary patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;He added: “There’s widespread misunderstanding of what constitutes ‘enough’ omega-3. These factors all play a role. Even in countries with abundant seafood, many individuals simply don’t consume oily fish regularly enough to reach recommended intakes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="Heading_blockHeading__6ppY9"&gt;How to Increase Omega-3 Intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Banerjee explained that the most effective approach for those who eat fish involves eating oily varieties once or twice per week. The richest sources are mackerel, salmon, sardines, herring and anchovies—cold-water species naturally high in EPA and DHA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;But not everyone likes fish, can afford it or follows a meat-based diet; therefore, supplementation is often the only viable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Banerjee said: “A good supplement should provide at least 500 mg of combined EPA/DHA per day, be tested for purity and oxidation, and ideally come in triglyceride form for better absorption. For vegetarians and vegans, algae-derived omega-3s offer an effective alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that Newsweek should be covering?

New research shows that simple fertilizers from these peels can make plants taller and healthier than those in untreated soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are one of the world’s top fruit crops, with harvests reaching about 116 million tons in recent years. Because the peel makes up a quarter of each fruit by weight, mountains of skins end up as waste instead of feeding soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-banana-peels-crops-and-soil"&gt;Banana peels, crops, and soil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work behind the new review was led by Nokuthula Khanyile, a researcher at the &lt;a href="https://www.ump.ac.za/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Mpumalanga&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her research focuses on turning agricultural waste, including banana peels, into safer fertilizers that support both crops and soil life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/11/1894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, her team gathered results from 126 studies that tested banana peel based fertilizers on many different crops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across those experiments, plants given peel based treatments often grew taller, produced more leaves, or germinated faster than plants grown in untreated soil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banana peels are packed with macronutrients, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plants-have-genetic-tricks-to-survive-wild-nutrient-swings/"&gt;nutrients plants&lt;/a&gt; need in relatively large amounts. Analyses of their chemistry show high potassium alongside nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium, which are exactly the elements farmers buy in commercial fertilizer blends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now most banana peels still go to landfills, where rotting food adds to greenhouse gas emissions and wastes all of those nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning them into fertilizers instead links a common household habit, eating bananas, with cleaner farming and less pressure to mine or manufacture new nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-kitchen-scrap-to-biofertilizer"&gt;From kitchen scrap to biofertilizer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers use the word biofertilizer, fertilizer made from living or once living materials, for many of these peel based products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some methods are simple, such as sun drying peels, grinding them into a coarse powder, and mixing that directly into the soil before planting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That review found one recipe turning up often, a blend of dried banana peels with dried orange peels used as fertilizer. In the trials it summarized, this fruit peel mix often increased leaf area and root length more than untreated soils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other teams crushed fresh peels into slurry and heated them with simple ingredients, then filtered the liquid to make concentrated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-green-tech-ammonia-fertilizer-production-using-earths-natural-forces/"&gt;fertilizer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That liquid can be diluted with water and poured onto soil, so plants take up the nutrients through their roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some projects go further and ferment banana peels with coffee grounds or other plant wastes. During that time, microbes slowly release nutrients into the liquid, and early tests suggest the resulting fertilizers can speed up leafy vegetable growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-banana-peels-on-crops"&gt;Testing banana peels on crops&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One experiment with pea plants tested banana peels decomposed in soil for different lengths of time. Peels that had broken down for about two months supported the best germination and growth, while longer decomposition made the plants weaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study also tested peels that had decomposed in water instead of soil. Those peels gave the highest germination rate after about six months, but plant height stopped improving as decomposition went on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/seeds-rich-in-protein-and-magnesium-help-grow-muscle-mass-fenugreek/"&gt;fenugreek&lt;/a&gt;, researchers compared dried &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/banana-apocalypse-can-science-save-our-favorite-fruit/"&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt; peel powders with liquid extracts made from the same material. Plants given the liquid extract grew taller and produced more greens over the same period than those given the dry powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In okra experiments, researchers combined banana peel powders with other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/banana-apocalypse-can-science-save-our-favorite-fruit/"&gt;fruit peels&lt;/a&gt; and added them before planting and again later near the stems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That schedule produced richer leaf color, larger leaf area, and heavier pods than soil that only received the usual chemical fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-fertilizers"&gt;Implications for fertilizers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern farming still leans heavily on synthetic NPK fertilizers, which are blends of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium made in factories that depend on fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These products have boosted yields for decades, but overuse lets extra nitrogen wash into water and trigger eutrophication, overgrowth of algae that harms fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One global &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-18773-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that synthetic nitrogen fertilizers produce about 2 percent of total human greenhouse gas emissions. That share is large for a single farm input, so any safe replacement for part of this nitrogen matters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/understanding-impacts-synthetic-nitrogen-air-and-water-quality-using-integrated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;) has linked excess fertilizer nitrogen to smog, fine-particle pollution, and unhealthy levels of nitrate in drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because banana peel based fertilizers release nutrients slowly and rely on recycled waste, they offer a route to cut losses while keeping yields steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crop-lessons-from-banana-peels"&gt;Crop lessons from banana peels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For home gardeners and small farms, the message is straightforward. Banana peels, orange peels, coffee grounds, and similar scraps can be turned into useful fertilizer with simple tools instead of being tossed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also highlights what does not work as well. Banana peel biochar, a charcoal like soil additive made from heated plant waste, often had little effect on plant height at the doses tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the trials reviewed stopped at the seedling or early growth stage. Researchers still need long season field tests that follow crops to harvest and check not just yield, but also nutrient content and shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemistry of banana peels changes with variety, climate, and storage, so future work needs recipes that farmers can trust from season to season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes measuring not only nutrient levels in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-waste-could-be-used-as-sustainable-fertilizer/"&gt;fertilizers&lt;/a&gt;, but also how each blend affects soil structure and root microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If even a fraction of the world’s banana peels were turned into well tested fertilizers, farmers could cut their dependence on costly synthetic products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work on kitchen waste based fertilizers suggests that a cleaner fertilizer future may already be sitting in compost buckets on kitchen counters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/11/1894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agriculture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 16:21:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNVkUyQmRXVDRLUVdzTnItNzJUdUZPQ2Ezb0ducWNISlBubjU0Q050ME9aS3ppY0N6SnQwX1g3aDBNVG5sYWJKOXRzRVhKWFR0TDI4Yk1BbHJjeFpNTEVCeGI4UGZpVXNsNHBhdkM0ajBVcFprNHp6ZUgxaE53T1J4TlBIQnpOUnRRNnprVFpuajZGS0V5aVhVemdFNFIxUDM2WTlTdTBUUmxVbEdB</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，带状疱疹疫苗可能会减缓痴呆症的进展- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/02/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia-progression-study-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioo1bkc001w2cnngi25cluh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;shingles vaccine&lt;/a&gt; not only offers protection against the painful viral infection, but a new study suggests that the two-dose shot also may slow the progression of dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000a3b6nc6g0yzj9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Shingles, caused by the varicella-zoster virus, presents as a painful rash and it’s estimated that about 1 in every 3 people in the United States will develop the illness in their lifetime. But the risk of shingles and serious complications increases with age, which is why in the United States, two doses of the shingles vaccine is recommended for adults 50 and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000b3b6nymgnmm26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While vaccination is estimated to be more than 90% effective at preventing shingles in older adults, recent research has shed light on some other potential benefits too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000c3b6nzalbj2t5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Emerging research suggests that getting the vaccine to protect against shingles may &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/health/shingles-vaccines-dementia-studies"&gt;reduce the risk of developing dementia&lt;/a&gt;. A follow-up study, published Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.11.007" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, adds to that research by suggesting that the vaccine could also have therapeutic properties against dementia, by slowing the progression of the disease, leading to a reduced risk of dying from the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000d3b6n7cfarsjr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We see an effect on your probability of dying from dementia among those who already have dementia,” Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, assistant professor of medicine at &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/pascal-geldsetzer" target="_blank"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt; and senior author of the new study, said about the potential effects of the shingles vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000e3b6nrmpundx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That means that the vaccine doesn’t just have a preventive potential, but actually a therapeutic potential as a treatment, because we see some benefits already among those who have dementia,” he said. “To me, this was really exciting to see and unexpected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000g3b6nngfrr3dp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study comes just months after Geldsetzer and his colleagues previously found evidence that shingles vaccination may offer a “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;dementia-preventing&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;dementia-delaying&lt;/a&gt;” effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000h3b6nx972rp0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that previous study, the researchers analyzed the health records of older adults in Wales, where a &lt;a href="https://phw.nhs.wales/topics/immunisation-and-vaccines/vaccines-professionals/shingles-information-for-health-professionals/" target="_blank"&gt;shingles vaccination program&lt;/a&gt; for adults in their 70s was introduced on September 1, 2013. The program indicated that anyone who was 79 on that date was eligible for the vaccine for one year, but those who were 80 or older were not eligible for the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000i3b6nqe9c7u5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those eligibility requirements allowed the researchers to examine data on the adults who were 79 and got vaccinated and then compare that data with the adults who were 80 and not eligible for vaccination but may have gotten the vaccine if they could.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000j3b6nn0nhzn61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are comparing groups of patients whose only difference is a tiny difference in age, just like a week or so, and they have this massive difference in the probability of ever getting vaccinated because of these unique eligibility rules,” Geldsetzer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000k3b6ntvo6zi6q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among those adults in Wales, the researchers found that receiving the shingles vaccine reduced the probability of being newly diagnosed with dementia by 3.5 percentage points over a seven-year period, compared with not receiving the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000l3b6nojrvxxd7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know they should have similar physical activity level, diets, et cetera,” Geldsetzer said. “So, we’re much more confident that what we’re actually looking at here is cause and effect, rather than just correlation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000n3b6n92jh3b1x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, in the new follow-up study, the same researchers analyzed the same data set of the adults in Wales, which included more than 282,500 adults. But this time, the researchers examined differences in the occurrence of mild cognitive impairment diagnoses and, among people already living with dementia, differences in the incidence of deaths due to dementia, while comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000o3b6neu0injcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The key strength of our natural experiments is that these comparison groups should be similar in all characteristics except for a minute difference in age,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000p3b6nmoy7c0us@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To strengthen their findings, the researchers also analyzed similar health records in Australia, which has a similar shingles vaccination program as Wales.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000q3b6nes9cs94f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers found that among older adults without any record of cognitive impairment prior to getting vaccinated, among those who received the shingles vaccine saw a reduction of 3.1 percentage points in their risk of being newly diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment over a nine-year period compared with those who did not receive the vaccine. And the protective effects appeared to be stronger among women than men, which was also found in the previous study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000r3b6n5lm5u4xi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, among older adults already living with dementia, the researchers found that those who received the shingles vaccine saw a drop of 29.5 percentage points in their risk of dying due to the disease over a nine-year period compared with those who did not get vaccinated – suggesting that the vaccine may play a role in slowing the progression of dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000s3b6neo4f6v1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It seems to have these strong benefits across the entire disease course,” Geldsetzer said about the shingles vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000u3b6n1in6tgnw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the new study turned a spotlight on the possible relationship between shingles vaccination and dementia outcomes, it did not specifically uncover why the vaccine may have these potential effects. But Geldsetzer had some theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000v3b6nwisghwed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Broadly speaking, you can think about two mechanisms,” Geldsetzer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000w3b6n1z1cilra@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one, the &lt;a href="https://www.nyp.org/patients-and-visitors/advances-consumers/issues/understanding-the-connection-between-chickenpox-and-shingles" target="_blank"&gt;same virus that causes shingles&lt;/a&gt; also causes chickenpox. After someone has chickenpox in childhood, the virus remains dormant in the nervous system and people get shingles when the virus reactivates in their bodies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000x3b6nsk7d8rwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even while the virus is hibernating in the nervous system, “this causes a constant interplay with the immune system,” Geldsetzer said. “We know this causes inflammation in the nervous system, and we know inflammation is a key process in so many chronic diseases, including dementia. So, it makes sense that reducing these reactivations through shingles vaccination may have benefits for the dementia disease process.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000y3b6nvb7q4i38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The second possible mechanism, Geldsetzer said, is that the vaccine can provide a big boost to the immune system overall, strengthening it as a whole to fight off infections. And there is a growing body of research linking various &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/possible-risks-of-dementia/infections#?c" target="_blank"&gt;infections to increased dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, so being better fit to fight off any infection could help with lowering dementia risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr000z3b6nt5n2c6wx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s increasing evidence that vaccines have broader effects on the immune system, beyond just the specific antibody response that it has been designed to elicit,” Geldsetzer said. “These kinds of broader immune system activations may well have benefits for dementia disease development as well, and we know the immune system plays a key role in dementia. So that’s the other mechanism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioooezr00103b6nfsuqocgl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Geldsetzer said that, as a next step, he and his colleagues plan to raise funding to “conclusively test” this link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risks in a randomized clinical trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmioo1d1400003b6np2m6c2sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the new study shows that the shingles vaccine protects cognition from early to late stages of dementia, Dr. Angelina Sutin, professor of behavioral sciences and social medicine at Florida State University College of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000163b6nvpbaxiwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When people find out that I study dementia, they often ask what I recommend to keep the brain healthy with age. I always respond with three things: exercise, be social, and do things you enjoy that make you feel purposeful. Now, I will add talk to your doctor about getting the shingles vaccine. There is no guarantee that doing these things means you will not get dementia, but all are relatively easy and accessible and help maintain healthy cognition for longer,” Sutin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000173b6ns9ed48zq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she added that what exactly may be driving this relationship between the shingles vaccine and reduced dementia risks remains a mystery.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiop8ob000183b6ntr5ivrqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is still unknown. This study is a very important advance in understanding because it provides the closest to causal evidence for the shingles vaccine that is possible. Unfortunately, it does not directly answer the why,” she said. “This research sets a strong foundation for future research to find out why it is so protective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmios0rbb00063b6nlce3f280@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist at NYU Langone, notes an important caveat about the study: the findings may not generalize to a newer vaccine that is now widely used.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmios1vjz00093b6npsojctqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would view these results as promising, providing unique evidence that shingles vaccination may have meaningful cognitive benefits, but not yet as definitive proof that we should vaccinate solely for dementia risk reduction,” Salinas said. “It’s reasonable to frame the connection as biologically plausible and increasingly well-supported by high-quality epidemiologic data, but still in need of mechanistic studies and replication before we can say definitively why shingles vaccination appears to be associated with lower dementia risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;New research shows that terminally ill baby ants tell other ants to kill them, potentially protecting the rest of the colony from their infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-66175-z"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal Nature Communications, researchers revealed that ant pupae—what a larva grows into before becoming an adult—of the &lt;em&gt;Lasius neglectus&lt;/em&gt; ant species actively produce a chemical signal that causes other colony members to destroy them. The findings further solidify the view of an ant colony as a “superorganism” behaving as a single entity rather than a community of many individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Selfless ants&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sick individuals often conceal their disease status to group members, thereby preventing social exclusion or aggression,” the researchers wrote in the paper. On the other hand, researchers have documented sick adult ants leaving their colony to avoid spreading their disease. Pupae, however, are encased in a cocoon and cannot leave, so they resort to a rather extreme strategy&lt;span&gt;—emitting a chemical signal essentially calling for self-destruction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Adult ants that approach death leave the nest to die outside the colony. Similarly, workers that have been exposed to fungal spores practice social distancing,” Sylvia Cremer, co-author of the study and group leader of the Cremer Group at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA), said in an ISTA statement. “Yet, this is only possible for mobile individuals. Ant brood within the colony, like infected cells in tissue, are largely immobile and lack this option.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Once worker ants receive the signal, they take the pupae from the cocoon, punch holes into them, and inject them with formic acid—an antimicrobial poison that works like a self-produced disinfectant. This kills the pathogens but also the pupae.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While previous research had demonstrated that worker ants can recognize sick pupae and kill them to disinfect the nest, scientists didn’t know if passive cues or intentional signaling by the sick pupae triggered this dynamic. To shed light on the matter, the scientists behind the new study infected &lt;em&gt;Lasius neglectus&lt;/em&gt; ants with a fungal pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;BO as a warning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the experiment, sick worker pupae emitted a modified body smell (the chemical signal) that warned the adult ants to destroy them. Only sick ants near adult worker ants produced this signal, indicating that the cue isn’t just an immune response or side effect of infection. When the researchers applied the smell to healthy pupae, they were also destroyed, confirming the chemical’s role in triggering the response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because workers destroy specific pupae within an entire &lt;a href="https://www.ant-shack.com/blogs/ant-articles/the-importance-of-ant-brood-care-nurturing-the-next-generation?srsltid=AfmBOoo4t6Bay3EDJJ1SxrfgpZqKO7xebay3dzSlKkr_Ad2-yM-UqotB"&gt;brood&lt;/a&gt; (eggs, larvae, and pupae) pile, “the scent cannot simply diffuse through the nest chamber but must be directly associated with the diseased pupa,” explained Thomas Schmitt, co-author of the study and a chemical ecologist from the University of Würzburg. “Accordingly, the signal does not consist of volatile compounds but instead is made up of non-volatile compounds on the pupal body surface.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While colonies are technically communities made of many individual ants, they work as a single superorganism. Ants within a colony are like the cells in our body. For example, ant queens are responsible for producing offspring, and non-fertile workers are responsible for the colony’s maintenance and health. Similarly, our germline cells are responsible for the production of offspring, and our somatic cells execute all the other important tasks. Along those same lines, the signaling from terminally ill pupae mirrors the way our body’s cells release chemical cues—called the “find-me and eat-me signal”—for our immune cells, which then identify and destroy the signaling cells to eliminate the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Queen ants don’t need to be destroyed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For ants, “what appears to be self-sacrifice at first glance is, in fact, also beneficial to the signaler: it safeguards its nestmates, with whom it shares many genes. By warning the colony of their deadly infection, terminally ill ants help the colony remain healthy and produce daughter colonies, which indirectly pass on the signaler’s genes to the next generation,” explained Erika Dawson, first author of the study and a behavioral ecologist at ISTA. If a terminally ill ant pretended to be healthy and died, it could become infectious and endanger the whole colony.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers did not observe queen pupae emit the chemical signal. They have stronger immune defenses than worker pupae and can restrict the infection independently. Worker pupae, however, couldn’t control the infection and warned the colony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sick pupae only emit the signal when the infection is uncontrollable, empowering fellow ants to intervene in situations of real threats while avoiding the destruction of pupae that can recover. “This precise coordination between the individual and colony level is what makes this altruistic disease signaling so effective,” Cremer concluded.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

What’s more, only 20% of the nearly 96 million American adults who have prediabetes actually know that they have it. That’s because prediabetes is “silent” since there aren’t any signs or symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Despite those staggering statistics, there is a silver lining.

After some experimentation, these were the five habits that brought down Taylor’s blood sugars: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mixing brown rice with white rice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more vegetables at dinner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating fruits as snacks (but I still have the occasional brownie or bag of chips).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walking after meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following a regular weight-lifting program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Part of the reason that these action steps were so effective is that they were habits that Taylor found easy to incorporate into his day-to-day life. Fun was also a key piece of the puzzle for making movement more enjoyable (and sustainable). “Using an Apple Watch and playing a game like Pokémon Go or Pikmin Bloom motivated me to get my steps in,” says Taylor. You also don’t need to be in the gym every day to see results. Taylor found a workout routine that fit his schedule, settling on two to three full-body gym sessions per week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-dietitians-weigh-in-on-this-approach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Dietitians Weigh In on This Approach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They’re Realistic and Sustainable Habits  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sustainability is the name of the game when you are trying to stop prediabetes in its tracks. That’s one of the reasons why dietitians liked Taylor’s approach. “I really like that these tips focus on realistic, sustainable changes, which is exactly what helps with reversing prediabetes,” says &lt;a href="https://naturallygoodnutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kathryn Durston, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. However, as with all good advice you might find online, you may have to leave some tips that aren't quite the right fit for you. “It’s important to remember that everyone is on their own health journey, and while some changes may work efficiently for certain individuals, others may need additional guidance or support to achieve their goals,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-hippley/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share_via&amp;amp;utm_content=profile&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed., RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Create a More Balanced Snack with Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taylor’s tip to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2061187/these-are-the-12-most-filling-fruits-and-veggies-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;snack on fruit&lt;/a&gt; can be a smart way to ensure you get enough servings each day. Most of us fall short—only about 12% of US adults eat the recommended 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Even better, research suggests that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290557/is-eating-fruit-bad-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating more fruit&lt;/a&gt; actually reduces your odds of developing diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Our experts shared one way to level up your fruit snack: Make it more blood sugar-friendly by pairing it with some protein. “While fruit as a snack is great for fiber and micronutrients, it can still spike blood sugar on its own because it’s mostly carbohydrates. Instead, I recommend &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261071/yogurt-with-blueberries/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pairing fruit with a source of protein&lt;/a&gt; for a more blood-sugar-friendly snack. Add a cheese or meat stick, a strained Greek-style yogurt cup, or a bag of roasted chickpeas alongside your fruit,” says Durston.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Walking After Meals is Spot On &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pairing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy diet changes with physical activity&lt;/a&gt; doubles down on lowering your risk of prediabetes. Unfortunately, less than a quarter of US adults meet the recommended physical activity levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But the good news is that high-intensity workouts aren’t the only effective way to lower blood sugars, either—lacing up your shoes for an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7998411/walking-after-meals-lower-blood-sugar-science/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;after-meal walk&lt;/a&gt; like Taylor can be just as beneficial. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Start where you can, even if it’s for two minutes, and build from there. Increasing your walking time to 10-15 minutes can have an even greater impact on blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Veggies for the Win &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietitians wholeheartedly agreed with Taylor’s tip to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15316/how-to-eat-more-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporate more vegetables into your diet&lt;/a&gt;. “Non-starchy vegetables are high in fiber and nutrients while low in calories, which supports better blood sugar control. Eating more of these vegetables can increase satiety and naturally encourage &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290482/what-does-a-healthy-serving-of-carbs-look-like/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;smaller portions of carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; at meals,” says Hippley. While Taylor talks about adding more veggies to dinner, there’s no reason to stop there. “Besides more vegetables at dinner, I would recommend incorporating vegetables with lunch, breakfast and snacks whenever possible,” says &lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sheri Gaw RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “Aim for at least 2-3 cups of vegetables per day to boost fiber, fullness and blood sugar balance,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-additional-lifestyle-changes-to-lower-hgba1c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Additional Lifestyle Changes to Lower HgbA1c &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond Taylor’s tips, here are some additional lifestyle changes that could help you manage prediabetes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Skimp on Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep likely isn’t top of mind when you’re trying to work on reversing prediabetes, but it’s more important than you might think. “Getting consistent, quality sleep helps regulate hormones, while chronic stress and poor sleep can raise insulin resistance and make blood sugar harder to control,” says Hippley.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portion Control:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to sorting out what to eat after a prediabetes diagnosis, consider how much you’re eating as well. “Focusing on portion control is often one of the first changes I recommend to patients because it allows them to continue enjoying their usual foods, but in a more balanced way,” Hippley explains. “Paying attention to smaller portions of carbohydrate-rich foods while increasing non-starchy vegetables can help manage blood sugar without feeling deprived,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for a Healthy Weight:&lt;/strong&gt; Weight loss isn’t always the answer when addressing prediabetes. However, studies show that it can be one tool that may help. “Just a small amount of weight loss, 5-7% of starting weight, can promote lower blood sugar and often reversal of prediabetes,” says Gaw.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; No matter the question, the internet has answers (for better or worse). However, when it comes to your health, it’s always worth checking in with an expert before implementing changes. In this case, dietitians had a lot of positive things to say about one Redditor’s experience with reversing their prediabetes. Research supports the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-tweaks-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-11792895" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;significant impact lifestyle changes can have on diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt; and dietitians appreciated that Taylor’s tips were realistic and sustainable. It’s worth trying out a few for yourself!&lt;br&gt;

Research shows that protein helps maintain lean body mass, supports healthy aging by preventing muscle loss (sarcopenia), and enhances feelings of fullness, which can aid in weight management. It also contributes to stabilizing blood sugar levels, supporting muscle recovery after physical activity, and keeping metabolism active. Protein is involved in hormone production, immune function, and tissue repair. Daily protein requirements vary depending on factors like age, gender, activity level, and overall health, making individualized intake important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26797090/"&gt;general recommendation&lt;/a&gt; for a healthy adult is around 0.8 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which is the minimum needed for basic health. &lt;br&gt;For better muscle maintenance, metabolic health, or active lifestyles, recommend protein intake is around&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861013003265"&gt; 1.2 g/kg/day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those involved in&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6090881/"&gt; regular exercise or strength training&lt;/a&gt;, a higher intake around 1.4–2.0 g/kg/day, is suggested to support muscle repair and growth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>数据支持美国目前对新生儿接种乙型肝炎疫苗的政策，因为官员们正在推动变革-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/data-supports-us-policy-hepatitis-b-vaccine-newborns-officials-push-delay-2025-12-02/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:12:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3gFBVV95cUxOSVIydUxQSElybjNaSkcwZnhZVjVCV3dGdWlTZVd0UFFDOElROEZXVzNud2ZfUll6N1pPc05KMU9kUURFa3RTVk80cFFqSTgtM2J4MXJHTV9SNXJrMTc0ODFtUTFXNHJES0JpZllyOWlVVjJEWEdQSjM2QS15b3R6OXdtRGNYTndRLXJ2VDJITWxqaGR5cEt5eXMwc3ZBbmJkQVhRa1hWc09VdWRBclphckNsQkFkWVhXcGJjSlV0ckJsQnh0blM3dVVwSXQ0ZkwwdzdBbjhOZkhHU1cyM2c</guid></item><item><title>心脏病发作提前10年发出警告！早期血压变化如何揭示减少长期汽车的迹象-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/heart-attack-warns-10-years-before-how-early-blood-pressure-changes-reveal-signs-to-reduce-long-term-cardiovascular-risk/articleshow/125714166.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks and cardiovascular diseases remain the leading causes of death worldwide. Millions of people lose their lives each year due to heart-related conditions, often because the early warning signs are unnoticed or ignored. Dr Sanjay Bhojraj, a board-certified cardiologist and functional medicine specialist with over 20 years of experience, highlights the importance of recognising subtle changes in blood pressure as early indicators of heart disease. According to him, these changes can predict heart attacks up to a decade before typical symptoms such as chest pain or fatigue appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large real-world &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.122.028762" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;examined the long-term cardiovascular risk linked to Stage 1 Hypertension in over 96,000 individuals, with blood pressure measured in 2006 and 2010. The research aimed to estimate both 10-year and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to understand how changes in blood pressure over time affect future risk. Results showed that people with Stage 1 Hypertension had a 35 % higher 10-year risk and a 36 % higher lifetime risk of CVD compared to those with normal blood pressure. Progression to more severe hypertension increased the 10-year risk by over 150 %. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection and management are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early &lt;keyword id="24457019" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="blood-pressure-changes" source="keywords"&gt;blood pressure changes&lt;/keyword&gt; reveal heart stress years before symptoms&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, heart attacks are rarely completely sudden. The body often gives subtle signals long before a cardiac event occurs. Many of these signals are related to blood pressure, which reflects the condition of the heart and arteries. Slight, gradual changes in blood pressure over time may indicate that the cardiovascular system is under strain, even if overall readings appear normal during routine check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj explains, “In the past, I treated patients only after they experienced symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest discomfort, or fatigue. By that stage, their cardiovascular system had been under stress for years without anyone noticing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does stage 1 hypertension predict 10-year heart disease risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research and clinical experience show that certain patterns in blood pressure can act as early predictors of heart attacks. Dr Bhojraj identifies four key indicators that should not be ignored:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subtle blood pressure variability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even minor fluctuations in blood pressure across days or weeks can signal that the heart is working harder than normal. These variations may not trigger symptoms but can indicate early vascular ageing and increased cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morning blood pressure surges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure often rises naturally in the morning, but excessive or sharp morning surges are linked to a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Monitoring morning readings can reveal patterns that indicate the cardiovascular system is under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy blood pressure pattern includes a natural dip during sleep. If blood pressure remains elevated at night, it may indicate autonomic dysfunction or early arterial damage, which are significant risk factors for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of autonomic flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure, heart rate, and other essential functions. A decline in its flexibility to adapt to stress or environmental changes may be an early sign of cardiovascular ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj stresses that recognising these patterns requires consistent monitoring over time rather than relying on single measurements at the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of &lt;keyword id="31229210" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="early-blood-pressure-monitoring" source="keywords"&gt;early blood pressure monitoring&lt;/keyword&gt; in heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pivotal moment in Dr Bhojraj’s career occurred when a patient suffered a sudden heart attack despite having normal cholesterol levels and a stable weight. Upon reviewing the patient’s history, he discovered that subtle blood pressure changes had been occurring for nearly a decade. This case demonstrated that heart disease is often not sudden but develops gradually, and early intervention is possible if risk factors are detected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following this realisation, Dr Bhojraj shifted his approach from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. He began analysing long-term blood pressure patterns while considering lifestyle factors such as sleep, stress, hormonal balance, and inflammation. This method allows him to identify patients at risk long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of addressing early blood pressure changes for heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By addressing early blood pressure changes, patients can significantly reduce their risk of heart attacks and improve overall health. Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased energy levels and vitality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved metabolic health and weight management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced resilience to physical and mental stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced cardiovascular age and stronger heart function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Bhojraj emphasises, “Prevention should not be a guessing game. Understanding your cardiovascular future early allows for meaningful changes that protect the heart and improve quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Monitoring blood pressure effectively&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular home monitoring is essential for detecting early warning signs. Automated blood pressure monitors can track readings over time, and maintaining a detailed record allows patients and doctors to observe subtle trends. Dr Bhojraj also recommends considering lifestyle factors such as sleep quality, diet, stress levels, and physical activity, as these directly impact blood pressure patterns and long-term heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;p&gt;Twenty-one children are among 33 people who have died in Cuba of the mosquito-borne chikungunya and dengue viruses since July, authorities said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the deaths were attributed to chikungunya — characterized by fever and joint pain that can be debilitating but rarely fatal — while the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-dengue-fever-virus-symptoms-vaccine-treatment/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu-like dengue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; claimed 12 lives, the country's deputy health minister Carilda Pena said on state TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chikungunya virus emerged in Cuba's western Matanzas province in July, but soon spread to all 15 provinces of the country of 9.7 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chikungunya virus was first identified in Africa in the early 1950s. Chikungunya's symptoms include severe joint aches, fever, and fatigue, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms usually start within three to seven days after a bite from an infected mosquito, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people recover within a week, according to the agency, though some experience severe joint pain for months or even years after their illness. Deaths are rare, the CDC says. Newborns infected around the time of birth, people over 65, and people with preexisting medical conditions are most likely to experience severe illness, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, the communist island has been afflicted by an outbreak of dengue that hit as Cuba battles shortages of clean water, food, fuel and medicine during its worst economic crisis in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuba, long known for its medical and pharmaceutical expertise, was able to deal a swift blow to a previous chikungunya outbreak in 2014. There is no specific treatment for the disease, but vaccines are available and recommended for people visiting an area experiencing an outbreak, the CDC says. The disease can't be spread from person to person.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the one-party state reports, the outbreak spiraled out of control due to "lack of hygiene, accumulated garbage" and people storing water in tanks to mitigate the intermittent availability of clean tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the country under U.S. sanctions and its critical tourism sector left in ruins by Covid, a dearth of foreign currency has seen a steep decline in Cuba's medical services and prevention programs such as mosquito fumigation.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the first such case reported in the U.S. since 2019. Multiple other chikungunya cases have been reported in the U.S., but they were linked to international travel. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Between Halloween candy, Thanksgiving pies and holiday cookies, the end of the year is often packed with opportunities to consume sugar. But what happens in your mouth during those first minutes and hours after eating those sweets? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you’re likely aware that eating too much sugar &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/sugars-and-dental-caries"&gt;can cause cavities&lt;/a&gt; – that is, damage to your teeth – you might be less familiar with how bacteria use those sugars to build a sticky film called plaque on your teeth as soon as you take that first sweet bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=AiaIuhoAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;We are a team of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tHlHSigAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;microbiologists that studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://lemos-abranches.dental.ufl.edu/"&gt;how oral bacteria cause tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what happens in your mouth the moment sugar passes your lips – and how to protect your teeth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An acid plunge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within seconds of your first bite or sip of something sugary, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-023-00963-6"&gt;bacteria that make the human mouth their home&lt;/a&gt; start using those dietary sugars to grow and multiply. In the process of converting those sugars into energy, these bacteria &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3402/jom.v6.24878"&gt;produce large quantities of acids&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, just a minute or two after consuming  high-sugar foods or drinks, the acidity of your mouth increases into &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10266-012-0092-z"&gt;levels that can dissolve enamel&lt;/a&gt; – that is, the minerals making up the surface of your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/704308/original/file-20251124-62-q4ss3m.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Sweets present a delicious assault on your teeth.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/table-top-view-of-baked-delights-royalty-free-image/1418906817"&gt;Nazar Abbas Photography/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0003-9969(99)00119-3"&gt;saliva comes to the rescue&lt;/a&gt; before these acids can start corroding the surface of your teeth. It washes away excess sugars while also neutralizing the acids in your mouth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mouth is also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2024.2389386"&gt;home to other bacteria that compete&lt;/a&gt; with cavity-causing bacteria for resources and space, fighting them off and restoring the acidity of your mouth to levels that aren’t harmful to teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, frequent consumption of sweets and sugary drinks can overfeed harmful bacteria in a way that neither saliva nor helpful bacteria can overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An assault on enamel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cavity-causing bacteria also use dietary sugars to make a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/unlocking-the-secrets-of-bacterial-biofilms-to-use-against-them-59148"&gt;sticky layer called a biofilm&lt;/a&gt; that acts like a fortress attached to the teeth. Biofilms are very hard to remove without mechanical force, such as from routinely brushing your teeth or cleaning at the dentist’s office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Microbes form vast communities called biofilms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, biofilms impose a physical barrier that restricts what crosses its border, such that saliva can no longer do its job of neutralizing acid as well. To make matters worse, while cavity-causing bacteria are able to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.2008/023770-0"&gt;survive in these acidic conditions&lt;/a&gt;, the good bacteria fighting them cannot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these protected fortresses, cavity-causing bacteria are able to keep multiplying, keeping the acidity level of the mouth elevated and leading to further loss of tooth minerals until a cavity becomes visible or painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to protect your (sweet) teeth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before eating your next sugary treat, there are a few measures you can take to help keep the cavity-forming bacteria at bay and your teeth safe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, try to reduce the amount of sugar you eat and consume your sugary food or drink during a meal. This way, the increased saliva production that occurs while eating can help wash away sugars and neutralize acids in your mouth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, avoid snacking on sweets and sugary drinks throughout the day, especially those containing table sugar or high-fructose corn syrup. Continually exposing your mouth to sugar will keep its acidity level higher for longer periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember to brush regularly, especially after meals, to remove as much dental plaque as possible. Daily flossing also helps remove plaque from areas that your toothbrush cannot reach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;On the first Sunday after being named leader of the Catholic Church in May 2025, Pope Leo XIV stood on the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/zJUsFTxDOMk?si=qZvqqqi07SNl8uK5&amp;amp;t=2067"&gt;addressed the tens of thousands of people gathered&lt;/a&gt;. Invoking tradition, he led the people in noontime prayer. But rather than reciting it, as his predecessors generally did, he sang. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chanting the &lt;a href="https://www.usccb.org/prayers/regina-caeli"&gt;traditional Regina Caeli&lt;/a&gt;, the pope inspired &lt;a href="https://www.thecatholicthing.org/2025/08/18/pope-leo-xiv-inspires-a-rebirth-of-gregorian-chant/"&gt;what some have called a rebirth&lt;/a&gt; of Gregorian chant, a type of monophonic and unaccompanied singing done in Latin that dates back more than a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vatican has been at the forefront of that push, launching an online initiative to teach Gregorian chant through short educational tutorials called “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRK0IuJlKq8&amp;amp;list=PL1-YYOFc-KJPLnuQ_0p6ZXnybb-RsCrah&amp;amp;index=2"&gt;Let’s Sing with the Pope&lt;/a&gt;.” The stated goals of the initiative are to give Catholics worldwide an opportunity to “participate actively in the liturgy” and to “make the rich heritage of Gregorian chant accessible to all.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These goals resonated with me. As &lt;a href="https://artsci.washu.edu/faculty-staff/elinor-harrison"&gt;a performing artist and scientist of human movement&lt;/a&gt;, I spent the past decade developing therapeutic techniques involving &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31986952/"&gt;singing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32878538/"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; to help people with neurological disorders. Much like the pope’s initiative, these arts-based therapies require active participation, promote connection, and are accessible to anyone. Indeed, not only is singing a deeply ingrained human cultural activity, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35315920/"&gt;research increasingly shows how good it is for us&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The same old song and dance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 15 years, I worked as a professional dancer and singer. In the course of that career, I became convinced that creating art through movement and song was integral to my well-being. Eventually, I decided to shift gears and study the science underpinning my longtime passion by looking at the benefits of dance for people with Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neurological condition, &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/statistics"&gt;which affects over 10 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, is caused by neuron loss in an area of the brain that is involved in movement and rhythmic processing – the basal ganglia. The disease causes a range of debilitating motor impairments, including walking instability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;A woman sings as part of a chorus for Parkinson’s patients and their care partners at a YMCA in Hanover, Mass., on Feb. 13, 2019.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/maureen-healy-of-scituate-sings-along-as-part-of-a-newly-news-photo/1127411734?adppopup=true"&gt;David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on in my training, I suggested that people with Parkinson’s could improve the rhythm of their steps if they sang while they walked. Even as we began publishing our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2017.02.008"&gt;initial feasibility studies&lt;/a&gt;, people remained skeptical. Wouldn’t it be too hard for people with motor impairment to do two things at once? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my own experience of singing and dancing simultaneously since I was a child suggested it could be innate. While Broadway performers do this at an extremely high level of artistry, singing and dancing are not limited to professionals. We teach children nursery rhymes with gestures; we spontaneously nod our heads to a favorite song; we sway to the beat while singing at a baseball game. Although people with Parkinson’s typically &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2012/918719"&gt;struggle to do two tasks at once&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps singing and moving were such natural activities that they could reinforce each other rather than distract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A scientific case for song&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are, in effect, hardwired to sing and dance, and we likely evolved to do so. In every known culture, evidence exists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax0868"&gt;of music, singing or chanting&lt;/a&gt;. The oldest discovered musical instruments are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08169"&gt;ivory and bone flutes&lt;/a&gt; dating back &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.03.003"&gt;over 40,000 years&lt;/a&gt;. Before people played music, they likely sang. The discovery of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.07.006"&gt;60,000-year-old hyoid bone&lt;/a&gt; shaped like a modern human’s suggests our Neanderthal ancestors could sing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2300"&gt;The Descent of Man&lt;/a&gt;,” Charles Darwin speculated that a musical protolanguage, analogous to birdsong, was driven by sexual selection. Whatever the reason, singing and chanting have been integral parts of spiritual, cultural and healing practices around the world for thousands of years. Chanting practices, in which repetitive sounds &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12111456"&gt;are used to induce altered states of consciousness&lt;/a&gt; and connect with the spiritual realm, are ancient and diverse in their roots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the evolutionary reasons remain disputed, modern science is increasingly validating what many traditions have long held: Singing and chanting can have profound benefits to physical, mental and social health, with both immediate and long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically, the act of producing sound can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-000996"&gt;strengthen the lungs and diaphragm and increase the amount of oxygen in the blood&lt;/a&gt;. Singing can also lower heart rate and blood pressure, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcm.2021.06.004"&gt;reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocalizing can even improve your immune system, as active music participation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jmt/39.1.30"&gt;can increase levels of immunoglobulin A&lt;/a&gt;, one of the body’s key antibodies to stave off illness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singing also improves mood and reduces stress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that singing lowers cortisol levels, the primary stress hormone, in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2016.631"&gt;healthy adults and people with cancer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1569601"&gt;neurologic disorders&lt;/a&gt;. Singing may also rebalance autonomic nervous system activity by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/23268263.2024.2416265"&gt;stimulating the vagus nerve&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.727231"&gt;improving the body’s ability to respond to environmental stresses&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200518-why-singing-can-make-you-feel-better-in-lockdown"&gt;this is why singing has been called&lt;/a&gt; “the world’s most accessible stress reliever.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/woman-performs-the-cant-de-la-sibil-la-during-the-midnight-news-photo/1880792059?adppopup=true"&gt;saac Buj/Europa Press via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, chanting may make you aware of your inner states while connecting to something larger. Repetitive chanting, as is common in rosary recitation and yogic mantras, can induce a meditative state, inducing mindfulness and altered states of consciousness. Neuroimaging &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40200-w"&gt;studies show that chanting activates&lt;/a&gt; brainwaves associated with suspension of self-oriented and stress-related thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Singing as community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singing alone is one thing, but singing with others brings about a host of other benefits, as anyone who has sung in a choir can likely attest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group singing provides a mood boost and improves overall well-being. Increased levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin during singing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2021.105105"&gt;may promote feelings of social connection and bonding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people sing in unison, they &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024893"&gt;synchronize not just their breath but also their heart rates&lt;/a&gt;. Heart rate variability, a measure of the body’s adaptability to stress, also &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.00762/full"&gt;improves during group singing&lt;/a&gt;, whether you’re an expert or a novice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-33942-6"&gt;singing has proven useful in yet another way&lt;/a&gt;: as a cue for movement. Matching footfalls to one’s own singing is an effective tool for improving walking that is better than passive listening. Seemingly, active vocalization requires a level of engagement, attention and effort that can translate into improved motor patterns. For people with Parkinson’s, for example, this simple activity can help them avoid a fall. We have shown that people with the disease, in spite of neural degeneration, activate &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40134419/"&gt;similar brain regions as healthy controls&lt;/a&gt;. And it works &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6744333/"&gt;even when you sing in your head&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose to sing with the pope or not, you don’t need a mellifluous voice like his to raise your voice in song. You can sing in the shower. Join a choir. Chant that “om” at the end of yoga class. Releasing your voice might be easier than you think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, besides, it’s good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

What makes this even more startling, is that cancer is particulary tricky to treat, especially if it is diagnosed at a later stage, and is aggressive. While Cancer can eventually go into remission stage, (meaning that there are no current cancer traces in the body), it is also highly preventable, with the right diet, exercise, and lifestyle habits. Research indicates that specific lifestyle choices help people decrease their cancer risk through immune system enhancement, cell protection and inflammation reduction.

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;Test your pushup count after 50 and use these 5 moves to build elite upper-body strength.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Pushups don’t lie. After 50, you can tell a lot about someone’s strength, joint health, and overall fitness by how many they can perform. And unlike machine exercises that guide your movements, pushups require raw strength that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7196742/" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows puts your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core to the test. That means if you can crank out a high number of pushups with good form, your upper body is elite for your age group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with &lt;b&gt;James Brady&lt;/b&gt;, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.origym.co.uk/blog/author/jbrady/" target="_blank"&gt;OriGym&lt;/a&gt;, who tells us, “For people over 50, being able to perform &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-many-pushups-prove-upper-body-strength-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;30 or more pushups&lt;/a&gt; for men and 20 or more for women puts you in the elite range. These numbers show exceptional upper body and core strength for your age group.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brady explains that hitting those reps not only exemplifies &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/8-minute-standing-routine-builds-strength-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;real strength&lt;/a&gt;, but also reflects muscle endurance, coordination, and excellent joint stability. He adds, “Hitting those reps means you’ve maintained muscle mass, coordination, and cardiovascular health well beyond the average, showing that your body is aging exceptionally well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2807854" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that better muscular strength is linked to lower all-cause mortality risk. Additionally, pushups specifically have been shown to be a benchmark for healthy aging. According to a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2724778" target="_blank" data-citation="true" data-citation-type="ScholarlyArticle"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt;, men who could complete 40 or more pushups had a 96 percent lower risk of cardiovascular events, compared to those who could do fewer than 10. While this particular study focused on men, the takeaway applies to all gender identifications, which is that upper-body endurance is an excellent indicator of metabolic and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But pushups are only part of the picture. To reach (or surpass) the elite rep range Brady suggests, you need balanced strength across your entire upper body and core. The following five exercises work together to help you build the pressing power, shoulder stability, posterior-chain strength, and core power that make high pushup numbers possible after 50.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="incline-pushups" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incline Pushups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yAbg3_pJKvw?si=LieF4uNY_1uYeFmc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re aiming to increase your pushup count, this is the foundational movement to master. Incline pushups reduce the load while allowing you to perfect form and gradually build joint resilience and chest and tricep strength. Also, they strengthen the same muscles as floor pushups but in a safer, more controlled way for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands on a countertop, bench, or sturdy table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your feet back until your body forms a straight line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your chest toward the surface while keeping elbows at roughly 45-degree angles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push back to the starting position with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 10 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="standing-chest-press-with-bands" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing Chest Press with Bands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nm4PNUjDnpQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating resistance bands into your pushup exercises will add constant tension, helping you build strength throughout the entire movement. Resistance band presses also reinforces the scapular stability you need for pain-free pushups after 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loop a resistance band around a sturdy pole at chest height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the handles and step forward to create tension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press your hands forward until your arms are fully extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete three sets of 12 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="plank-holds" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plank Holds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pvIjsG5Svck?si=FGkFuAXJhOv1_2ux" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that elite pushup performers have elite core strength. If your midsection collapses during pushups, everything else collapses with it. That’s why including planks in your workouts will help strengthen the deep core stabilizing muscles that keep your spine aligned so your arms can generate maximum force for doing as many pushups as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your elbows under your shoulders and step your feet back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core without allowing your hips to sag or lift too high.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold for 20 to 40 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat three times with 60 to 90 seconds of rest between holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="bent-over-dumbbell-rows" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bent-Over Dumbbell Rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HUp6djHa37Y?si=GRmcLTeddyhituNE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds counterintuitive, but pushup strength requires a strong back. Dumbbell rows balance your push muscles, reinforce shoulder mechanics, and prevent rounded posture, all of which can help improve pushup endurance and help you do a few more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold dumbbells at your sides and hinge forward slightly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull the weights toward your ribcage (imagine pulling the dumbbell toward your back pocket) while squeezing your shoulder blades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aim for three sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="tricep-dips-chair-or-bench" class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tricep Dips (Chair or Bench)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjdpMVtMehw?si=et7t9P-fD1MhOBCR" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your triceps (back of your upper arm) are engaged big time during pushups. Doing tricep dips will strengthen that lockout phase and build arm endurance so you don’t fatigue early during pushups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit on the edge of a sturdy bench with your hands beside your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slide off the edge of the bench and lower your body down by bending your elbows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push back to the starting position while keeping your shoulders down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform three sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (VINnews) — This week we read in the Torah that a man [who was an ange] wrestled with Yaakov and “When he saw that he could not prevail against him, he touched the socket of his hip,” and Yaakov was left limping. For a young man in Maaleh Adumim, the pain in his hip nearly cost him his life, as reported by “Jerusalem Haredim”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nadav Menashe, a 23-year-old from Ma’ale Adumim, recently felt a series of intensifying pains in the pelvic area which brought his routine to a halt. At first, he was sure it was just overexertion, but as the pain became daily and increasingly severe, he sought medical evaluation. A doctor who suspected a slipped disc sent him for an MRI, and by chance, an image that “spilled over” slightly into the pelvic region revealed an unusual finding. Further testing at the hospital revealed that Nadav had a rare cancerous tumor threatening his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the shock, Nadav chose a mindset of faith and resilience. “It is disappointing, but I believe everything is from G-d and that everything is for the best,” he said. The doctors explained that the only way to save his life was through an especially complex surgery. Nadav decided to undergo the procedure at the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center, led by Dr. Omer Or, head of the Orthopedic Oncology Unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgery lasted about 15 hours and involved a multidisciplinary team using advanced technologies. Dr. Or noted that it was a rare procedure aimed at removing the tumor entirely while preserving future pelvic function. The surgical team used computer-guided navigation systems — a kind of “medical GPS” — and 3D-printed models for precise planning and resection. In a unique stage of the operation, a bone graft was taken from Nadav’s leg and implanted into his pelvis, allowing reconstruction of the bone structure and preservation of the hip joint and his ability to walk in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lengthy surgery came the challenging rehabilitation phase. Nadav, who had been fully independent, found himself in a wheelchair and dependent on help for basic tasks. He transferred to the Gandel Rehabilitation Center at Hadassah Mount Scopus, where he learned again how to sit, stand, and later, walk. “The first time I managed to walk was amazing,” he recalled. “I suddenly realized it’s not just about walking, it’s about knowing you can trust your body again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, after an extended rehabilitation period and radiation treatments, Nadav walks with a cane and continues to progress with determination. He sums up his message simply and clearly: “I learned that nothing is to be taken for granted. Every day that you wake up and walk is a blessing. If something closes a door for you, it probably means another one was meant to open.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Whether poop speeds through your gut like a bullet train or takes a more smell-the-roses approach could have more profound implications for your overall health than a first glance would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328166"&gt;a 2023 review&lt;/a&gt; that brought together data from dozens of studies, distinct differences can be seen between the gut microbiomes of '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-well-is-your-gut-working-theres-a-grossly-simple-way-to-check"&gt;speeders' and 'slowpokes'&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the human gut microbiome is intrinsically linked to health, this could have implications that have gone unnoticed before now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, slow transit times and constipation have been linked with metabolic and inflammatory disorders, as well as neurological disorders such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the microbiome profiles associated with these gut transit times could help develop new ways to treat and manage these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-poop-schedule-says-a-lot-about-your-overall-health-suggests-study"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your Poop Schedule Says a Lot About Your Overall Health, Suggests Study&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By taking into account the interindividual and intraindividual differences in gut transit time, we can advance our understanding of diet–microbiota interactions and disease-related microbiome signatures," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328166"&gt;writes a team&lt;/a&gt; led by nutritionists Nicola Procházková and Henrik Roager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Altogether, a better understanding of the complex, bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and transit time is required to better understand gut microbiome variations in health and disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183237" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183237" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Mans-hands-holding-a-roll-of-toilet-paper-642x361.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a toilet, fully clothed, holding a roll of toilet paper.

(Ake Ngiamsanguan/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know the gut microbiome, both in composition and activity, plays &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-fungi-live-inside-you-and-they-may-affect-your-health"&gt;an important role in health&lt;/a&gt;. We also know that it can be shaped by a variety of mechanisms, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifting-weights-could-change-your-gut-microbiome-within-weeks"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yo-yo-dieting-may-trigger-long-lasting-changes-in-gut-bacteria"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Procházková and her colleagues wanted to know if we were overlooking a very simple thing that could affect gut microbes: how long they spend hanging out with poop before it makes its way to the wild &lt;a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/loo"&gt;loo&lt;/a&gt; yonder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team tapped into previously published research on participants' gut transit time, including stool consistency (a proxy for transit time), diet, the composition of their microbiomes, and the metabolites produced by those microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-pooping-habits-could-harm-your-health-in-7-ways-research-shows"&gt;Your Pooping Habits Could Harm Your Health in 7 Ways, Research Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results incorporated studies that collectively had thousands of patients, both healthy people and people with conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-irritable-bowel-syndrome-and-what-can-i-do-about-it"&gt;irritable bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;, constipation, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-daily-habits-could-be-causing-your-liver-serious-harm"&gt;liver cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding gut transit time isn't as simple as keeping a record of one's poop schedule. It can involve special swallowable capsules equipped with sensors that record their journey through the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another approach is the Bristol Stool Scale, a visual diagnostic tool that classifies poop based on consistency, from hard, rock-like pellets (long transit time) to a watery mush (short transit time). Some studies track how long it takes participants to pass ingested blue dye or sweet corn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All have the same goal: to estimate how long food stays in the colon. The longer the stay, the more time bacteria have to ferment the contents, regulate the gut's acidity, and produce metabolites that can influence the health of the body in multiple ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-a-silent-killer-cancer-may-hide-in-your-poop"&gt;An Early Warning Signal of a 'Silent Killer' Cancer May Hide in Your Poop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the results of the team's analysis were fascinating. People with fast gut transit times had dramatically different microbiomes from people with slower transit times. Adding transit times to the patient data provided better predictions of gut microbiota than simply examining diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, those with faster gut transit times tended to have microbiomes dominated by faster-growing species that thrive on a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. Slower transit times, meanwhile, were sometimes dominated by species that thrive on protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these extremes also had lower gut microbiome diversity than people with average gut transit times, suggesting that fast and slow movement creates environments where specialist species come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would then create a feedback loop in which the dominant species in each environment releases metabolites that maintain the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results suggest that gut transit time is an overlooked tool for understanding how the gut works, the role it plays in overall health, and how patients respond to treatments such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/probiotics-vs-prebiotics-whats-the-difference-and-do-you-need-both"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-most-expensive-coffee-is-chemically-different-because-its-literally-poop"&gt;World's Most Expensive Coffee Is Chemically Different Because It's Literally Poop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may also help explain why the same gut health advice may not work for everyone. Two people can eat the exact same meal and get two very different results, depending on how fast their poop usually moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transit times may even influence how your body responds to probiotics and certain supplements or medications that interact with the gut. This suggests that recognizing the individual gut rhythm of the patient could help tailor treatments and dietary advice that precisely matches their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By including gut transit time measurements in gut microbiome-related studies, we can advance our understanding of the links between the gut microbiome, diet and disease," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328166"&gt;the researchers write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such insights may be key for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of several diseases in the gut and beyond throughout the lifespan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in 2023 in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328166"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gut&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;don’t eat certain products&lt;/a&gt; or ingredients for a variety of reasons. Some might dislike the texture or the taste; others, like vegetarians or vegans, don’t eat some products because of ethical reasons. But having allergies is much more serious than just a simple preference or intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="c2d40399-b249-4bc9-9140-58e8b788e679"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/expert-answers/food-allergy/faq-20058538" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, a food allergy causes the body’s immune system to react, and the symptoms can be life-threatening. A food intolerance, for example, would only cause digestive issues like gas, bloating, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="da0be02f-3644-4bdf-a898-5d15556b79c4"&gt;However, some people treat their food intolerances or dislikes as seriously as allergies. They might go so far as to believe they have a food allergy when they, in fact, do not have one. In 2019, researchers &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2720064" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that half of Americans who think they have or claim to have a food allergy actually don’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="79f533ef-4033-4c27-ba01-b70aea70005c"&gt;In their study, the researchers estimated that 10.8% of the respondents were allergic to at least one food. However, a whopping 19% believed they had a food allergy. The lead researcher of the study, Ruchi Gupta, who is also a professor of pediatrics at Northwestern University, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/04/half-of-people-who-think-they-have-a-food-allergy-do-not-study" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt;urges&lt;/a&gt; people to actually get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="88546872-6e90-46be-9319-f4c338411e4e"&gt;“There are so many adults out there who have a negative reaction to a food. It is really important to get a proper diagnosis so that they can really know if this is something treatable, like lactose intolerance, or if this is a life-threatening food allergy that they need to be very careful with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-block-id="d5ea180f-a5bc-45e8-b1ef-4347418f0fa4"&gt;Cibophobia is the fear of a certain food and can develop after we learn something negative about the said food&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="2-4" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/laughing-about-pretend-mushroom-allergy/?image_id=2-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Woman Reveals The Reason Why She Lied About Being Allergic To Mushrooms After Husband Confronts Her" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/laughing-about-pretend-mushroom-allergy/?media_id=2-4" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2-4.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9740475" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2-4.jpg" alt="Woman Reveals The Reason Why She Lied About Being Allergic To Mushrooms After Husband Confronts Her" title="Woman Reveals The Reason Why She Lied About Being Allergic To Mushrooms After Husband Confronts Her" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-poking-apple-fruit-3214281/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Engin Akyurt/Pexels (not the actual photo)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="2f99b2d7-b7c3-4499-bcee-637cf1f7077c"&gt;In the update, the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/thanksgiving" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; host revealed that her sister-in-law might have a phobia of mushrooms. This could explain why she freaked out after seeing mushrooms in her food despite having eaten them previously without knowing they were there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_desktop_post_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="43f8fb72-1047-45a2-b12b-a8ced7937887"&gt;There are several food phobia disorders. Cibophobia &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fear-of-food-5211181" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;is when&lt;/a&gt; a person has an irrational fear of a certain food. In some cases, people with cibophobia only eat a few foods, which can cause malnutrition. In other cases, they can’t eat meals that have been prepared by someone else, have unfamiliar ingredients, or are perishable. Cibophobia is not an eating disorder, yet it can go hand in hand with some EDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="f19b2caa-65a0-4a9d-9363-a732b138a087"&gt;How do some people develop cibophobia in the first place? For some, it might be similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/erased-wedding-photos-petty-revenge/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;sister-in-law&lt;/a&gt; in this story. They might read about the negative impacts of a certain food in the news, see it on social media, or hear it in a conversation with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="5cfe297c-9d2b-4884-8835-46bf7b11c3ac"&gt;Other times, they might have had a traumatic experience in the past. I, for example, started to dislike coffee after it made me violently ill one time while pulling an all-nighter in college. For other adults, cibophobia forms as they observe the eating behaviors of others in childhood. Let’s say your mother or father had a fear of a certain food; it’s likely that you’re going to develop it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-id="9acb5f2f-bb4a-40db-aba8-f3a99f61344d"&gt;However, there might be some biological factors behind cibophobia, too. Genetics and other biological factors may be behind our developing certain phobias. Still, too much is unknown for us to be able to say for certain that cibophobia can be genetic, but changes in brain chemistry might lead to us developing food phobias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3

My blood tests say that the levels are OK, but I still have all the symptoms. I received biological hormones, which helped a lot, but yams bind to the levothyroxine pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— S.P.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear S.P.:&lt;/strong&gt; The symptoms of low thyroid levels can be very nonspecific. Fatigue or weakness, intolerance of cold temperatures, and weight gain are common, but many conditions (anemia is a big one) can cause these as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In my general internal medicine practice, I see a lot of normal thyroid tests because so many conditions can resemble low thyroid levels. If the thyroid tests are normal, though, then it's very unlikely that the thyroid is the cause of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are a handful of exceptions, such as people who have normal T4 levels (T4, or thyroxine, is the mostly inactive precursor to T3, which is the most active form of the hormone) but are unable to convert T4 to T3, leading to symptoms of hypothyroidism with normal T4 levels. Unless the doctor checks their T3 levels, they can miss this diagnosis, which is uncommon but not rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;TSH, a hormone produced in the pituitary, can sometimes be mildly or not at all elevated because the normal T4 levels fool the pituitary into "thinking" that the thyroid levels are normal. The correct treatment is T3, usually given with T4, but T3 must be given twice daily. I don't recommend "natural" hormones made from pig thyroids because they do not contain the correct ratio of T3 to T4. There are precisely dosed bioidentical T3 and T4 preparations available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I do see that yams (technically, sweet potatoes) can block the absorption of thyroid hormones, but this is true only when eaten raw and in large quantities. So, most people do not need to worry about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In my opinion, you should get your T3, T4 and TSH levels checked. But if they are normal, you need to find out what else might be causing your symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I have been taking a fiber supplement successfully for a while, which is known to several of my doctors. A new doctor now advises that this well-known brand contains lead, and I should discontinue its use. She recommended a different supplement, which I have tried. Unfortunately, it does not work as well as my original brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Please clarify whether fiber supplements do in fact contain lead as I would prefer to continue using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— A.B.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear A.B.:&lt;/strong&gt; A 2024 report by an independent laboratory found tiny lead levels present in all the psyllium products they tested. Lead is found throughout the environment, and the average American ingests about 5 mcg of lead daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The supplement you mentioned contains about 1-2 mcg if taken at the maximum daily dose. The supplement your new doctor recommended has less. The United States Food and Drug Administration limit is 12.5 mcg/day based on a safety factor of 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In my opinion, the exceedingly small amount that is present in your brand does not justify using a product that doesn't work as well for you, even if has an even smaller amount. It is very unlikely that the amount of lead present in the supplement will cause you any health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A very similar news story was the source of some questions in October, when some protein powders and shakes were found to have small amounts of lead in them around the order of 1 mcg per serving, with a few brands as high as 8 mcg per serving.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2025 09:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQbGgyVmxVN2tyVzNGejRZS3U2MUdSSnpoNDBTYnRCOWh0Ny1NQWMzRTQwdHZaRWpjVWFCQlFMODdDdnIwdGFrNENFRDRiTEEydDdMazlVM1dBUi1aUzBRYVc1ZWt2U3pwbXUtdjNEQmVpYWNJdUI2OWdpZ0xORU9BdTFBOW1LWGkxbVBxNDJEbHBBdlZWbDF3UWdTc04zRnZYTkt1aWhseTh3eW5DS3J5ZmdndkJhVEV6RUMtSDVXeVRvdy01Z21R</guid></item><item><title>重磅肥胖药物是否会彻底改变成瘾治疗？ - Nature</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03911-x</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last April, neuroscientist Sue Grigson received an e-mail from a man detailing his years-long struggle to kick addiction — first to opioids, and then to the very medication meant to help him quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man had stumbled on research by Grigson, suggesting that certain anti-obesity medications could help to reduce rats’ addiction to drugs such as heroin and fentanyl. He decided to try quitting again, this time while taking semaglutide, the blockbuster GLP-1 drug better known as Ozempic. “That’s when he wrote to me,” says Grigson, who works at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey. “He said that he was drug- and alcohol-free for the first time in his adult life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03074-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_27707328.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why do obesity drugs seem to treat so many other ailments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like this have been spreading fast in the past few years, through online forums, weight-loss clinics and news headlines. They describe people taking diabetes and weight-loss drugs such as semaglutide (also marketed as Wegovy) and tirzepatide (sold as Mounjaro or Zepbound) who find themselves suddenly able to shake long-standing addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. And now, clinical data are starting to back them up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a team led by Christian Hendershot, a psychologist now at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, reported in a landmark randomized trial that weekly injections of semaglutide cut alcohol consumption&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; — a key demonstration that GLP-1 drugs can alter addictive behaviour in people with a substance-use disorder. More than a dozen randomized clinical studies testing GLP-1 drugs for addiction are now under way worldwide, with some results expected in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists, meanwhile, are working out how the weight-loss drugs suppress addiction by acting on hormone receptors in brain regions that control craving, reward and motivation. They are finding that GLP-1 therapies help to blunt urges for alcohol, opioids, nicotine and cocaine through some of the same brain pathways that also &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03766-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03766-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;quell hunger cues and overeating&lt;/a&gt;. “At the end of the day, the neurobiological system that is activated by rewarding substances — food, sex, drugs, rock and roll — it’s the same system,” says Roger McIntyre, a psychopharmacologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. And some researchers are testing whether, by influencing reward-related brain circuits, the drugs might help with dementia and depression as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01091-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_27075824.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Obesity drugs aren’t always forever. What happens when you quit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is still in its early stages, scientists warn. “We first need to find out if it’s efficacious and safe,” says W. Kyle Simmons, a neuroimaging specialist at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa, who is leading a GLP-1 trial for alcohol reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some researchers and physicians are excited. No truly new class of addiction medicine has won approval from regulators in decades, says Elisabet Jerlhag Holm, an addiction biologist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. If GLP-1 drugs prove effective in bigger trials, she says, “it’s a revolution”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Laboratory to limelight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took some years for the current buzz around GLP-1 drugs in addiction medicine to build. Researchers originally developed them to control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes by mimicking the hormone GLP-1. Soon it became clear that the drugs could &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-04505-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;curb appetite and promote weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, too. They act on hormone receptors located in the pancreas and gut — where they help to regulate blood sugar and signal fullness — but also in key regions of the brain that control reward and motivation, dialling down the urge for tasty, calorie-laden food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the early 2010s, Jerlhag Holm was wondering whether the drugs could blunt other urges. She published a trio of papers showing that they could dampen cravings in rats and mice hooked on alcohol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, nicotine&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Her team also showed&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that GLP-1 therapy could reduce animal behaviours that resemble relapse, which is when people return to drugs after a period of abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51762694.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51762694.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A man in a shirt standing in a doorway next to a no smoking sign, exhaling a large cloud of vapour." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51762694.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Some people report anecdotally that GLP-1 drugs are helping them to quit long-standing nicotine addictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet her findings barely registered among addiction researchers, she says, and pharmaceutical companies showed no interest either. “I was quite alone for a long time,” says Jerlhag Holm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lorenzo Leggio, a physician-scientist at the US National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, noticed the work. He had also been following clues that GLP-1 might influence addictive behaviour and, in 2015, joined forces with Jerlhag Holm to uncover the first evidence of a connection between the hormone and alcohol dependence in humans. The team found that a common variant of the GLP-1 receptor gene was linked to heavier drinking&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using post-mortem human brain tissue, Leggio’s lab later showed that people with alcohol-use disorder have elevated levels of GLP-1 receptors in key reward-related regions of the brain&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Leggio suspects that this reflects an adaptive response: alcohol dampens the body’s GLP-1 production, and so the brain boosts expression of the hormone’s receptors to preserve sensitivity to it in circuits that govern reward and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results, together with a growing number of animal studies, solidified GLP-1’s connection to addictive behaviour. Yet it was not until May 2023 that the story spilled into the public eye. &lt;i&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; magazine published an article about people taking semaglutide who said their urge to smoke or drink had faded. ‘Did Scientists Accidentally Invent an Anti-addiction Drug?’ it was headlined. “That was definitely a turning point,” says Leggio, who suddenly found himself getting calls from journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first few rigorous trials, however, had largely disappointing results. A 2022 study in Denmark, led by psychiatrist Anders Fink-Jensen at the University of Copenhagen, found that weekly treatment with exenatide — a ‘first-generation’ GLP-1 compound used since 2005 to treat diabetes but never approved for weight loss — did not substantially reduce the number of heavy drinking days in people diagnosed with alcohol dependence&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. A 2023 trial in Switzerland likewise found that dulaglutide, another older GLP-1 drug, did not help people to quit smoking&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR9" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03766-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51777838.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How obesity drugs quiet ‘food noise’ in the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other results suggested that the drugs might have an effect. In a trial&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR10" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; involving 20 people with opioid-use disorder, led by Grigson and psychologist Scott Bunce, also at Pennsylvania State University, treatment with liraglutide — another first-generation GLP-1 drug — reduced opioid craving by roughly 40%. And when Fink-Jensen’s team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at the brains of people taking exenatide in their clinical trial, they saw muted activity in reward-related regions when the participants viewed images of alcoholic drinks&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the first-generation drugs tested in these preliminary studies are much less potent than agents such as semaglutide or tirzepatide. These second-generation compounds bind more tightly to the GLP-1 receptor, stay active in the body for longer and have shown greater benefits across a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03074-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03074-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;range of health conditions&lt;/a&gt;. So, could these latest drugs change the behaviour of people struggling with substance misuse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blunting the buzz&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what researchers are now examining in a raft of clinical trials with hotly anticipated results. Fink-Jensen and his colleagues have already tested whether the high dose of semaglutide approved for weight loss can cut alcohol intake in 108 people with alcohol-use disorder and obesity, in a clinical trial that wrapped up earlier this year. He says the results should be published in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00404-9" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03911-x/d41586-025-03911-x_51069212.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Dozens of new obesity drugs are coming: these are the ones to watch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, meanwhile, Leggio and Simmons are each leading independent but coordinated randomized trials testing injected semaglutide in moderate-to-heavy drinkers who meet the diagnostic criteria for problematic alcohol use. Leggio’s trial will involve 52 people and test the high-dose Wegovy form of the drug, whereas Simmons’s trial, involving 80 people, is testing the lower-dose Ozempic, typically prescribed for diabetes. And psychologist Joseph Schacht at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora has been running his own alcohol trial with the oral version of semaglutide (marketed as Rybelsus). By coordinating their efforts, the three teams hope to tease apart how differences in dose and delivery affect outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schacht says that the pills, although less potent than injections, could be more appealing to people with alcohol addiction, many of whom also have a history of using injectable drugs such as fentanyl. “They can be gun-shy around needles, because that is a cue related to injection drug use,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all of these trials of semaglutide for alcohol dependence, the research teams are also using fMRI to capture before-and-after snapshots of the brain to show how the drug alters responses to alcohol-related prompts, such as drinks or photos. This could reveal whether and how the drug disrupts the brain’s drive for alcohol — the reward-seeking sense of ‘wanting’ that fuels addiction. The imaging results might also show brain activity patterns that are more common in people who benefit from GLP-1 therapy than in those who don’t. “It may give us a better understanding for whom the drug works best,” Simmons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Anatomy of reward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are already piecing together a picture of how GLP-1 drugs act on the brain’s reward system. They know from animal models that rewarding substances — alcohol, nicotine, opioids, food — activate similar neural circuitry. This links deep brain structures such as the ventral tegmental area, where neurons that synthesize the neurotransmitter dopamine originate, to the nucleus accumbens, where dopamine signals arrive and register as pleasure. Normally, every sip, puff or hit sends a jolt of rewarding dopamine through this circuit, teaching the brain to want more and reinforcing addictive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 receptors sit on neurons throughout this network and, when triggered, are thought to reduce the flow of dopamine and other chemical messages to make rewarding experiences feel less compelling. When drugs such as semaglutide mimic GLP-1, they blunt the dopamine response and the compulsion to repeat the addictive behaviour fades away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress responses come into play as well, animal studies show. When drugs activate GLP-1 receptors in brain regions such as the amygdala, they help to mute the surge of stress hormones that accompany anxiety, withdrawal and craving. This dual action — calming both the urge and the unease — could help to explain why the therapies seem to reduce not only consumption but also relapse, at least in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                      &lt;p&gt;A new influenza variant spreading across Japan may be behind the increase in early outbreaks this year, the Japan Institute for Health Security (JIHS) has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new strain, called “Subclade K” is a variant of the type A flu virus, which typically spreads around the beginning of the flu season, while type B tends to spread later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="jt_content_ad DisplayAd" id="div-gpt-ad-1499653692894-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the influenza patients JIHS examined since September, they found that 22 out of 23 samples — around 96% — were infected with the new strain.&lt;/p&gt;
