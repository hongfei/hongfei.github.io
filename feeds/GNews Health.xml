This was a smaller-scale study that combined two clinical trials into one because separately they were not able to enroll enough patients. Different rules for who could join each of the studies in each country may have skewed the results, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“REBOOT was a cleaner study in terms of protocol and inclusion criteria,” said Dr. Steven Pfau, professor of cardiovascular medicine and interventional cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Notably, REBOOT challenges over 40 years of standardized practice, which calls for patients admitted to the hospital for a heart attack to be started on beta blockers before or shortly after they are discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cardiologists’ methods for treating heart attacks and opening blockages in the coronary arteries in a timely fashion have improved drastically over the past 10-20 years, experts say. That's why, in an age of improved medical therapies and procedural interventions for heart attacks, such as better-performing coronary artery stents, it may be time to rethink the long-standing guidance on beta-blocker use, according to some experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Beta blockers were developed at a time before routine reperfusion therapy for acute heart attacks and the evolution of more potent medications, and care has really evolved,” said Fonarow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Pfau said that neither study makes a compelling case for beta blockers versus no beta blockers for this select group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“If beta blockers do have an effect, it is probably small, given the other therapies we have,” he said. “It fits the discussion for both studies that, with the way we currently practice, beta blockers potentially add very little to outcomes after a heart attack for patients with preserved heart function and no other pre-existing reason to be on a beta blocker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If patients can take beta blockers safely, they should keep using them for now, Fonarow advised. But he also called for more studies to understand which patients benefit the most from this type of medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Jennifer Miao is a board-certified cardiologist, critical care and interventional cardiology fellow at Yale School of Medicine/YNHH, and a fellow with the ABC News' Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:22:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPSlZlX0FaX3VWSWl0SU9sRXFjU2RGaElUTlVndDBaNS1MUVRJVVg2Q2lmZjQ3MTAzX3p5a29XWHZEdlpRUkNtaFhrdy1uemttajNneTVjdFFTYm9LTTNzVjZSTG03YUEwbFppZ1hyT2EzQ3JtY3BtaWwwY0ZLMV81MTREb1ZkY3Q5SDlKeXg2XzladHNVNl9GQU1OUWdkNjVJajlQS3N6dk52VEZi0gGyAUFVX3lxTE9LY21vVlF2SzY4cG9wZWNMM0NBTFFmSTEzX2xmQzJoaTdLd0FycjhVWDE1VUQwNmJlRWdJeWFfQTI3UWNqdjd5ZkhvelRqZHVCZC1xcURTNjhkTUhZemFTM2Z4QUJBeDRKdFNEMGlpZEloQ2tvdmVSMTBLelQyNVlyRnVPMTk2OURkNFl2cVQtQzhiNlhpb0FvSklLQm5kVzI2YThjMnRaeV9RYm9NU2tsX1E</guid></item><item><title>CVS和沃尔格林在科罗拉多州限制接种新冠疫苗- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2025/08/29/colorado-covid-vaccines-prescription-cvs-walgreens</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 03:32:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPYnNDb1RnR0lRbXpkVDlTOVBXMFBfaFZHOXVDYnFmaFRDUWFXb0NVNGNrQlR4ZWR3b3ZWdWZ3S0tudjczdFprVkVEODFUdmtpcEltWlpNZWhndVZNUGR5N1haZ2R2Y3E4YXFuZGpJMUZ0VEsybGtzVlh2MDBlRW10dlJKRFhMZTFGY09idDUzMWJnQnROVWVOREt0aWI</guid></item><item><title>我因为和狗睡觉而感染了致命的感染，使我毁容-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15036609/flesh-eating-bacteria-sepsis-dog-bite-reddit.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man who suffered a bite from his dog contracted the life-threatening infection &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-89706950-8449-11f0-afe1-ad8a3fe21a15"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; and has been left permanently disfigured.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man, from Australia, was asleep in his bed when his dog laid down next to him. Not knowing his dog was there, the anonymous man rolled over and accidentally punched his dog in the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Startled, the pet bit his owner on wrist.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though he thought nothing of the bite at first, he went to his local urgent care three days later after his arm became swollen and covered in red, coin-sized pustules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then was admitted to the hospital. Not long after that, his blood pressure dropped to 53/30, dangerously low compared to healthy pressure of 120/80. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low blood pressure means there is less oxygen in the blood, and if left untreated, the condition can cause vital organs like the heart and brain to die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors found the man was &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13857217/man-contracts-flesh-eating-disease-childhood-virus.html"&gt;suffering from necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, also known as 'flesh-eating disease,' a severe bacterial infection that spreads quickly and kills healthy tissues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the disease destroyed his tissues and infiltrated his bloodstream, it caused sepsis, a life-threatening overreaction to an infection that causes blood pressure to plummet and the immune system to attack healthy organs and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The low blood pressure deprives tissues and organs of oxygen, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13165721/sepsis-crisis-killer-infections-hospital.html"&gt;causing them to fail and die&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The man's dog, Scotty, is pictured here. Scotty still lives with his owner and has caused no further issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear what bacteria exactly caused the infection, but doctors told the man it 'lives on human skin.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1,000 species of bacteria are naturally found on human skin and are generally harmless. The most common are Staphylococcus aureus (staph) and Streptococcus pyogenes (strep), which live inside the nose and on the skin of between 10 and 30 percent of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treating the man estimated there was just a one in 10,000 chance the bacteria would enter his bloodstream through an opening like a dog bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man wrote in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1mnxjeu/i_survived_necrotising_fasciitis_and_septic_shock/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt;: '[Doctors] told me that it was almost certainly not from his mouth but from my skin.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis, in which bacteria eats at skin, muscle and tissue until they shrivel up and die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It kills about one in five patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'I knew as soon as I woke up and looked at my arm that I was in a lot of trouble. I'm lucky I woke up in time, if I'd stayed asleep I wouldn't be here.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His arm had turned 'bright red' and tripled in size. It was also covered in coin-sized pustules. Despite the alarming appearance, he only had minimal pain that felt like a sunburn, though he was also dizzy and nauseous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria entering the man's bloodstream triggered a whole-body immune reaction, called sepsis, which affects 350,000 Americans every year and kills one every 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The blurred image shows the man's arm with skin torn away and his tendons showing due to the flesh-eating bacteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sepsis is usually treated with antibiotics for the underlying infection and medications called vasopressors, which divert blood flow back to vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this takes blood from 'non-vital' areas like limbs, increasing the risk of tissue death and amputations. This is why the man's blood pressure dropped dangerously low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being rushed into surgery, doctors managed to save his arm, 'although it was close going,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the infection didn't reach the bone, in the past four years, he's undergone 20 surgeries to remove dead tissue, graft skin from other parts of his body on to the affected arm and reconstruct his hip and Achilles tendon due to long-term damage from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said his arm has regained 'about 90 percent function,' but he needs regular monitoring due to lasting organ damage from the sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'We're still trying to quantify exactly how bad the damage is, but at this stage I'm pretty optimistic. My final liver scan is this Friday, my kidneys appear to be ok, heart only took minor damage, brain is still a question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm slower than I was, and struggling with memory a bit, but I'm still pretty medicated.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The man said he has had 20 surgeries to repair the damage. The above images show his progress from several years ago (left) and what the arm looks like now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said his treatment totaled $500,000 AUD ($325,000 USD), but because Australia has universal healthcare, he only paid about $1,000 AUD ($650 USD). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the dog bite triggered the cascade of events, the man doesn't blame his pup, Scotty, and still has him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'He's kept me company, and sane, through all of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Animals don't intend to hurt people, they just sometimes do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He urged people who suffer deep wounds like his to 'immediately clean, disinfect and dress it once you've stemmed the bleeding.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Get your backside to a medical professional ASAP. I waited a day because my regular doctor was booked out for the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I should have gone straight to an [emergency department] or urgent care and gotten antibiotics.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 03:10:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOdXFhNEpDQlF6NzFjUkRXZmdray1GaGs1RDFpMXJZRnR2UXZQUU9YSG5NMEhfLVpiOEVrSkhwZGxEVC1wX2xqalcxM1lJcHpKX0dWNHdOWUJQWjBmSldYcll2aThtWHNSekJDZXM4VG9zRXJTSTN4U05oekwzV21SR1liRWRaTU5hWHdtSGpuOF9OakdEQVAtVGNqQTBKemQ1QmpV0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1vT0ZNQlQ0ZUUwblBXUk9fMGRUSlFXZnVDbm1KSWJVTzVYTjVQa2ZBcnJkYkxYcXFld1pzN2x4SzI4dzRNZm1RenZHNnRyYnd3SEFzNUFmeWFlaFBLelJ5VTFlY1YtSWloMk1jVnI0ZFBGQ2Q1Y0pRdE4yNHVVSTBaeENMUTFxTzBaV2dDNmIyd3BFWlJzWUlyQ3N0U0RJZU56ODM4S3Q5Vg</guid></item><item><title>我和狗睡觉感染了感染，导致我毁容-《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15036609/flesh-eating-bacteria-sepsis-dog-bite-reddit.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man who suffered a bite from his dog contracted the life-threatening infection &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-89706950-8449-11f0-afe1-ad8a3fe21a15"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; and has been left permanently disfigured.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man, from Australia, was asleep in his bed when his dog laid down next to him.

Despite the alarming appearance, he only had minimal pain that felt like a sunburn, though he was also dizzy and nauseous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria entering the man's bloodstream triggered a whole-body immune reaction, called sepsis, which affects 350,000 Americans every year and kills one every 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The blurred image shows the man's arm with skin torn away and his tendons showing due to the flesh-eating bacteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sepsis is usually treated with antibiotics for the underlying infection and medications called vasopressors, which divert blood flow back to vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this takes blood from 'non-vital' areas like limbs, increasing the risk of tissue death and amputations. This is why the man's blood pressure dropped dangerously low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being rushed into surgery, doctors managed to save his arm, 'although it was close going,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the infection didn't reach the bone, in the past four years, he's undergone 20 surgeries to remove dead tissue, graft skin from other parts of his body on to the affected arm and reconstruct his hip and Achilles tendon due to long-term damage from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said his arm has regained 'about 90 percent function,' but he needs regular monitoring due to lasting organ damage from the sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'We're still trying to quantify exactly how bad the damage is, but at this stage I'm pretty optimistic. My final liver scan is this Friday, my kidneys appear to be ok, heart only took minor damage, brain is still a question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm slower than I was, and struggling with memory a bit, but I'm still pretty medicated.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The man said he has had 20 surgeries to repair the damage. The above images show his progress from several years ago (left) and what the arm looks like now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said his treatment totaled $500,000 AUD ($325,000 USD), but because Australia has universal healthcare, he only paid about $1,000 AUD ($650 USD). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the dog bite triggered the cascade of events, the man doesn't blame his pup, Scotty, and still has him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'He's kept me company, and sane, through all of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Animals don't intend to hurt people, they just sometimes do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He urged people who suffer deep wounds like his to 'immediately clean, disinfect and dress it once you've stemmed the bleeding.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Get your backside to a medical professional ASAP. I waited a day because my regular doctor was booked out for the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I should have gone straight to an [emergency department] or urgent care and gotten antibiotics.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 03:10:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOdXFhNEpDQlF6NzFjUkRXZmdray1GaGs1RDFpMXJZRnR2UXZQUU9YSG5NMEhfLVpiOEVrSkhwZGxEVC1wX2xqalcxM1lJcHpKX0dWNHdOWUJQWjBmSldYcll2aThtWHNSekJDZXM4VG9zRXJTSTN4U05oekwzV21SR1liRWRaTU5hWHdtSGpuOF9OakdEQVAtVGNqQTBKemQ1QmpV</guid></item><item><title>食肉细菌：科学家说，由于气候变化，导致坏死性筋膜炎的创伤弧菌病例增加-费城6abc</title><link>https://6abc.com/post/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-cases-cause-necrotizing-fasciitis-rising-due-climate-change-scientists-say/17688785/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;&lt;span class="oyrPY qlwaB AGxeB  "&gt;NEW ORLEANS -- &lt;/span&gt;Just southwest of New Orleans, in a tranquil fishing village on the Louisiana bayou, Linard Lyons spent the morning on his 19-foot boat, preparing crab traps for his grandchildren just like he had done thousands of times before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This time, he noticed a tiny scratch on his leg - a scratch that nearly cost him his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Lyons went about his day but woke up the following morning feeling "delusional." Feverish and vomiting, he initially thought he had just contracted a stomach bug, but then discovered a series of blackening sores spreading across his left leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In what turned out to be a life-saving move, he went straight to his family doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Lyons tells CNN his doctor immediately knew "exactly what it was" and sent him straight to the emergency room. In the "matter of maybe an hour," Lyons found himself in the hospital's operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That small scratch on Lyons' leg became the entryway for Vibrio vulnificus, also known as flesh-eating bacteria. Those black sores on his leg signified necrotizing fasciitis, which "affects the tissue under your skin," according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These potentially deadly bacteria are naturally found and thrive in coastal waters during the warmer months, especially in brackish waters, where fresh water meets the sea, according to the US Centers for Disease and Control Prevention. Once largely confined to the Gulf Coast, cases have surged along the East Coast, with an 800% increase from 1988 to 2018, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;50/50 chance of survival&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Do I have permission to do what I need to do to save your life?" Lyons' doctor asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These were the last words Lyons recalled hearing before surgery. He immediately understood the seriousness of the situation and realized his leg may have to be amputated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I was given a 50/50 chance of coming out of the hospital alive at that point," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;His surgeons were able to both cut away the infection and save Lyons' leg. After three days in the intensive care unit, three weeks in the hospital and various antibiotics, he was "cleared of the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It has been more than three months since he contracted the flesh-eating bacteria, yet his recovery is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Recovery has not been comfortable for Lyons, who has diabetes; he describes it as a "misery." Yet, he remains hopeful that a skin graft will be the final step in getting his leg back to "normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vibrio vulnificus should generally not pose a fatal risk to the average person, Mississippi's State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney tells CNN. People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of contracting an infection, Edney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you plan to be in coastal water, assume it is contaminated with Vibrio and avoid the water if you have "cuts or wounds that could be potentially infected," according to Edney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, Vibrio infection doesn't occur only through wound-to-water contact. It can also stem from consuming certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;The tiny print on the menu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"CONSUMING RAW OR UNDERCOOKED MEATS, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, SHELLFISH OR EGGS MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This warning, often found in small print at the bottom of restaurant menus, may look familiar. In Louisiana, this specific warning must be "clearly visible" at all establishments that sell or serve raw oysters - with few exceptions - according to the Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vibriosis can also be contracted by eating raw or undercooked shellfish. Most often it's a less serious infection from a different type of the bacteria, causing only stomach discomfort, but can occasionally find its way into the bloodstream, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Oysters get their food by filtering out sea water. When that water is ripe with bacteria, a single oyster could contain as many as a million Vibrio vulnificus cells, according to Dr. Jim Oliver, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;The broader risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Though it's rare, "many people with Vibrio vulnificus infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill," according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Louisiana was one of the first states to bring attention to this infection this season after it saw a spike in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;By the end of July, officials reported 17 hospitalizations and four deaths among Louisiana residents, more than double what they typically see. At least three more cases were reported in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This potentially deadly bacteria is not just unique to the Gulf states and is being found farther north as water temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Massachusetts Department of Public Health identified an "extremely rare" case of Vibrio vulnificus from a resident exposed to coastal water near Martha's Vineyard. So far this year, Massachusetts has confirmed 71 cases, with a 30% hospitalization rate and no deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Massachusetts, however, is not the only East Coast state reporting increased cases. Virginia Department of Health officials say cases of vibriosis across its residents have been "increasing over the last ten years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cases in North Carolina have increased 620% over the past 10 years, and New York's have more than tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scientists link this trend to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Climate change fuels the spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The oceans are getting warmer and sea level is rising because of human-caused climate change, and scientists warn these factors are increasing the risk of Vibrio infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Oliver, the UNC Charlotte professor, added that melting glaciers are lowering ocean salinity - another factor that increases the threat. "Open sea salt water has too high of a salinity rate for Vibrio vulnificus," he explained. But when fresh water dilutes it, the "conditions become more favorable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As the climate warms, more bacteria stays alive through the winter, which worsens outbreaks in the summer because we're starting from an already elevated level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Rachel Noble, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied Vibrio since the early 2000s, told CNN the increased prevalence of this potentially deadly bacterium is being "repeated globally," indicating a "complexity of issues related to climate change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This isn't going to be the only pathogen that increases in the face of climate change," Noble said. "It's just one example, but one we can really learn from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Awareness saves lives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Lyons is encouraging others to learn about Vibrio and hopes local leaders will spread awareness by posting additional signage to warn both residents and visitors. Any wounds, even a tiny scratch, should be thoroughly washed with soap and clean running water, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I hope my story helps people understand what to look out for," Lyons said. It might even "save a life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you develop symptoms, "seek help immediately and get to the emergency room," Lyons urges. "That's the best thing. Just go there and hopefully you'll see someone who will recognize it for what it is, because a misdiagnosis can be a death sentence. It really can be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;(The-CNN-Wire &amp;amp; 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

&lt;p&gt;The McHenry County Department of Health is investigating after two people and an animal were exposed to a rabid bad in northwest suburban Cary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two individuals and animal were exposed on Thursday, marking the county's first case of human exposure this year, the Department of Health said in a Facebook post. The two people were receiving "post-exposure treatment," officials said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/diseases/rabies.html?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExanVpUkNKbFY1UmJGTDV4UAEeQRSB_0H7HZguGEolKWWPs9jfpyM4ybeqP6UgPrN3UAOs0lW1sCIxVmr2sPY_aem_o_3zGGZh-5aUi3JQXKwpXg"&gt;the Illinois Department of Public Health,&lt;/a&gt; most recent cases of human rabies in the U.S. have been caused by rabid bats. While most bats don't have rabies, the following signs could indicate a bat is more likely to be infected than others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seen during the day&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Found in a place where bats usually aren't present (For example - a room in your home, on your lawn)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unable to fly &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People usually know when they have been bitten by a bat, but that's not always the case. According to IDPH, bats have very small teeth - and the marks they make aren't always easy to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in close proximity to a bat and aren't sure you've been exposed, you're encouraged to call your doctor or local health department to determine whether that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State officials recommend the following steps to protect yourself, other people and animals from rabies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not feed, touch or adopt wild animals or stray dogs or cats&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vaccinated pets serve as a buffer between rabid wildlife and humans, so be sure dogs and cats are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Do not allow pets to roam free&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Do not attract wild animals to your home or yard. Store bird seed or other animal feed in containers with tight-fitting lids. Feed pets indoors. Make sure garbage cans are tightly capped. Board up any openings to your attic, basement, porch or garage. Cap chimneys with screens&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encourage children to immediately tell an adult if they are bitten or scratched by an animal. Teach children not to approach or to touch any animal they do not know&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Report all animal bites to local animal control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Stanford Medicine and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2838257?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=082925" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adult-adhd-diagnosis-children-genetics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy," explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with "behavioral intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm," Howard said. "It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turn &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/parents-struggle-to-find-adhd-medication-shortage/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;to medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adhd-drugs-teens-misuse-adderall-ritalin-stimulants-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;prescribed drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits," Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/08/adhd-preschoolers.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment," the researchers concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication," Howard said. "...But there is actually a lot more than that. And we want to give kids the opportunity to use these other strategies first, and then if they need medication, it can be incredibly helpful for a lot of kids."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 68-year-old, who &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/10/fox-news-host-john-roberts-dead-ai-grok-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;refuted AI reports of his death&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, revealed he’s currently battling a serious bout of the mosquito-borne illness that the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;warns can be life-threatening&lt;/a&gt; “if not quickly diagnosed and appropriately treated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts said he was diagnosed with the potentially fatal disease on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had been hurting from the top of my head to the tip of my toes. Literally everywhere,” he told People. “I was also &lt;a href="https://people.com/fox-news-john-roberts-hospitalized-with-severe-malaria-exclusive-11799757" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;beset with uncontrolled shivering&lt;/a&gt; all during my show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/america-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“America Reports”&lt;/a&gt; host said he initially thought the symptoms he experienced were “just muscle cramps and aches” until he began shivering. That’s when he began believing he had the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a visit to the rheumatologist, who determined his platelets and white blood cells were both low, he rushed to the emergency room, where he officially received his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought, ‘Of course you have malaria … You never do anything in small measures,’” Roberts said. “But I was a little scared. Malaria can be deadly if left unchecked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know exactly how ‘severe’ it was from a medical classification, but it sure felt severe,” he added. “I have never felt that sick in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;While thanking Fox News correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/trace-gallagher" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Trace Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; for filling in for him on air, Roberts said on social media he was “the only person in the hospital with malaria. In fact, one of my doctors said I’m the first case he has ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2,000 cases of malaria diagnosed every year in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

Foshan city has been identified as the epicentre of the outbreak, prompting containment steps that some compare to early COVID-era measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people in China have been infected, the report said. Chikungunya is spread through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes in warm, humid climates, but not through person-to-person contact. While rarely fatal, the illness can cause intense joint pain lasting weeks, months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has urged travellers to protect themselves by using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothing, avoiding mosquito breeding sites, and staying in screened or air-conditioned accommodations. Two vaccines against chikungunya have recently been approved for use in the United States, but pregnant women - particularly those nearing delivery - are advised to reconsider travel as the virus can, in rare cases, be transmitted during childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, an estimated 35 million people contract chikungunya each year, though annual deaths are relatively low at around 3,700. In the US, 46 travel-related cases have been reported so far in 2025, compared with nearly 200 in 2024. No locally transmitted cases have been recorded in the country since 2019, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults, newborns, and people with chronic health conditions remain at greater risk of severe or long-term complications from the illness, the agency added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 23:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>简历和沃尔格林根据一些州指南的要求限制获得新冠疫苗的机会- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cvs-walgreens-limit-access-covid-vaccines-required-state-guidelines/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CVS and Walgreens are now requiring a prescription or are not offering COVID-19 vaccines in some states as the companies attempt to follow state guidelines that require approvals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-fda-revokes-pfizer-emergency-authorization/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;has approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax for all seniors, but only for younger adults and children with health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, CVS said the pharmacy chain cannot vaccinate those even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico due to state laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on the current regulatory environment," CVS said it's offering COVID-19 vaccinations in the following states: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS said the list of states offering COVID-19 vaccines without a prescription may change at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other 16 states, CVS said it can administer a COVID-19 vaccination, depending on the patient's age, with an authorized prescriber's prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Walgreens said, "With the recent FDA approval of the 2025–2026 COVID-19 vaccine, Walgreens is prepared to offer the vaccine in states where we are able to do so." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA's decision to end emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for children under 5 will limit vaccine choices for younger children, leaving the Moderna vaccine as the only vaccine available for those 6 months to 4 years old with at least one health condition. Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics released &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that, for the first time in 30 years, differ from U.S. government advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585?_gl=1*x6sa7g*_ga*NzAzODcyMjAyLjE3NTU2MDg3MzY.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTU2MDg3MzYkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTU2MDg3NjIkajM0JGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*NTkzNjQ2NDkxLjE3NTU2MDg3NTM.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTU2MDg3NTQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTU2MDg3NjIkajUyJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the guidance&lt;/a&gt; published Aug. 19, the AAP said it's "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. However, the CDC doesn't recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children of any age, but instead says &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-kids-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;kids may get the shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in consultation with a physician.&lt;/p&gt;

That applies to those over 65, a CVS spokeswoman wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/health/covid-vaccination-questions-mkkumlfq" target="_blank"&gt;authorized three updated COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for people 65 and over as well as those with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, asthma and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other people can get the vaccine after consulting with their doctors, according to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;social media post&lt;/a&gt; from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what that would entail for healthy adults under the age of 65 and children as respiratory virus season looms. September and October are the prime time for people to receive COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19. That panel usually makes recommendations on vaccines for the general public and can be pivotal in whether health insurance companies pay for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/cdc-monarez-fired-trump-kennedy-vaccines-science-l07051" target="_blank"&gt;current upheaval at the CDC&lt;/a&gt; following the firing of its latest director could also have an impact. Health professionals expressed concerns in June when Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, fired all members of the ACIP and replaced them with appointees who have also publicly expressed skeptical views of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eve Meltzer Krief, a pediatrician at Allied Physician Group’s Huntington Village Pediatrics, said she has not received any information about changes to the way vaccines are delivered to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we are waiting to see if insurance companies will cover the vaccine according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidance recommending children 6 months to 2 years get the vaccine," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meltzer Krief said documenting high-risk conditions such as asthma will be "cumbersome and not efficient particularly at this late date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nidhin Mohan, owner and supervising pharmacist at New Island Pharmacy in Deer Park, said he has not yet heard anything about the need for prescriptions or other limitations but doesn’t expect any issues with supply since he can order directly from Pfizer and other pharmaceutical firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walgreens, the nation's second largest pharmacy chain, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

That applies to those over 65, a CVS spokeswoman wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/health/covid-vaccination-questions-mkkumlfq" target="_blank"&gt;authorized three updated COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for people 65 and over as well as those with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, asthma and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other people can get the vaccine after consulting with their doctors, according to a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;social media post&lt;/a&gt; from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what that would entail for healthy adults under the age of 65 and children as respiratory virus season looms. September and October are the prime time for people to receive COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to meet Sept. 18-19. That panel usually makes recommendations on vaccines for the general public and can be pivotal in whether health insurance companies pay for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/cdc-monarez-fired-trump-kennedy-vaccines-science-l07051" target="_blank"&gt;current upheaval at the CDC&lt;/a&gt; following the firing of its latest director could also have an impact. Health professionals expressed concerns in June when Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, fired all members of the ACIP and replaced them with appointees who have also publicly expressed skeptical views of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eve Meltzer Krief, a pediatrician at Allied Physician Group’s Huntington Village Pediatrics, said she has not received any information about changes to the way vaccines are delivered to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we are waiting to see if insurance companies will cover the vaccine according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidance recommending children 6 months to 2 years get the vaccine," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meltzer Krief said documenting high-risk conditions such as asthma will be "cumbersome and not efficient particularly at this late date."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nidhin Mohan, owner and supervising pharmacist at New Island Pharmacy in Deer Park, said he has not yet heard anything about the need for prescriptions or other limitations but doesn’t expect any issues with supply since he can order directly from Pfizer and other pharmaceutical firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walgreens, the nation's second largest pharmacy chain, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

GTP provides essential energy for cleaning up dead cells, with a lack of the compound previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-022-00717-x"&gt;being linked&lt;/a&gt; to the development of Alzheimer's in aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171918" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171918" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower.jpg" alt="GTP graphical abstract" class="wp-image-171918 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower-600x297.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171918" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;GTP is closely related to autophagy, the natural recycling of dead cells.

The compounds also reversed damage associated with age in brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While GTP has previously been linked with neurodegeneration, the study reveals how levels can drop over time, especially when Alzheimer's is involved. The researchers speculate that the combination of epigallocatechin gallate and nicotinamide may return GTP to levels found in younger cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights GTP as a previously underappreciated energy source driving vital brain functions," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/08/06/uc-irvine-researchers-find-combination-of-natural-compounds-for-brain-cleaning/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-more-green-tea-each-day-cuts-risk-of-dementia-brain-lesions"&gt;a separate study&lt;/a&gt; linked green tea with fewer white matter lesions in the brain, and in turn a lower dementia risk, though the research didn't prove direct cause and effect. Nicotinamide &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1178646918776658"&gt;has also been implicated&lt;/a&gt; in protecting neurons from the effects of stroke and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this research, we know that GTP might be part of the reason why – and that epigallocatechin gallate and nicotinamide could make a critical difference together. It's going to take some time to turn this into a treatment, and it's important to note that this has only been tested in mouse cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"&gt;in vitro&lt;/a&gt;, but the results are encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As people age, their brains show a decline in neuronal energy levels, which limits the ability to remove unwanted proteins and damaged components," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/08/06/uc-irvine-researchers-find-combination-of-natural-compounds-for-brain-cleaning/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01786-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — Two siblings at Klein Cain High School have been diagnosed with active tuberculosis, prompting Harris County Public Health officials to conduct contact tracing. Klein ISD is also notifying potentially affected families and staff members.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the district was alerted about the cases by Harris County Public Health, they sent targeted notifications to a small group of students and staff who may have had prolonged close contact with an infected student. Klein ISD also sent general notifications to all Klein Cain families and staff.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affected students are currently receiving medical care and are not on campus. They will not be permitted to return until cleared by a physician or Harris County Public Health in accordance with state health regulations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts say tuberculosis is not transmitted through casual contact, such as walking past someone in a hallway. The disease typically requires prolonged, close contact in an enclosed setting to be transmitted. Harris County Public Health officials are conducting official contact tracing to identify anyone who may have had such exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"TB is treatable and curable with medication," the district emphasized in letters sent to families.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein Cain High School contacted specific students and staff members who shared classes with one of the infected students during the potentially contagious period. Families who were not contacted directly by the school have not been referred to Harris County Public Health as potential close contacts, though they may still be contacted if identified during the ongoing contact tracing process.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district noted that, due to privacy laws, it cannot disclose any information that could potentially identify the students. School officials requested that the community respect the privacy of the students and their family.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents with questions about potential exposure can contact their child's healthcare provider, visit the Harris County Public Health Tuberculosis Information site, or contact the county's TB Program at (832) 927-7575 during business hours or via email at &lt;a href="mailto:Epidemiology_Program@phs.hctx.net"&gt;Epidemiology_Program@phs.hctx.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families with questions about why they received notification letters can contact Klein Cain High School at (832) 375-8503.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

For years, the dependable ways to check patients for Alzheimer’s disease have been PET scans or spinal taps, no blood tests involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both can be effective. Both can also be expensive, invasive, or hard to get. That leaves many people waiting, worrying, and bouncing between appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new blood test aims to change that first step in care. It looks for the same biological signals that define Alzheimer’s disease and turns them into a single score – how likely it is that Alzheimer’s biology is present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough gives doctors a faster, simpler way to decide what should happen next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-blood-test-is-huge"&gt;Alzheimer’s blood test is huge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with early memory concerns start in primary care. Those clinics are busy and don’t have advanced imaging on hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reliable blood test would help sort patients sooner. Some could be &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/targeting-the-gut-might-be-key-in-preventing-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;referred to a specialist&lt;/a&gt; right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others could be monitored while doctors check for sleep issues, depression, thyroid problems, medication effects, or other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/traffic-related-air-pollution-might-increase-alzheimers-risk/"&gt;common causes&lt;/a&gt; of cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of triage saves time, cuts costs, and reduces unnecessary procedures. It also helps families move from uncertainty to a plan. Not months from now, but much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s has two key features in the brain: abnormal amyloid and tau proteins. The new blood test examines a form of tau called p-tau217 and the ratio of two amyloid fragments: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3716832/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aβ42 to Aβ40&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these numbers capture the core biology doctors care about. The result is a probability score that indicates how closely a person’s blood pattern matches Alzheimer’s changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using both markers strengthens the signal. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-024-03084-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;P-tau217&lt;/a&gt; tracks Alzheimer’s-type changes, and the amyloid ratio helps keep false positives in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, the result becomes clearer – either likely Alzheimer’s biology or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-blood-for-alzheimer-s-anywhere"&gt;Testing blood for Alzheimer’s anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see how the test would perform in everyday practice – not just in labs – researchers enrolled more than a thousand people in Sweden who came in with memory or thinking concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some were evaluated in primary care. Others were seen in specialty memory clinics. Everyone received the usual clinical evaluations provided in those settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples were handled the way a hospital lab would: in batches, on a set schedule. That detail matters because it tests reliability under normal conditions, not just under perfect, hands-on supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comparing-test-methods"&gt;Comparing test methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In straightforward terms, the blood test matched more definitive &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;measures of Alzheimer’s biology&lt;/a&gt; approximately nine times out of ten. Its performance held up in both primary care and specialty clinics, which is exactly where it needs to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primary care doctors’ accuracy in identifying Alzheimer’s disease was 61 percent, while specialist physicians were correct 73 percent of the time,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lund University&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Sebastian Palmqvist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This underscores the lack of good, cost-effective diagnostic tools, particularly in primary care, and indicates the potential improvement in diagnosis with the adoption of this blood test in healthcare settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fixed-thresholds-were-used"&gt;Fixed thresholds were used&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team set the Alzheimer’s blood test thresholds ahead of time and kept them fixed. That’s how a real diagnostic would be used in practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No tuning after reviewing the results. No custom cutoffs for each clinic. A fixed cutoff increases the chance that the same test will work the same way in other places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach adds confidence for doctors who &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-may-not-be-brain-disorder-important-data-was-fabricated/"&gt;need predictable tools&lt;/a&gt;. Consistency across settings is the difference between a research project and something a health system can actually roll out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When standard evaluations were used alone, clinicians did well. With blood test information added, decisions became more precise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A negative result in someone with mild, vague memory complaints gives doctors support to forgo invasive tests and monitor for changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-disruptions-could-signal-the-onset-of-alzheimers/"&gt;symptoms progress&lt;/a&gt; to mild cognitive impairment or dementia, a positive result supports referrals for confirmatory testing and, when appropriate, treatments that target Alzheimer’s biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood test does not replace PET scans or spinal fluid analysis. It helps focus those tools where they are most useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-public-should-know"&gt;What the public should know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a casual screening for people without symptoms. It’s a first-line tool when memory concerns are real and doctors need to decide what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used appropriately, it can shorten the path to answers for those who need a deeper look and spare others from procedures they don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also fits into normal workflows. A routine draw, a lab run on schedule, and a clear, interpretable score. That kind of practicality is what busy clinics need to act quickly and confidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The test is already available in the USA and is likely to become available in many other countries soon,” says senior researcher &lt;a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/oskar-hansson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oskar Hansson&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Lund University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initially, it will mainly be used in specialist memory clinics, and it may take approximately one to two years to implement guidelines and training in primary care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As availability grows, expect specialist clinics to lead the way. Primary care will follow as training, protocols, and reimbursement catch up. That staged rollout is typical when new diagnostics enter real-world care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-alzheimer-s-blood-tests"&gt;What’s next for Alzheimer’s blood tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, this new blood test that reads the biology of Alzheimer’s gives primary care doctors something they’ve never really had: a quick, evidence-based signal that is correct 90 percent of the time to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;guide next steps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won’t cure the disease. It will bring clearer direction, earlier in the process, for the people who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families, that means fewer dead ends and faster referrals when appropriate. For clinicians, it means a practical tool that strengthens decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For health systems, it means aiming advanced testing where it can make the biggest difference. That’s progress measured not just in lab values, but in how care actually feels – faster, calmer, and more to the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821669?resultclick=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

There are also some &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carotenoids-skin-health-study-11791322" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carotenoids with provitamin A activity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;carotenoids with provitamin A activity&lt;/a&gt;—meaning they get converted to vitamin A in your body. Vitamin A functions as an antioxidant, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, there’s evidence that &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A plays a role in cancer prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;vitamin A plays a role in cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt;. But how much is enough? And can too much be, well, too much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers wanted to know, too, so they conducted a hospital-based case-control study with Vietnamese participants. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers recruited participants from four major university hospitals in Vietnam. There were two groups of participants. One group was made up of over 3,700 cancer patients; the other was almost 3,000 control patients who did not have cancer, but were admitted to the hospital for other reasons. The cancer group included patients with esophageal, stomach, colon, rectal, lung, breast and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic information was gathered, as was dietary information using a food frequency questionnaire. From this info, participants’ dietary intake of vitamin A was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After running several statistical analyses, including adjusting for confounding factors, like sex, age and BMI, researchers found a U-shaped association between vitamin A intake and cancer. This means that both the lowest and highest intakes of vitamin A were associated with an increase in cancer risk. The reference vitamin A intake was 85.3-104 mcg/day; this reference marks the average intake for the control group, which had no cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancers that were most strongly associated with vitamin A were esophageal, breast, rectum and stomach—but not colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does have several limitations, starting with the potential for recall bias for the food frequency questionnaire—because, let’s face it, most of us can’t remember what we ate yesterday, let alone try to estimate how much of certain foods we eat on a regular basis. Also, because this was a hospital-based study, it might not be generalizable to other populations, nor can we be certain it applies to other ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most things in life, more is not necessarily better when it comes to vitamin A. But you also need to make sure you’re getting enough of this vitamin, because when you hit the sweet spot with it, it’s a nutritional powerhouse. These study authors do not provide an amount they recommend; they only provide the reference intake amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health, the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended vitamin A intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;recommended vitamin A intake&lt;/a&gt; shifts based on your age and sex. And since you can get vitamin A from so many sources, recommendations are given in &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-retinol-11745693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:retinol activity equivalents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;retinol activity equivalents&lt;/a&gt; (RAE), which can be translated to certain amounts of beta carotene, retinol and other forms of vitamin A. Here’s how the recommendations break down for adults:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-a-than-carrot-11690733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Foods rich in vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Foods rich in vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; include carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, spinach, tuna and beef liver. We love that it’s fun to get creative with these ingredients, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8064194/sheet-pan-carrots-chickpeas-with-tahini/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sheet-Pan Carrots &amp;amp; Chickpeas with Tahini;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sheet-Pan Carrots &amp;amp; Chickpeas with Tahini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/pumpkin-trifle-8730631" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pumpkin Trifle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pumpkin Trifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tuna-nicoise-melt-11784480" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tuna Niçoise Melt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tuna Niçoise Melt&lt;/a&gt;. And the good news is that most Americans are getting enough vitamin A in their diets, so you may find that you’re already in good shape when it comes to this nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, vitamin A isn’t the only important nutrient for cancer prevention, nor is diet the only area that needs attention. And since &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer rates are on the rise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer rates are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, including in young people, now is the time to start prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society suggests that the major areas of concern regarding cancer risk that we have control over include diet, physical activity, tobacco use and alcohol intake. Regarding diet, an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-an-anti-inflammatory-diet-8764103" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory eating pattern;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory eating pattern&lt;/a&gt; is recommended, as it’s loaded with nutrient-dense foods, like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in regular physical activity can also reduce your cancer risk, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-reduce-risk-breast-cancer-8725727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including for breast cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;including for breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And more and more evidence is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stacking up against alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stacking up against alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that too much and too little vitamin A may raise your risk of several types of cancer. If you’re unsure whether you’re getting the right amount of this essential vitamin, make an appointment to talk with a registered dietitian or seek out a health care professional for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to take a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-avoid-to-prevent-cancer-11758515" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whole-health approach to cancer prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;whole-health approach to cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-to-make-first-8770807" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating lots of anti-inflammatory foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating lots of anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt;, moving your body more often, getting plenty of quality sleep, managing your stressors, limiting or avoiding alcohol and avoiding tobacco products. If this list overwhelms you, choose one area to start working on and be consistent with it. Before long, you’ll realize the other areas come easier. And while there’s no guarantee you’ll prevent cancer with this strategy, if you do get it, you’ll be stronger and better able to handle what it throws at you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-a-cancer-study-11800558" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:47:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1uaEFFMzYtMTFKQ0Y2a2Y5cWpPTzAza1RSS3pnR2VKSHN0WE5odzFkaEhWVEY4U05oTW8xVXhEbmFTb0hZNkQxUGw4VWJfaFN5LTJXSERaTGMxRVZEbnZCQ21yd0lUMk80ekpOZktn</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎病例，美国住院率上升，但仍低于去年- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-cases-hospitalizations-ticking-us-remain-lower-year/story?id=125016283</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;COVID-19 cases are ticking up in the U.S. as children head back to school and the country prepares to enter the colder weather months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For the week ending Aug. 9, the COVID hospitalization rate was 1.7 per 100,000, double the rate from two months ago, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/covid-net/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, for the week ending Aug. 23, 11.2% of weekly tests came back positive for COVID, up from 3.3% the prior two months, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_testpositivity_00" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Despite the increases, metrics remain much lower than in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hospitalization rates are about three times lower than at the same time last year and the percentage of weekly tests coming pack positive is about two times lower compared to the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, over the past two months, roughly 200 Americans have been dying from COVID every week, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There has been confusion over who may be able to receive a COVID vaccine after the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/fda-approves-updated-covid-vaccines-restrictions-receive/story?id=125032817" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of those shots&lt;/a&gt; for those over age 65 and younger Americans who are at high risk for severe disease.

The team chopped on polyethylene and polypropylene boards, mixed the released particles into feed, and watched how the gut responded over weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny particles, called microplastics, are fragments of plastic smaller than 0.2 inches that can carry additives and hitchhiking chemicals. The results did not look the same for each plastic, which matters for everyday kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-cutting-board-study"&gt;Inside the cutting board study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Hai-Jun Gan from the School of Environment at &lt;a href="https://hjxy.nju.edu.cn/English/HOME/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanjing University&lt;/a&gt;, used two common plastics, polypropylene and polyethylene – then prepared mouse diets on these boards for four and 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene particles averaged about 10 micrometers, while polyethylene pieces averaged about 27 micrometers, which means the polypropylene feed contained many more particles for the same mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By week 12, the diets prepared on plastic carried roughly a milligram of microplastics per gram of feed, and the number rose with repeated chopping cycles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent laboratory work reported that a single cut on a new polypropylene board can release on the order of 100 to 300 particles, which helps explain why older boards tend to shed more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-plastics-different-effects"&gt;Different plastics, different effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene did not just ride through the gut. Mice eating polypropylene board &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dishwashers-release-nearly-a-million-plastic-particles-per-cycle/"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; showed higher blood markers that track inflammation and gut barrier stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The markers included lipopolysaccharide and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-reactive-protein-test/about/pac-20385228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt;, and lower expression of tight junction genes that help seal the intestinal wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene told a different story. The mice did not show clear signs of inflammation, but their gut microbiota shifted after 12 weeks, with a lower share of &lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt; and a higher share of &lt;em&gt;Desulfobacterota&lt;/em&gt; in the cecum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift lined up with distinct changes in fecal and liver metabolites, especially bile-acid related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrast matters. It points to particle size, count, surface chemistry, and additives as separate levers of harm, instead of a single “plastic effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-polypropylene-boards-and-microplastics"&gt;Polypropylene boards and microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic cutting boards are not the only source of microplastics in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/food-packaging-is-leaking-harmful-chemicals-into-meals/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, but they are close to the action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis estimating real-world chopping suggested that people could ingest 7.4 to 50.7 grams per year from polyethylene boards and about 49.5 grams from polypropylene boards, depending on use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers track with the lab result that repeated chopping increases particle release as surfaces become scarred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are not limited to kitchens. They have been &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/glass-bottles-contain-more-microplastics-than-plastic-containers/"&gt;measured in human blood&lt;/a&gt;, which tells us that particles are bioavailable and can circulate to different tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical researchers have also detected plastics in carotid artery plaques and linked their presence to higher rates of heart attack, stroke, or death over nearly three years in a 304 patient cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings do not prove that plastic cutting boards cause disease. They show that human exposure is real, widespread, and worth reducing where it is sensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-response-to-different-plastics"&gt;Gut response to different plastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut barrier is more than a wall. It is a dynamic system that includes mucus, tight junctions, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daylight-boosts-the-immune-systems-ability-to-fight-infections/"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; signals, and bacterial metabolites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene particles in this experiment lined up with lower expression of genes that help seal that barrier and higher activity of myosin light chain kinase, a protein that can loosen junctions and permit lipopolysaccharide to enter the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene pushed on metabolism and community structure instead. Bile acids, the detergents our livers make to manage fat and signal to the gut, dropped in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, specific microbially shaped bile acids in the gut also shifted. That pattern fits a gut liver axis response, not a classic inflammatory spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One plastic leaned toward barrier injury. The other leaned toward ecosystem drift. Neither path is good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wood-is-not-a-perfect-solution"&gt;Wood is not a perfect solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People switch to wood to avoid plastic shedding. That can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-escaping-from-water-treatment-plants/"&gt;microplastic&lt;/a&gt; ingestion, but any swap needs basic hygiene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knife scars, moisture, and fat can trap microbes on any surface, and regulators have wrestled with these tradeoffs for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food safety guidance has long noted that wooden boards behave differently from scarred plastics and can be harder or easier to sanitize depending on use and cleaning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is routine cleaning, separation of raw and ready-to-eat foods, and timely replacement of boards that are deeply grooved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-weigh-plastic-risks"&gt;How to weigh plastic risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on the limited evidence available, chemicals and biofilms associated with microplastics in drinking-water pose a low concern for human health,” according to the World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is drinking water, not food, and it reflects what we know today, not a permanent verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where kitchen practice and common sense meet science. Replace old plastic boards more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid harsh scraping that chews up surfaces. Keep raw meat, seafood, and produce on separate boards, and clean thoroughly with hot water and detergent after each use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a bigger picture. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;Plastics&lt;/a&gt; differ by polymer and additives, and they age in different ways. Real exposure rarely involves clean, single-polymer spheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results in people may hinge on mixtures, particle sizes, and how the gut is already primed by diet, stress, medications, and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-directions-in-cutting-board-studies"&gt;Future directions in cutting board studies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse study used realistic chopping, not pristine pellets, which is why it stands out.

&lt;p&gt;The 68-year-old, who &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/10/fox-news-host-john-roberts-dead-ai-grok-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;refuted AI reports of his death&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, revealed he’s currently battling a serious bout of the mosquito-borne illness that the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;warns can be life-threatening&lt;/a&gt; “if not quickly diagnosed and appropriately treated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts said he was diagnosed with the potentially fatal disease on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had been hurting from the top of my head to the tip of my toes. Literally everywhere,” he told People. “I was also &lt;a href="https://people.com/fox-news-john-roberts-hospitalized-with-severe-malaria-exclusive-11799757" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;beset with uncontrolled shivering&lt;/a&gt; all during my show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-papQS7n5" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_papQS7n5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/america-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“America Reports”&lt;/a&gt; host said he initially thought the symptoms he experienced were “just muscle cramps and aches” until he began shivering. That’s when he began believing he had the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a visit to the rheumatologist, who determined his platelets and white blood cells were both low, he rushed to the emergency room, where he officially received his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought, ‘Of course you have malaria … You never do anything in small measures,'” Roberts said. “But I was a little scared. Malaria can be deadly if left unchecked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know exactly how ‘severe’ it was from a medical classification, but it sure felt severe,” he added. “I have never felt that sick in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;While thanking Fox News correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/trace-gallagher" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Trace Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; for filling in for him on air, Roberts said on social media he was “the only person in the hospital with malaria. In fact, one of my doctors said I’m the first case he has ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2,000 cases of malaria diagnosed every year in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

A blank whiteboard indicated zero patients during a visit Monday afternoon. But clinic leaders believe it’s a matter of time before it thrives like the locations in Eagan, Vadnais Heights and Woodbury that are staffed with ER doctors and have advanced imaging and lab capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The approach might be overkill for most patients with typical urgent care needs, such as tests for strep throat or persistent cough, but it saves time and money when treating patients with complex conditions who otherwise visit crowded hospitals, said Dr. Craig Matticks, the Urgency Room’s medical director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;“What we’re really good at in emergency medicine is figuring out what people have and figuring out what people need,” he said. “We’re bringing that into the outpatient setting for all those patients that don’t actually need immediate, critical interventions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The Urgency Room, a doctor-owned private practice, has grown despite competing in an urgent care marketplace dominated by large multispecialty health systems like Allina Health, HealthPartners and M Health Fairview. Each of the east metro Urgency Room locations treats more than 30,000 patients per year, Matticks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Emergency Physicians P.A. (EPPA) owns and staffs all four locations. The medical group started in the east metro to avoid competition with the hospital ERs at which its doctors work on contract, including Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, Southdale Hospital in Edina and North Memorial in Robbinsdale. But Matticks said they had been planning for years to add a west metro location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Physician-owned treatment centers have &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-03-28-select-financial-operating-and-patient-characteristics-pohs-compared-non-pohs-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-03-28-select-financial-operating-and-patient-characteristics-pohs-compared-non-pohs-fact-sheet"&gt;faced criticism from community hospitals&lt;/a&gt; because they often set up in wealthier suburbs and limit their exposure to low-income and uninsured patients. The Urgency Room takes low-income patients covered by Minnesota’s Medical Assistance program and uninsured patients, though they must submit a $350 deposit before receiving care, according to &lt;a href="https://www.urgencyroom.com/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.urgencyroom.com/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions/"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;EPPA’s urgent care model is unusual, but it’s responding to the same consumer demands that have resulted in more urgent care clinics nationally and also standalone emergency rooms, said Allan Baumgarten, a &lt;a href="https://allanbaumgarten.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://allanbaumgarten.com/"&gt;Twin Cities analyst&lt;/a&gt; of health care markets.

						&lt;p&gt;It is a month since we returned home from the Appalachian Trail. In truth, it has been a pretty chaotic month but we both feel pretty settled with it. Early in the month, both of us temporarily lost the memory the hike as a recent event. Strangely, when we thought about &lt;em&gt;The Trail&lt;/em&gt;, it was like a foggy memory. Now, it seems like something in the past but not a foggy past. As a psychologist, I know this is a process called&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sleeps-crucial-role-in-preserving-memory/"&gt;&lt;em&gt; memory stabilization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which new, easily disrupted memories are transformed into more resilient ones that are not subject to interference. Memories of specific events or experiences, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3079906/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;episodic memory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, blends with semantic (fact) memory and is encoded by the brain’s hippocampus and the neocortex.  The next step is &lt;em&gt;memory consolidation &lt;/em&gt;in which new neuronal pathways are formed. These pathways assure the information is stored, and can be retrieved, from long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our memories consolidate, we are contented with being home, and with the hike. Packrat, the owner of Hikers Welcome Hostel in Glenncliff, NH, sent us this week a photo he took of us. When we look at it, it sums up our years together, the hike, and the goodness we have post-hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Consolidating Our Experiences&lt;/h3&gt;

But because a psychologically rich life is the accumulation of rich experiences, it is important to journal, photograph and share them with others to maintain your memories. . . “As long as you are curating and storing your experiences in your psychological memorabilia, then you are enriching yourself every day” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;
&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;
&lt;p class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTE6EFE3V5AULPCYHOOWS3HDPA" data-el="text"&gt;A good life is typically thought of as being a happy one or a meaningful one. Recent research suggests another type of good life is a &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rev-rev0000317.pdf"&gt;psychologically rich one &lt;/a&gt;characterized by novel experiences, perspective-shifting insights, and complexity even though it may have more discomfort and challenges than other models. As hikers who voluntarily take on hard things, that rings true to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="null" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTE6EFE3V5AULPCYHOOWS3HDPA" data-el="text"&gt;When we set about to regather ourselves a few years ago, we took on the cornerstones of a healthy life addressing our physical, emotional and social wellbeing through nutrition, sleep, exercise and relationships. As we gained a deeper understanding of taking care of not only others, but ourselves also, we grew more mindful of how these things interact in our lives moment to moment. It is in part the luxury of aging, but we knew if we did not attend to these pillars of health, we would dwindle or die and not at some distant time in the future. That is a gift of aging. When you are younger, it can be harder to see our endpoints at humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="null" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTE6EFE3V5AULPCYHOOWS3HDPA" data-el="text"&gt;As we tried to think about how to share our transition back to “real life” with you, we decided it made sense to organize the experience on those pillars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="null" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTE6EFE3V5AULPCYHOOWS3HDPA" data-el="text"&gt;Over the past month, we have felt stress trying to take care of what we think of as deferred maintenance of our physical space, paperwork, our relationships, and even doctors appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some memory consolidation is taking place continuously, because, like a computer, we cannot retain but so much information in our short term memory. Big events need more time to “settle in” to our collected memories than routine ones. This is partly because we forget ordinary stuff, it was ordinary, so we don’t spend much biological effort to catalogue it. We can easily link it to our existing cognitive frameworks (&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-schema-2795873"&gt;schemas&lt;/a&gt;). Things that don’t fit well tend to require more effort to consolidate. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3079906/"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; is a key element of successful &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10807868/"&gt;memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew we would need to sleep a lot. Both science and experience has taught us sleep is a magic elixir for pain and grumpiness. It works for people of all ages but somehow, we forget and think it just applies to cranky toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps our crowning achievement as a couple has been to learn that stress makes us cranky and it is not personal. Of course, we don’t always adhere to that tenet, but we try. We have spent a lot of effort learning to say, “I feel cranky because of the stress of X,Y,Z”.  It does not fix the stress or the crankiness, but it does call time out for a moment. It works a lot better than snapping each others heads off and then apologizing. We have plenty of experience with both methods and can strongly recommend identifying the crankiness and, well, taking a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first couple of weeks it seemed like we were just eating and sleeping every moment that was not claimed by a deferred maintenance task. The Historian was sleeping more like a cat than a human, 13 to 15 hours a day. Just about the time I was getting frantic that he might not be OK, he woke up feeling normal and was much easier to be around than when his “I need a nap” period started. Between sleep and a little chiropractic care, The Historian’s back and my hip and shoulder pains are healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, our sleep quality was lower than on the trail for a few weeks home. A review of our fitness watch sleep data demonstrates the process. For the first week after the hike, we blew off our poorer than normal sleep attributing it to all the movement from place to place and shifting from sleeping pads back to a bed. That was followed by a couple of weeks of higher than normal sleeping heart rates and lower than normal &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv"&gt;heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt;. We are finally returning to our pre-hike baseline and feel much more “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have discussed what might be the cause, but came to no conclusion. We considered that it was stress of too much deferred maintenance, or easy access to too much food too close to bedtime, or even not observing hiker midnight since we had electric lights. We also thought it might be related to exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Peaking, and Overtraining&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we figured out in our memory consolidation was that our athletic ability peaked at different times on the journey. Timing your peak for an athletic event is some science and some guessing and some luck, as any competitive athlete can tell you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was peaking as we approached Katahdin. A couple of weeks before we got there, I suddenly was filled with energy and the knowledge I could hike on for weeks more. Earlier in the trip, I had moments of serious doubt that I could ever feel good distance hiking. I never doubted I would have the resolve to go to the end, but I also wondered if it would always hurt and be a drudge to hike. This is not the same as getting “trail legs.” We reached a point at about 6 weeks when we could grind out more miles in fewer hours, what we considered trail legs. What happened at about 2 1/2 months was more like, “Oh, yes! I remember how to be a distance hiker.” I realized I could have hiked on for months before I fell apart. Even my fitness watch considered 10 mile days with a pack as “not exercise,” advising me to increase my exercise load if I wanted to improve my fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Historian peaked much earlier than I and then reached a state of &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/what-to-know-about-overtraining"&gt;overtraining&lt;/a&gt; at the end of Virginia. We were similarly challenged, mentally and physically, with the hike for the first few weeks. Then, he moved ahead in his hiking competence. It was his physical energy and emotional resolve that kept me walking through the physical and psychological injuries I sustained from all the wet. He picked me up off the trail many times, literally and figuratively. Toward the end, he simply had no “go” left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, he commented, “When I reached the end of Virginia, I was done.” He did hike some after that, but it was difficult and his body exhibited the classic signs of overtraining including unusual muscle soreness, performance decline, prolonged general fatigue, inability to relax, poor sleep, appetite loss, gut problems, lack of energy, motivation, and flat affect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exercise Routine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave us a few days of lolling about and then started prodding us to get back to exercising. We are blessed with a lovely set of hiking and Nordic ski trails near our house. Even when we are very busy, we can get in a good jaunt within about an hour. Typically, after breakfast we take off for a 1 1/2 to 2 mile sojourn that gets our heart rates up. The trail we most commonly do is 1.5 miles. It roughly breaks down into three 1/2 mile sections, one flat, one 250 feet down, and one 250 feet up. Our typical time is 32-35 minutes with our shortest being 28. The typical exercise load on our fitness watches, depending on the temperature (colder is higher load), is 45 to 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173450/20250801_103146-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-515840" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173450/20250801_103146-700x933.jpg" alt="male day hiker on trail with hiking poles"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started back, we walked through the track in 32 minutes and got NO exercise credit for it. A swift pace on this trail did not raise our heart rate enough to count. An adjustment was required. Now, we are pressing as hard as we can to keep the pace over 3 miles per hour, including the uphills. Some younger hikers saw us coming up the steep section at 2.8 miles per hour and commented that we “had quite a head of steam worked up.” At an average of 3 1/2 miles per hour, we are getting exercise credit from our watches, but I also have a sneaking suspicion that it is not just our increased effort, but that we are slowly losing our trail fitness. It is sad to see it go, but not unexpected. We had hoped to squeeze in a backpacking trip to the Bob Marshall Wilderness before we lost our trail legs, but maybe not. We can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nutrition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most hikers tell stories about the moment they realized they had to change their eating habits–both for the trail, and after returning to real life. Neither of us realized that hiker hunger would last past the hiking part. I thought it would be more like having gotten used to eating more than we need in town than literally feeling ravenous. It took us a couple of weeks to stop feeling like we were starving all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it is shocking that we felt so genuinely hungry given how much we were eating the first couple of weeks. Now, I am not preparing salad for 100 every meal. We were, before the hike, and continue, after the hike, to be big eaters. We eat mountains of vegetables each day to which we add grains and plant protein along with an occasional animal protein. We make a gallon of yogurt each week and since coming back, we have run through the gallon in less than a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Historian struggled with keeping weight on during the hike. We never saw how much he weighed at his lowest, but suspect he crossed below 150 pounds, which was too little for him. We do know his body fat got below 20% and stayed in the low 20% range for most of the hike. Toward the latter part of the trip, his weight stabilized at 160 and he would like to stay in that range. So far, so good. He is eating a healthy diet and a goodly amount of food but not losing or gaining weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue with my thrifty metabolism. If famine were to strike, I would be well prepared. While on the trail, I reduced my calories to 1800-2200 per day in order to shift food to The Historian. I did not lose weight. I will write more about that later in a blog on our food, but for now, suffice it to say that it does not take much to keep my motor running. I did lose weight while on the trail, but mostly I compacted what I had. I continue to record everything I eat, and have shifted my caloric intake downwards to 1500-1800 calories per day and am maintaining my post-trail weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_515842" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173844/20250825_124237-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-515842" class="wp-image-515842 size-large" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173844/20250825_124237-700x732.jpg" alt="large bowl of salad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-515842" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;My lunch salad fills up a noodle bowl. The Historian’s was a little smaller, but he added toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who audit our grocery purchases (ha ha), I can say I am proud that we finally got all the quasi-mess we left from dehydrating trail food preparing our resupply boxes cleaned up. The refrigerator is well organized and ready for action to feed us with wet food. We make our own yogurt from milk we get from the dairy down the road and we rehydrate and cook our own beans. The garden would usually be bursting at this time of year but since we were gone during the planting season, we are purchasing more than usual. We still have a lifetime supply of onions from the garden. Kale and radishes are coming along. We hope the peas will come in before the winter hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say it feels strange to reach in the fridge and pull out beans and grains without having to remember to cold soak them hours before. It is a bit of trouble to make yogurt more than once a week but it seems to just disappear. The sour cream in the top right is for one of our resident animals (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28175305/20250827_160257-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-516801" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28175305/20250827_160257-700x933.jpg" alt="Photo of the inside of an organized refrigerator "&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Catching Up With Family&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big stressors for us, and probably for anyone with family, has been reuniting with the daily activity of our families. Everyone lovingly withheld requests for our time while we were hiking. However, there has been a lot of deferred maintenance this month. I have not handled this as well as I would have liked. It felt like an oncoming train. Thankfully, after we got through a stack of doctors appointments and cleaned the house, it is feeling less stressful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elder we provide care for did very well while we were gone. As we had hoped, she gained confidence in what she could do for herself since we were not there to do some of the routine chores we do for her. She, and we, are very proud of her efforts. Unfortunately, the week after we returned, she became ill and spent a week in the hospital. After she was home and assessing the effect of our trip on her, she declared that “it was a long trip” and was hard on her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other family had been waiting for us to return so they could visit. We were able to see my sister on our return home. Another family member came to visit last week and we are scheduled to travel to visit yet more family in a couple of weeks. We had a great meal with family and the mailed Love Gap Cookie friends. I even took a video and texted it to our fellow hiker-foodie Daddy Longlegs who is a SOBO about half-way through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28175634/20250822_160411-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-516802" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28175634/20250822_160411-700x933.jpg" alt="homemade mezza buffet including flatbread and multiple salads and herbs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good to have family, but also requires us to think more broadly than when we were on the trail. Our metaphor for this an insider joke about what to have for dinner. While on the trail, the answer usually was “the heaviest one.” With so much visiting, we have had to think beyond the grams that just the two of us are carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one family visit, we were magically able to get a pass to drive the Going to the Sun Road, which everyone enjoyed, setting aside a little acrophobia–a normal response to the narrow road with few guardrails. Looking into the valley from Logan Pass and realizing that we hiked the equivalent of top to bottom and back up top on an average day was quite shocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_515844" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25174210/20250821_153943-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-515844" class="wp-image-515844 size-large" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25174210/20250821_153943-700x495.jpg" alt="Mountains with blue sky and grass with wildflowers in front"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-515844" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A view from Going to the Sun Road in Glacier National Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Catching up with Friends: Our Coming Out Party&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regular readers know, in addition to our family, we had a group of friends who supported us on the hike. We had a celebratory meal with this circle of friends, they resolve ones who launched us with the &lt;a href="https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/the-pre-trail-to-do-emotions-anxiety-and-gratitude/"&gt;blessing of our rings and hiking trip&lt;/a&gt;. It was our treat, and we brought a sample of trail food and a sample of town food. We also got a great big cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People generally were surprised at the palatability of the trail food. They were not impressed with our chia, flaxseed, and protein powder breakfast although they allowed as how it was functional. The town food was popular but mostly everyone ate cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25174422/20250810_095642-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-515855" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25174422/20250810_095642-700x273.jpg" alt="a buffet marked trail food including backpacking food rehydrated"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Animals in Our Lives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were gone, the animals continued their occupation of our yard. The local bear ate all the apples off the right side of our tree. The deer babies from last year have grown up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_515841" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173704/20250808_103705-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-515841" class="wp-image-515841 size-large" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173704/20250808_103705-700x890.jpg" alt="two male deer with antlers resting in front of a wood pile and lawn chair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-515841" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Last summer’s deer twins born in our yard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if the humingbirds changed or if we did, but we have been able to watch them up close in the garden. Perhaps they were always here but our eyes are seeing natural movements differently after being on the trail. I managed to get video of a humming bird sitting on the fence for over a minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28180024/20250823_130932-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-516803" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28180024/20250823_130932-700x933.jpg" alt="hummingbird on fence by pansy plants"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our resident squirrel is also more casual around us. I caught it napping in a tree the other day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28180209/20250825_190410-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-516804" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28180209/20250825_190410-700x933.jpg" alt="squirrel napping on tree"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days home, I was working in the garden and was hailed by a very loud kitten that was living under our deck. We have no idea what happened to the mother or other kittens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kitten was clearly in distress, nearly starved to death and muddy. We could not come close to approaching it, but thought perhaps if we got it inside and fed it, we could take it to the vets and find a home for it. We left it a trail of food into our house and it came in. It loves sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cat has now been living behind the washing machine in our kitchen for a month and we still cannot touch it. It talks to us and rolls around on the floor purring at us but runs when we try to approach. We captured it once by subterfuge and terrified it. Eventually, it did settle down and purred and accept pets but we decided to leave it untouched. For now, we have a wild animal living in our house with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, before you say we should keep it, no. We should not keep it. We keep eying it, ready to pounce, when it goes after our furniture. We have done cats, but we are not cat people and this cat needs someone who will love it unreservedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, we cannot tell if it is male or female (we suspect male). It needs a name. If anyone has a suggestion, we are all ears!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_515858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25174643/20250820_095731.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-515858" class="wp-image-515858 size-large" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25174643/20250820_095731-700x762.jpg" alt="gray and white kitten on wooden stool"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-515858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Meow.

							&lt;p&gt;We all know them. The people who make you do a double-take when they mention their age. Not because they've had work done, but because they seem to have negotiated a better deal with time. They move like they're younger, their skin glows without Instagram filters, and they have that energy that makes you wonder what they're putting in their coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: they're not doing anything you couldn't do. No exotic supplements, no $500 face creams, no bizarre biohacking. They've just been quietly consistent with habits most of us know about but somehow never stick to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference isn't what they know—it's what they actually do, every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They protect their sleep like it's sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just getting eight hours—actually protecting the quality of those hours. They have bedtimes that would make teenagers roll their eyes. They've been turning off screens an hour before bed since before it was trendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/good-nights-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; affects cellular regeneration more than any serum ever could. While you're scrolling at midnight, they're giving their bodies time to actually repair the damage of existing. Their growth hormone is doing its job while yours is struggling against blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They treat sleep like a non-negotiable appointment with aging prevention. Boring? Maybe. Effective? Look at their skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They move constantly, not intensely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're not CrossFit warriors or marathon runners. They just never really stop moving. They take stairs without thinking about it. They garden, walk to get coffee, stretch while watching TV. Movement is woven into their day, not scheduled into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This constant, gentle activity keeps their &lt;a href="https://www.visiting-angels.co.uk/middlesex/blog/daily-activities-and-exercise-for-the-elderly/#:~:text=It%20(%20Exercise%20)%20also%20supports%20better,the%20benefits%20to%20cardiovascular%20health%20are%20significant." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;metabolism active&lt;/a&gt; and joints lubricated. They avoid the inflammation that comes from both extreme exercise and complete sedentary living. Their bodies stay functional because they keep using all the functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about workout intensity; it's about never letting their body forget how to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They eat real food without making it weird&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dramatic diets, no superfood obsessions, no elimination protocols that make dinner parties awkward. They just eat actual food—vegetables, fruits, proteins—most of the time. They've been doing this since before kale had a publicist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their approach to eating patterns is remarkably undramatic. They eat sugar occasionally without guilt. They have wine with dinner sometimes. But their baseline is real, recognizable food that doesn't need a nutrition label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They figured out that consistency beats perfection. Their cells are well-fed, not confused by constant dietary whiplash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They hydrate like it's their job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water bottle always within reach, but you never see them forcing down gallons. They sip constantly, automatically, like breathing. Their skin cells are perpetually plump, their joints cushioned, their organs functioning smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper hydration affects everything from skin elasticity to cognitive function. But they're not water-logging themselves. They maintain steady hydration rather than cycling between desert and flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lips aren't chapped, their skin doesn't flake, and they never get those dehydration headaches. Water is their most basic beauty secret, and they've been consistent about it for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They manage stress instead of denying it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't pretend stress doesn't exist—they've just developed actual strategies for dealing with it. Maybe it's meditation, maybe it's walking, maybe it's calling a friend. But they have a plan that isn't "push through and collapse later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress is aging's best friend, breaking down collagen and accelerating cellular damage. These people learned early that stress management isn't self-indulgence—it's self-preservation. They process emotions instead of storing them in their jaw, shoulders, and eventually, their face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They look younger because they're not carrying twenty years of unprocessed tension in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They maintain social connections actively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not social media connections—actual humans they see and talk to regularly. They have standing coffee dates, regular calls with old friends, conversations with neighbors. They invest in relationships like they're compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social connections&lt;/a&gt; age people better than any intervention. These folks understood this before the research proved it. They maintain their social network like it's critical infrastructure—because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their faces are animated from actual conversations, not just selfie practice. They laugh real laughs regularly. Connection keeps them vital in ways no supplement can replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They protect their skin from the sun religiously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not hiding indoors—just being smart about exposure. They've been wearing sunscreen daily since the 1990s. Hats aren't fashion statements; they're face-savers. They find shade automatically, like plants finding light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3790843/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sun damage&lt;/a&gt; accounts for up to 80% of visible facial aging signs. While everyone else was pursuing the perfect tan, they were playing the long game. Their skin cells haven't been repeatedly traumatized by radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They still enjoy the outdoors—they just do it without volunteering their face as a solar panel. Their wrinkles are from smiling, not from decades of squinting against sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's maddening and liberating: none of this is revolutionary. These aren't secrets—they're basics that compound over time. The 60-year-olds who look 45 didn't discover anything we don't know. They just did the boring, sensible things consistently while everyone else was looking for shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started these habits in their thirties and forties, when the damage was still reversible and the habits still had time to compound. They chose daily disciplines over future procedures. They prevented instead of corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, aging well isn't about finding the fountain of youth—it's about not poisoning the well you already have. It's about treating your body like you plan to keep living in it, because you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people look younger because they've been living like they respect their future selves for decades. They didn't wait for a health scare or a bad photo to start taking care of themselves. They just quietly, consistently chose the habits that honor the body they're in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, more than any cream or procedure, is why they look the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health issue worldwide. Many patients end up requiring regular dialysis to avoid kidney failure and stay alive. Despite the severity of the condition, there are currently no drugs available that improve kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A research group led by Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine's Professor Takaaki Abe has found a remarkable solution to treat patients with CKD by co-opting a drug typically used for constipation. This is the first time that this drug (lubiprostone) was shown to prevent the decline of renal function in patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw3934" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We noticed that constipation is a symptom that often accompanies CKD, and decided to investigate this link further," explains Abe. "Essentially, constipation disrupts the intestinal microbiota, which worsens &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; function. Working backwards, we hypothesized that we could improve kidney function by treating constipation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, the group conducted a multicenter Phase II clinical trial (LUBI-CKD TRIAL) at nine Japanese medical institutions, enrolling 150 patients with moderate CKD. This study evaluated the effects of lubiprostone on kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that, compared to the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/placebo+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;placebo group&lt;/a&gt;, the decline in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney function&lt;/a&gt; (defined as the estimated glomerular filtration rate: eGFR) was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in patients treated with 8 µg or 16 µg of lubiprostone.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated the mechanism underlying how this effect occurred. They found that lubiprostone increases spermidine production, which improves mitochondrial function by promoting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bacterial+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacterial growth&lt;/a&gt; in the gut. The improved mitochondrial function was seen to exert a renoprotective effect—suppressing further kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the research team has plans to validate the trial results in a larger population (Phase III clinical trial) and advance the exploration of biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy. Their goal is to provide each patient with CKD the optimal treatment plan tailored to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery has the potential to significantly transform the conventional approach to CKD treatment, which primarily focuses on reducing uremic toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy in which laxatives suppress renal function decline. This strategy is expected to contribute to the development of treatments for not only CKD, but also mitochondrial dysfunction disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

They may also eat non-food objects or steal from other people's plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marilena Aiello, a neuroscientists who researches the condition, said previously: 'These behaviors are problematic, of course, socially, but also with regard to patients' health as they tend to gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But], some people lose weight because they eat a narrow range of foods in an obsessive way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear why the condition may cause this behavior, but researchers say it is potentially linked to alterations in the body's signals for hunger and fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bruce Willis, pictured above with wife Emma Heming in July 2018, is a sufferer of frontotemporal dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not known whether Bruce Willis suffers from any compulsive eating behaviors as a result of his condition, but his family has said he is struggling with communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15036003/bruce-willis-wife-subtle-symptom-frontotemporal-dementia-diagnosis.html"&gt;And earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, his wife Heming Willis revealed the subtle sign he started to suffer shortly before his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/video/bruce-willis-wife-emma-heming-willis-speaks-124980747"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;: 'For someone who is really talkative, very engaged, he was just a little more quiet, and when the family would get together he would kind of just melt a little bit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also soon began losing words, she said, and a stutter he dealt with as a child returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[He] felt very removed, a little cold, not like Bruce, who is very warm and affectionate to going the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In frontotemporal dementia, behavioral changes are normally the first noticeable sign of the disease. In Alzheimer's, for comparison, which affects up to 6.7million people,  the first signs are normally memory loss or confusion with time or place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, more areas of the brain degenerate, meaning patients with frontotemporal dementia eventually often mirror those with late-stage Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say that people suffering from the condition may have compulsive eating behaviors (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms of frontotemporal dementia include difficulty eating or swallowing, trouble walking and being vulnerable to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is not normally fatal on its own, but weakens the body and raises the risk of life-threatening infections or other complications. This may include problems swallowing or eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for the disease, although some drugs and therapies may help to slow the progression of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also not clear what causes the dementia, although it has previously been linked to a build-up of protein clumps in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some researchers say it can also be caused by damage to blood vessels in the brain, that they say can affect the supply of nutrients and oxygen to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:10:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQY1d6ZlVrX2pQeHNMUkFuU3hseEdHTVpoVHBCWHVxMDdvSzBzZWxDalBVZ1dQNUt2TzRnUHB5NVhFSGhRQm1hVzdVTkZGSi1qNjgwS1JIZXQ3OU5Ma3pqVlNRbDNaVXFMenRpOVh5QmYxbDF2UXA1ZVZpUjRfZDdHUUVITUZSS2lfdkRHbzFGRURNSzEyM1RKNUJhMTRZMlnSAaQBQVVfeXFMUC1qMDBDT3RtdUVHdm8zLTdJdTRKUE1xZHRVWGVqOHNUSzlfWFBmWmVqRUJRVjNQLUlCZVVxZldpUWxLbnUzaU9lYVdlcDNyd1V1bU9WZW45TXlnc29fNDFoTFBlUW8wYk95SGZVbEUtaXdBc2pFWU5WaDd3cVBCdU5iREFsNEh0ZVlHSUd1eFR0REMwYjVEbllNVjdBdGMwWWJNd20</guid></item><item><title>纽约市宣布第7例死亡宣布后，哈莱姆军团疫情爆发结束- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/7th-person-dies-legionnaires-outbreak-harlem-114-confirmed-cases-rcna227951</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d019d" class="body-graf"&gt;New York City health officials on Friday declared the Harlem Legionnaires’ disease outbreak over, a day after revealing a seventh associated death as the patient count ticked up slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-007cf0" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been no new cases among people who live and work in the affected area since Aug. 9, health officials said, meaning the cluster can be considered ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6066db" class="body-graf"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, which grow in warm water and spread through building water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-407ac5" class="body-graf"&gt;In total, health officials said 90 people were hospitalized throughout the duration of the outbreak, which went back to late July.

In mice, antibody-producing B cells that normally reside in the gut were found migrating into brain border regions, influenced by chemokine signals from inflammatory brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeding the animals a high-fiber diet restored gut immune balance and reduced frailty symptoms, even without lowering plaque levels. The findings suggest that the gut–immune–brain axis could be a powerful target for new Alzheimer’s therapies and healthy aging interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Migration:&lt;/strong&gt; Gut-derived B cells were found in the Alzheimer’s brain, guided by chemokines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietary Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; High-fiber inulin restored gut immune balance and reduced frailty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthspan Gain:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber did not reduce plaques but improved quality of life in mouse models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Buck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gut contains the largest collection of immune cells in the body. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research at the Buck Institute shows that some of those immune cells travel along the brain/gut axis in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) providing a potential new therapeutic pathway for the memory-robbing malady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112533"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain, the gut and fruits." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the study provides a comprehensive characterization of gut immune system changes in a neurological disease, researchers say more work is needed to see if those changes are a response to brain alterations or whether they drive the disease itself. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the August29, 2025 issue of &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports,&lt;/em&gt; also shows that feeding the mice a high fiber diet reduces AD-related frailty, including tremor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This paper brings the gut immune system to the forefront of neurodegenerative disease pathology,” says Buck associate professor Daniel Winer, MD, an immunologist and co-senior author of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given its size and the cells’ ability to travel, it makes sense that those immune cells would have the ability to influence larger physiology.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buck professor Julie Andersen, PhD, a neuroscientist and co-senior author adds, “As far as we know, this is the deepest investigation of the gut immune system in a model of neurodegenerative disease. We look forward to studying its impact in other diseases including Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by postdoctoral fellow Priya Makhijani, PhD, an immunologist who holds a joint appointment in the Winer and Andersen labs. She found that specific antibody-producing B cells, normally responsible for keeping the microbiome and the gut immune system in harmony, were reduced in the mice bred to develop AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also discovered that this cell type has a migratory signature; researchers found the gut-specific B cells and their migratory receptors in the brain and in its border region, the meningeal dura mater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remarkably, we found that these immune cells in the brain border which recognize bacteria living in the intestines were accumulating in the AD brain,” Makhijani says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting to understand what was driving the loss of immune cells in the gut, Makhijani and team found that this gut immune cell receptor’s binding partner, a well-studied chemokine known for migration, was produced at higher levels in the glia, the inflammatory cells in the AD brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migratory signature was also identified in human AD brains via data mining of previously conducted studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with collaborators at the University Health Network, part of the University of Toronto, the team conducted blocking experiments in the axis using a small molecule drug, suggesting that a new long-range mechanism might be acting along the gut-brain axis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits of a high fiber diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Makhijani and team found that feeding the animals the anti-inflammatory pre-biotic fiber inulin restored balance in the gut of the AD mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found these migrating cells were replenished in the gut and that AD-related frailty, including the tremor trait, was reduced in the animals.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that inulin makes short chain fatty acids and other metabolites that concentrate in the gut and can also circulate systemically, she says the diet improved gut health and reduced chemokine signaling in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Again, this involved a bi-directional axis,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winer notes that while the high fiber diet did not consistently reduce the levels of plaques in the mice’s brain, it did impact overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We did an assay involving 31 metrics of aging in these mice. The diet definitely extended their healthspan, giving the animals a better quality of life,” he says, adding, “This project supports the ‘eat your fruits and vegetables’ advice that is featured in nearly every dietary recommendation.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides a comprehensive characterization of gut immune system changes in a neurological disease, researchers say more work is needed to see if those changes are a response to brain alterations or whether they drive the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winer says one possibility is that age-related insults might trigger AD-causing inflammation in the brain with chemokines signaling the gut immune system for help in dealing with the insult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “In the beginning the process is likely protective, but over time the gut becomes compromised setting the stage for more dangerous types of bacteria to flourish which fuels inflammation throughout the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makhijani is eager to explore the potential of understanding and/or altering the gut microbiome in the context of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe there is a microbiome that signals an increased risk of neurological disease. Perhaps we’ll be able to identify specific bacteria that set off immune system inflammation. What if we can inhibit the signaling chemokines early versus late in the disease process? Which would be protective for the whole system? This paper provides so many avenues for further exploration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Buck collaborators include&lt;/strong&gt; Taylor R.

&lt;p&gt;COLDWATER, MI (WTVB) – An individual at Coldwater High School was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB). The Branch- Hillsdale-St Joseph Community Health Agency (BHSJCHA) was recently notified and an investigation has been initiated. BHSJCHA has notified Coldwater High School (CHS), and has confirmed the individual is currently undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHS is working with the health agency  to identify potential students and staff from the Spring Semester of the 2024- 25 school year to determine who should be evaluated for TB infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming week, anyone identified as being potentially exposed to TB will receive a notification with recommendations for testing and a health&lt;br&gt;
questionnaire. BHSJCHA, in partnership with CHS, will communicate how the health questionnaire and testing can be completed. Evaluation and testing through BHSJCHA will be at no cost to family or staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your child are not identified as exposed to TB, no action is required on your part, and testing is not recommended. However, if you choose to seek testing for your peace of mind, you may contact your doctor or the BHSJCHA clinic at 517-279-9561 extension 123.&lt;br&gt;
You should Monitor for TB signs and symptoms in yourself or your child. Although it is cold and flu season, TB symptoms can be different. Active TB disease can cause a cough with or without blood, sweating at night, weight loss or inability to gain weight, low appetite, feeling tired, swollen glands, or chest pain,&lt;br&gt;
among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms can start gradually and not go away for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The umbrella review encompassed 248 individual meta-analyses, which synthesized data from over 200 controlled clinical trials involving more than 10,000 autistic people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review evaluated the evidence for 19 complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM) interventions, including oxytocin therapy, melatonin, music therapy, animal-assisted therapy and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also considered polyunsaturated fatty acids, dietary supplements theorized to support brain health, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive technique that uses a mild electrical current to modulate brain activity, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), another non-invasive method that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate or inhibit specific brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain stimulation techniques may help autism by modulating abnormal neural activity, either stimulating underactive areas or inhibiting overactive ones, and improving communication and synchronization between brain regions involved in social, communication, and cognitive functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis also included a wide range of other therapies, such as secretin, a hormone traditionally produced in the small intestine that plays a role in regulating the digestive system. It was used in the 1990s as an experimental treatment for autism, based on the idea that it might improve gastrointestinal issues and, consequently, behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also investigated acupuncture, Chinese medicine, including herbal mixtures and therapeutic massage, various diets, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research found that, on average, 54 percent of autistic people use some form of CAIM. In some studies, this figure was as high as 92 percent over a person's lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers added: ‘However, many studies and international clinical guidelines indicate a lack of efficacy—and, in some cases, adverse events—for this type of intervention in autism.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis evaluated alternative treatments based on their impact on both core symptoms of autism and a wide range of associated behaviors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For core symptoms, the review included social communication impairments, restricted and repetitive behaviors, sensory challenges, and overall symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Oxytocin therapy had the strongest evidence but was largely ineffective, showing only a small reduction in repetitive behaviors for autistic adults (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Several other therapies, like music and animal-assisted interventions for children, magnetic stimulation for teens and physical activity for adults, showed promising results, but findings were supported by very low-quality evidence, making their true effectiveness uncertain (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review also measured effects on key associated outcomes such as disruptive behaviors, co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and ADHD symptoms, adaptive functioning, cognitive abilities, quality of life, and language skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study specifically analyzed improvements in sleep quality and quantity as a secondary outcome of crucial importance, ‘given the significance of sleep for autistic individuals and their families that emerged from the screened papers,’ researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Samuele Cortese, NIHR Research Professor at the University of Southampton and co-senior author, said: ‘This study shows that when people want to know whether a treatment is effective, they shouldn’t just look at one single study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s essential to consider all the available evidence and how good that evidence is. Drawing conclusions from one low-quality study can be misleading.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also created &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ebiact-database.com/"&gt;an online platform&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier for people to see the evidence they generated on different CAIMS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their review WAS published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02256-9#Abs1"&gt;Nature Human Behavior.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Corentin Gosling, associate professor at the Paris Nanterre University and first author of the study, said: 'Ultimately, we hope this tool will support autistic people and practitioners in choosing together the best treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The umbrella review did not explicitly recommend any specific therapies over alternative ones. Still, the researchers suggested that the standard of care should be behavioral, educational, and developmental therapies that have a strong evidence base.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2000, about 1 in 150 children received an ASD diagnosis; by 2020, that figure had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14619253/america-autism-hotspots-data-rampant-epidemic.html"&gt;climbed to 1 in 31&lt;/a&gt;, a near-quadrupling that reflects both greater awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for an autism diagnosis is five, though the vast majority of parents notice developmental delays or atypical behavior in their children, particularly around social skills, as early as two years old. And rates at which children are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14025037/autism-spiked-kids-young-adults-health-experts.html"&gt;being diagnosed have spiked&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2825472#:~:text=The%20ASD%20diagnosis%20rate%20was,6.3%20per%201000%20in%202022."&gt;a 2024 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of millions of health records, diagnosis rates climbed 175 percent from 2011 to 2022, increasing from 2.3 to 6.3 per 1,000 people across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most significant rise was observed in young adults aged 26 to 34, whose rates jumped 450 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, children between the ages of five and eight continue to have the highest diagnosis rate, at 30 per 1,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A jump in diagnoses has largely been attributed to improvements in screening children, reduced stigma around the diagnosis and greater society-wide awareness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The precise cause of the condition remains unknown, recent studies indicate that environmental influences, such as exposure to pollution, maternal infections during pregnancy, and advanced parental age, may play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The more processed we see, the more and more sodium in the food and less potassium, meaning the ratio between the two has changed from 10:1 to 1:2 - a dramatic change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Potassium is crucial for cardiac function and we know from observational studies that low potassium increases the risk of arrhythmias and heart failures and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know that potassium can be increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we go below the normal range there is a marked increase in cardiovascular events. Even within the normal range we have a higher risk at low-normal potassium compared to high-normal.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: ‘We have a list of foods that we gave to the patients - white beets, beetroots, cabbage and so on are all high-content potassium-rich diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We did not recommend meat, which is also potassium rich, because it is also rich in sodium and counter-interacts the increase in potassium.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings of the POTCAST trial were simultaneously presented at the conference and published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients helped to increase their potassium intake saw their levels rise from under 4.3 mmol/L to 4.5mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Low potassium increases the risk of arrhythmias and heart failures and death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some 6.7 per cent of the intervention group were hospitalised due to an irregular heartbeat and 3.5 per cent experienced heart failure, compared with 10.7 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively, in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, clinical director at the British Heart Foundation and consultant cardiologist, said: ‘Many people in the UK are living with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, commonly known as an ICD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These automatically shock your heart if it goes into an abnormal and life-threatening rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘While having a shock may save your life, the experience can be unpleasant for some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This trial from Denmark found that increasing blood potassium levels into the high normal range in people with ICDs improved patient outcomes, and importantly reduced their chances of needing a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you’re advised by your doctor to improve your dietary potassium intake, you can do this by including more vegetables and fruit rich in potassium such as spinach, bananas or avocados in your diet, as well as pulses, fish, nuts, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Don’t be tempted to try to increase your potassium intake with supplements unless supervised by your doctor, as ending up with too high a potassium level is dangerous – for example it can cause cardiac arrest.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023/24 over 7,000 new ICDs were fitted in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Other key foods are spinach, lima beans, baked potato, yoghurt, banana and tuna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, dietitian Dr Carrie Ruxton said: ‘Everyone knows about cutting down on salt, but few people realise that increasing potassium is almost as important for preventing strokes and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The European Food Safety Authority highlighted a lack of potassium across Europe as a major diet concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the UK, the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey shows that a third of teenagers and a quarter of adults are at risk of potassium deficiency, with implications for blood pressure control and muscle function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We can do more individually to boost our potassium intakes by eating more fruit, vegetables and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Fruit juices are particularly rich in potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘A study published in Nutrients found that starting the day with a glass of orange juice provides 10 to 15 per cent of our daily potassium needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Other key foods are spinach, lima beans, baked potato, yoghurt, banana and tuna.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A banana contains around 500mg of potassium, half a baked potato contains around 600mg and a cup of raw spinach around 450mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institutes of Health recommends that adult males should consume 3,400mg of potassium daily and adult females should consume 2,600mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant or breast feeding women should consume significantly less and should consult a specialist if concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically concentrations of potassium in the blood range from about 3.6 to 5.0 millimoles per litre (mmol/L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;DANE COUNTY, Wis. — The first West Nile virus human case in Dane County was confirmed Thursday, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/wnv-data.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Wisconsin Department of Health Services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BXNAdMpmZ/" target="_blank"&gt;Public Health Madison and Dane County&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late July, the first West Nile virus human case was reported in Barron County. &lt;span&gt;Other human cases have been reported in Rusk and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Sheboygan counties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, this virus is spread to humans and other animals through the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes acquire WNV by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread directly from person to person, animal to animal, or animal to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Most people infected with West Nile virus, about 80%, do not develop symptoms. Those who do typically experience mild illness, such as fever, headache, fatigue, muscle aches and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four human cases, two hospitalizations and zero deaths as of Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin DHS has a website that details how people can &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/mosquito/bite-prevention.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"&gt;avoid mosquito bites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​COPYRIGHT 2025 BY CHANNEL 3000.

    &lt;p&gt;Two people have died from eating raw oysters that were contaminated with a flesh-eating bacteria, Louisiana health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is a bacteria that occurs in warm coastal waters. It is more common between May and October. The bacteria can cause illness when an open wound is exposed to contaminated waters, or when a person eats raw or undercooked seafood. Oysters are particularly risky, state health officials &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said in a July news release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can cause life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis, which may result in limb amputation, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. About one in five people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 22 cases of Vibrio vulnificus infection in Louisiana residents, the state department of health said. All of the victims were hospitalized. Four people have died, the health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the deaths were among people who had eaten raw Louisiana oysters. The other two deaths were among people who reported exposing an open wound to seawater. None of the victims have been identified. One of the victims who ate contaminated oysters was a Louisiana resident. The other lived out of state, the health department said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisiana has been seeing a higher number of Vibrio vulnificus infections and deaths, the state's health department said. During the past 10 years, the state has seen an average of seven infections and one death per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk of the bacteria is rising due to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-florida/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;warming oceans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Earlier this mont, Florida confirmed 13 cases of Vibrio vulnificus across 11 counties. Eight victims died, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/report-13-cases-of-flesh-eating-bacteria-eight-deaths-confirmed-in-florida/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS Miami reported&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Cases of the bacteria have been reported recently as far north as &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flesh-eating-bacteria-vibrio-vulnificus-falmouth/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Connecticut and New York. &lt;/p&gt;

That 4.6% absolute risk reduction (number needed to treat = 22) translated to a statistically significant 18% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.98; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; =.03). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both components contributed to this reduction. The hazard ratio was 0.86 for death (95% CI, 0.69-1.07) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.69-1.05) for first hospitalization for heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subgroup analyses yielded a moderate signal for a heterogenous treatment effect in which the benefit from digitoxin appeared strongest in patients with more advanced heart failure. Effect sizes were greater in patients with systolic blood pressure &amp;lt; 120 mm Hg vs greater than 120 mm Hg, and with heart rate ≥ 75 bpm vs &amp;lt; 75 bpm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total hospitalizations occurred in around 70% of both the digitoxin and placebo groups. Unlike patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction, wherein hospitalizations for heart failure are a small fraction of total hospitalizations, in DIGIT-HF, hospitalizations for cardiac causes represented the majority of total hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious adverse events occurred in 4.7% of patients in the digitoxin group vs 2.8% in the placebo group. There was no difference in &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/151907-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;sudden cardiac death&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five Lessons &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harm signal debunked&lt;/strong&gt;. One clear message from this trial is the safety of cardiac glycosides. While a few more patients had adverse effects from digitoxin, all the important signals of harm (death, cardiac death, and hospitalizations) were better on digitoxin — similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199702203360801?logout=true" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;DIG trial&lt;/a&gt; nearly 30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every suggestion of harm from cardiac glycosides has stemmed from observational analyses marred by selection bias, wherein sicker patients get the glycoside. When patients are randomly assigned, no harm from cardiac glycosides is observed. This lesson transcends any specific therapy and should infuse us with caution in making causal claims from nonrandom comparisons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive results despite good background therapy&lt;/strong&gt;. Patients in DIGIT-HF were well-treated with contemporary heart failure therapy, including beta-blockers, renin-angiotensin blockade, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (76%). Only 1 in 5 patients were on SGLT2 inhibitors due to the trial starting before approval of this drug class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the benefit occurred over and above baseline therapy complicates translation: Should patients with HFrEF now take five drugs rather than four? An even more provocative question: Since digitoxin costs almost nothing, should it be preferred in cost-constrained situations over SGLT2 inhibitors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinically meaningful effect size&lt;/strong&gt;: An absolute risk reduction of nearly 5% in death and first heart failure hepatization compares favorably to the most recent &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;SGLT2 inhibitor&lt;/a&gt; trials. And the signal appears even stronger in patients with lower blood pressure and higher heart rate. Considering the low cost of digitoxin only enhances the clinical meaningfulness of the effect size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slightly less than a third of patients in the trial had &lt;a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/151066-overview" class="cl_ref_article"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;. Subgroup analysis based on atrial fibrillation (AF) status revealed no significant difference in effect size. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61373-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;meta-analysis of HF trials&lt;/a&gt; reported that beta-blocker benefit was isolated to patients with sinus rhythm. Perhaps patients with HFrEF and AF should receive cardiac glycosides for rate control before beta-blockers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical robustness is a concern&lt;/strong&gt;. DIGIT-HF had slow enrollment and lower-than-expected event rates despite having highly symptomatic patients with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 28%. This speaks to the benefits of modern HF therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upper bound on the hazard ratio for the primary endpoint was 0.98, nearly reaching 1.0, or no effect. The P-value, which tests how surprising the results were if you assumed no difference, was barely below the accepted (but arbitrary) threshold of.05. A handful of events in a different column would have yielded a “negative trial.” This differs from the SGLT2 inhibitor trials, which had highly persuasive P-values. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bayesian statisticians will tell you that the probability of benefit more than 0 is strong, but the probability of a 20% reduction in the primary outcome is not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 17 patients in the digitoxin arm and 8 in the placebo arm lost to follow-up. While that isn’t terrible, it is far more than the number of events it would have taken to change the results to nonsignificant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could tell you how to resolve the concern that the findings in DIGIT-HF could be noise rather than signal. But I can’t. The trialists made a great effort; the fact is that small numbers of events often add uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digitoxin is not digoxin. &lt;/strong&gt; In the US and other countries, only &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/lanoxin-digoxin-342432" class="cl_ref_drugs"&gt;digoxin&lt;/a&gt; is available. All cardiac glycosides bind to and inhibit the sodium-potassium ATPase pump (Na+/K+-ATPase) in cardiac myocytes. And both digoxin and digitoxin lead to similar effects: positive inotropy and neurohormonal modulation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are important pharmacodynamic differences. Digitoxin is easier to use and leads to steadier blood levels. Unlike digoxin, digitoxin is less affected by renal impairment because it has additional enterohepatic clearance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is important when it comes to translating evidence outside of a trial environment where patients may not have the same access to surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the small numbers of events in DIGIT-HF, even a tiny difference in clinical effects of digitoxin vs digoxin could be clinically meaningful. DIGIT-HF authors emphasize that the Dutch &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.3428" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;DECISION&lt;/a&gt; trial will test digoxin in patients with HFrEF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would be reluctant to translate results in the carefully done DIGIT-HF to &lt;em&gt;routine&lt;/em&gt; use of digoxin in US healthcare systems, where many patients have poor access to drug monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the audience at ESC, I felt a burst of optimism about our field when Professor Udo Bavendiek presented the trial. DIGIT-HF began with a bold idea. Bold because mainstream thinking had turned against cardiac glycosides. Bold because the old drug class has no industry backing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet a neutral observer of the history of heart failure trials could see reason to be optimistic about the use of cardiac glycosides. How easy it was to forget that more than 90% of patients in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199605233342101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;seminal carvedilol trial&lt;/a&gt; were on digoxin. Maybe the positive inotropy allowed beta-blockers to provide their benefit? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worry a little about the statistical robustness issue but lean on my positive priors (digoxin reduced heart failure hospitalizations in the DIG trial), the large effect size, and the high likelihood that digitoxin benefit is greater than 0. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that regulators bring back digitoxin for US clinicians. I am also excited to be able to use digoxin in selected patients without people worrying that we are giving poison to our patients. And I eagerly await the Dutch-led digoxin trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a great day for evidence-based cardiology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Mandrola, MD, practices cardiac electrophysiology in Louisville, Kentucky, and is a writer and podcaster for Medscape.

One dog will be quarantined at home for 45 days, while the other, which may not have been vaccinated, will have to quarantine for four months, likely in a state-approved animal facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commissioner &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-3457f0b0-84de-11f0-a068-65cab7738f81"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Betteridge, liaison to the Camden County Health Department, said in a statement: ‘Although rabies is a serious illness, it can be prevented by early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you have been bitten or scratched by a wild animal it is important that you seek immediate medical attention.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There have not been any human exposures &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14825135/seizures-paralysis-reality-rabies-death-Yorkshire-woman-dies.html"&gt;to the fatal virus&lt;/a&gt; in the state this year, according to county officials. But unvaccinated pets that come into contact with rabid animals and become infected can then pass the virus to their owner through bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past month, dozens of county governments from Maine to Wyoming have issued urgent warnings to residents and tourists about a surge in rabies cases among local wildlife, putting communities at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A skunk that came into contact with two family dogs has tested positive for rabies, marking the sixth confirmed case of the virus in a southern New Jersey county this year &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day before the skunk was discovered in Gibbsboro, a family dog in Barrington, New Jersey, about 15 minutes away, killed a raccoon that later tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three family members and both family dogs were potentially exposed to rabies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were advised to consult their physician about rabies post-exposure prophylaxis treatment, which consists of a fast-acting antibody shot followed by a four-dose series of shots administered over a 14-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without a quick response to a bite or scratch from a rabid animal, the disease is nearly 100 percent fatal. Over 90 percent of animal cases reported to the CDC are in wildlife, though one to three Americans die of the disease every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are typically fewer than 10 cases of rabies in the US each year. In recent years, the number of cases has ranged from one to five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four other animals, including a cat and two additional raccoons, have been confirmed to have rabies in New Jersey this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the US eliminated a specific canine rabies virus variant in 2007 through widespread vaccination of pets, the disease remains a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rabies is still transmitted by wildlife, including bats, raccoons, and skunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a vacation to Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona, Erica Kahn was photographing the night sky when a bat flew directly into her open mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Understanding the severe risk of rabies, her doctor father insisted she get the lifesaving post-exposure vaccine series immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Erica Kahn, who was visiting the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Arizona, was photographing the night sky when she saw bats flying in the area. One of them flew toward her face and, when she screamed, the bat flew into her mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Kahn, 33, enrolled in a health insurance plan, believing that she would be covered for the imminent two weeks of spaced-out rabies vaccinations. Then the bills came&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as she was between jobs and uninsured, Kahn urgently purchased a private health insurance policy, believing she had secured coverage for the necessary medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kahn soon discovered that her new insurance plan had a standard 30-day waiting period before coverage began, a detail she had missed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consequently, she was left responsible for over $20,000 in medical bills for the rabies vaccinations, as the insurer denied all her claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unvaccinated pets can contract the virus from these animals and transmit it to humans through their saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While human deaths are rare in the US, the risk of exposure appears to be rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This summer, more than 200 tourists from 38 states were potentially exposed to the near-always fatal virus by a bat colony at Wyoming's Jackson Lake Lodge, prompting a massive health outreach effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a separate incident earlier this month, a rabid fox attacked and bit two people in Aberdeen, North Carolina, who are now undergoing post-exposure treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following a bite, the rabies virus invades the peripheral nerves and travels to the brain, causing severe inflammation that can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;A 77-year-old unnamed man in North Carolina was bitten by the same animal on his leg (pictured) on his birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It attacks the brainstem, which disrupts the vital control of breathing and heart rate. Damage to the brain also triggers severe symptoms, including aggression, hallucinations, and a fear of water caused by painful throat spasms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once clinical symptoms emerge, the disease is nearly always fatal within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infected animals often exhibit erratic behavior, including biting themselves, excessive drooling, growling, and impaired coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nocturnal animals, such as foxes, raccoons, and bats, may appear disoriented and active during the day. Rabid bats may be grounded or fly in erratic circles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In North Carolina earlier this month, a young mother was attacked by a rabid fox after stepping outside her home to investigate noises resembling a cat under her car. The fox immediately bit her leg and, when she tried to defend herself, bit her hand as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After officers arrived and narrowly missed capturing the animal as it fled into nearby woods, they received a second call reporting a similar attack just a short distance away. There, a 77-year-old man had been bitten on the leg by the same fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deputies from Moore County Animal Services later located, captured, and euthanized the fox, which subsequently tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both victims received appropriate medical care for their injuries and potential exposure to the deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 14:48:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPa2dmZXlhNUdHSk1BaG1aRGVjdnE5LTg0a1dDTU5jWVhiakJGak5uV0w3bjR0S1RqcmlzQ2Mwek5BTE91RzVRazZ5UkNYVXFob1RIcUJOLW9kVlJJcFBmazFKMWR2RGRuWWgtVXk5ck03VHBFUlNFN2FVWWNMazY2RTNmQ3FPZk9uNExnYkpSUldVOG9QVEcyZEYzSHNialV2S0pjZGd6VmthdnVjdVHSAbMBQVVfeXFMTUR4VmZYUjZDbWt0b1hhdXp1ZG96b1FkZ2thS0pPUmpZRnRfUUtEd243ZmN5X1ZzZG16c1Qtd3NHRF8xRG1zOHJHdWhIY2VUT2hTOUxCN2NNcU1Lb2Z0UGdvZHp0WFVZZlpFRVB4YTlEU0g3UUdIb3hFR29qUkZOamRvWHFwS3ZYZU52YkpIaGNqZ3ZFM2JsMVh2QndYSmR4WUlEYmVVczNmeFpKUmtFak5xa0k</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情再次飙升，尤其是在这些州- NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/covid-is-spiking-again-especially-in-these-states/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

These are just two of the reasons that the signs of pancreas problems can slip by unnoticed or attributed to a different illness or condition. Considering that this is the norm, it doesn't come as much of a shock that pancreatic cancer has such a &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low survival rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low survival rate&lt;/a&gt; and that problems like pancreatitis can be so difficult to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the reason survival rates are so low is that identifying pancreatic cancer early is difficult," said &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/andrew-hendifar-546093.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Andrew Hendifar, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Andrew Hendifar, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of pancreatic cancer at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles. Early detection is also tough when it comes to non-cancer pancreas problems, added &lt;a href="http://www.fmridaho.org/residency/staff-member/ted-epperly-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ted Epperly, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ted Epperly, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician and the president and CEO of Full Circle Health, a teaching health center in Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/andrew-hendifar-546093.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Andrew Hendifar, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Andrew Hendifar, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the medical director of pancreatic cancer at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles; &lt;a href="http://www.fmridaho.org/residency/staff-member/ted-epperly-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ted Epperly, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ted Epperly, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician and the president and CEO of Full Circle Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tucked deep in your abdomen, your pancreas is a long, flat organ that produces enzymes and hormones that aid in digestion and blood sugar regulation, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. While symptoms of pancreas issues can be persnickety, both Dr. Epperly and Dr. Hendifar say there are a handful of warning signs that warrant a call to your doctor. Here are some of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pale, floating stool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice your stool is light colored and floating, that's a sign of poor nutrient absorption because of a pancreas malfunction. "The enzymes your pancreas produces help you digest fats in your diet," Dr. Hendifar explained. Along with breaking down fats, your pancreas helps your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins like A, E, and K, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pancreatic disease messes with your organ's ability to properly manufacture those enzymes, the result is feces that looks paler and is less dense. You may also notice your poop is oily or greasy. "The toilet water will have a film that looks like oil," Dr. Hendifar said. That's the dietary fat your body failed to break down, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice your poop looks funky now and then, that's no reason to freak out. But if all or most of your bowel movements have these characteristics, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Radiating back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdominal pain is one of the most common symptoms of both pancreatic cancer and acute pancreatitis, which is a type of deadly inflammation, Dr. Hendifar said. But that pain manifests in different ways depending on the underlying condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the pain seems to start in your middle before "radiating" into your mid or lower back—and if it lingers for weeks—that may be a sign of pancreatic cancer, Dr. Epperly said. Also, if you've already seen your doctor and he or she has prescribed a type of drug called a proton-pump inhibitor—such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or esomeprazole (Nexium)—let your doc know if your symptoms don't improve. Dr. Hendifar said it's common for doctors to mistake pancreatic cancer–triggered pain for reflux or other GI issues, many of which a proton-pump inhibitor should help resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the pain comes on suddenly and is intense and focused in the middle of your abdomen, that's the type associated with acute pancreatitis (sudden, temporary inflammation of the pancreas), Dr. Epperly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it's important to remember that a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of health issues—some serious, but many mild—can cause &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20514235/what-it-means-if-you-have-one-of-these-7-types-of-stomach-pains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stomach aches or pain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stomach aches or pain&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar added. But if either of the descriptions above sound familiar and you haven't found a way to get relief, it's best to give your doctor a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An unexpected diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pancreas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; produces hormones like insulin and glucagon that help maintain healthy levels of sugar in your bloodstream. When the pancreas is imperiled, it's common for sufferers to develop &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar said, because the production of these hormones will be thrown out of whack. If your weight is under control and you eat a healthy diet, a new diabetes diagnosis should lead to a closer examination of your pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same holds for a diabetes sufferer who suddenly finds her disease harder to manage, even if she is doing all the right things. "Those sudden changes in diabetes status without an obvious explanation, those are things we see associated with pancreatic cancer," Dr. Hendifar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nausea from high-fat foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nausea and vomiting are symptoms to watch out for—particularly if you've been eating fatty foods, Dr. Hendifar said. Again, because your pancreas produces enzymes that help your digestive system break down fat, diseases that mess with your pancreas tend to disrupt your body's fat-digesting capabilities, which leads to nausea. "Hamburgers are often nausea triggers, and so are avocados and nuts, which are all high in fat," Dr. Hendifar added. "Pizza is another one that's really tough for patients with a compromised pancreas." Dr. Epperly said pancreatitis is more likely than pancreatic cancer to lead to sudden vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rapid weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to credit your new diet, especially if you're actively trying to lose weight. But if you're shedding weight—and especially if you're experiencing the radiating pain described above—that weight loss could be due to the digestive issues associated with pancreatic cancer or disease, Dr. Hendifar said. A recent study in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lww.com%2Fctg%2Ffulltext%2F2020%2F12000%2Fassessment_of_weight_loss_and_gastrointestinal.20.aspx&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fa65926888%2Fsigns-of-pancreas-problems%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that among people who had acute pancreatitis, 24% had lost over 10% of their body weight a year after their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65595473/subtle-thyroid-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thyroid issues;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thyroid issues&lt;/a&gt; and some other health conditions can also cause rapid or unexplained weight loss.

Their habits, behaviors, and personality may have shifted slightly, but it can be difficult to piece together what they're feeling if they're not explicitly expressing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, pieces of our daily lives — like our home or the cars we drive — can be more insightful for partners and friends. In fact, if you notice these things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits. Like our bedrooms or living rooms, we spend a ton of time in our cars, and when we're struggling, this might be one of the first places to show it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you notice these 11 things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

So, if we're constantly surrounded by clutter, trash, and visual overwhelm, our brain is inevitably going to struggle with otherwise basic tasks like concentration, memory, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a deeper level, this clutter can make internal processes like emotional regulation more difficult. You're also operating from a baseline level of stress, anxiety, and overwhelm that visual clutter cultivates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you consistently notice these things in your wife's car, she's struggling more than she admits — not only because it's clear she doesn't have the time or energy to clean, but because the &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/ways-clutter-home-making-you-sick"&gt;clutter itself sets her up for a number of concerns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/constant-clutter-drains-you-need-these-things-stay-sane"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Constant Clutter Drains You, You Probably Need These 5 Things To Stay Sane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

So, it's not necessarily an immediate sign of internal struggle if your wife has engine lights or oil change needs in her car, but it could be a sign that she needs help managing her workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If she doesn't have the time or energy to get an oil change while managing everything else going on in her life, it might be time to rediscuss responsibilities and find a better balance that supports both partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/love/meaningful-conversations-strong-marriages-built-on"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Meaningful Conversations That Strong Marriages Are Built On, According To Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.

Why do some people with Alzheimer's-like changes in the brain never go on to develop dementia? These questions have bedeviled neuroscientists for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School may have found an answer: lithium deficiency in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work, published Aug. 6 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, shows for the first time that lithium occurs naturally in the brain, shields it from neurodegeneration, and maintains the normal function of all major brain cell types. The findings -- 10 years in the making -- are based on a series of experiments in mice and on analyses of human brain tissue and blood samples from individuals in various stages of cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that lithium loss in the human brain is one of the earliest changes leading to Alzheimer's, while in mice, similar lithium depletion accelerated brain pathology and memory decline. The team further found that reduced lithium levels stemmed from binding to amyloid plaques and impaired uptake in the brain. In a final set of experiments, the team found that a novel lithium compound that avoids capture by amyloid plaques restored memory in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results unify decades-long observations in patients, providing a new theory of the disease and a new strategy for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affecting an estimated 400 million people worldwide, Alzheimer's disease involves an array of brain abnormalities -- such as clumps of the protein amyloid beta, neurofibrillary tangles of the protein tau, and loss of a protective protein called REST -- but these never explained the full story of the disease. For instance, some people with such abnormalities show no signs of cognitive decline. And recently developed treatments that target amyloid beta typically don't reverse memory loss and only modestly reduce the rate of decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also clear that genetic and environmental factors affect risk of Alzheimer's, but scientists haven't figured out why some people with the same risk factors develop the disease while others don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium, the study authors said, may be a critical missing link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The idea that lithium deficiency could be a cause of Alzheimer's disease is new and suggests a different therapeutic approach," said senior author Bruce Yankner, professor of genetics and neurology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS, who in the 1990s was the first to demonstrate that amyloid beta is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study raises hopes that researchers could one day use lithium to treat the disease in its entirety rather than focusing on a single facet such as amyloid beta or tau, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main discoveries in the study is that as amyloid beta begins to form deposits in the early stages of dementia in both humans and mouse models, it binds to lithium, reducing lithium's function in the brain. The lower lithium levels affect all major brain cell types and, in mice, give rise to changes recapitulating Alzheimer's disease, including memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors identified a class of lithium compounds that can evade capture by amyloid beta. Treating mice with the most potent amyloid-evading compound, called lithium orotate, reversed Alzheimer's disease pathology, prevented brain cell damage, and restored memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the findings need to be confirmed in humans through clinical trials, they suggest that measuring lithium levels could help screen for early Alzheimer's. Moreover, the findings point to the importance of testing amyloid-evading lithium compounds for treatment or prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other lithium compounds are already used to treat bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, but they are given at much higher concentrations that can be toxic, especially to older people. Yankner's team found that lithium orotate is effective at one-thousandth that dose -- enough to mimic the natural level of lithium in the brain. Mice treated for nearly their entire adult lives showed no evidence of toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human clinical trial," Yankner said. "But so far the results are very encouraging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lithium depletion is an early sign of Alzheimer's &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yankner became interested in lithium while using it to study the neuroprotective protein REST. Finding out whether lithium is found in the human brain and whether its levels change as neurodegeneration develops and progresses, however, required access to brain tissue, which generally can't be accessed in living people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the lab partnered with the Rush Memory and Aging Project in Chicago, which has a bank of postmortem brain tissue donated by thousands of study participants across the full spectrum of cognitive health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having that range was critical because trying to study the brain in the late stages of Alzheimer's is like looking at a battlefield after a war, said Yankner; there's a lot of damage and it's hard to tell how it all started. But in the early stages, "before the brain is badly damaged, you can get important clues," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by first author Liviu Aron, senior research associate in the Yankner Lab, the team used an advanced type of mass spectroscopy to measure trace levels of about 30 different metals in the brain and blood of cognitively healthy people, those in an early stage of dementia called mild cognitive impairment, and those with advanced Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium was the only metal that had markedly different levels across groups and changed at the earliest stages of memory loss. Its levels were high in the cognitively healthy donors but greatly diminished in those with mild impairment or full-blown Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team replicated its findings in samples obtained from multiple brain banks nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observation aligned with previous population studies showing that higher lithium levels in the environment, including in drinking water, tracked with lower rates of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the new study went beyond by directly observing lithium in the brains of people who hadn't received lithium as a treatment, establishing a range that constitutes normal levels, and demonstrating that lithium plays an essential role in brain physiology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lithium turns out to be like other nutrients we get from the environment, such as iron and vitamin C," Yankner said. "It's the first time anyone's shown that lithium exists at a natural level that's biologically meaningful without giving it as a drug."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Yankner and colleagues took things a step further. They demonstrated in mice that lithium depletion isn't merely linked to Alzheimer's disease -- it helps drive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loss of lithium causes the range of Alzheimer's-related changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that feeding healthy mice a lithium-restricted diet brought their brain lithium levels down to a level similar to that in patients with Alzheimer's disease. This appeared to accelerate the aging process, giving rise to brain inflammation, loss of synaptic connections between neurons, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer's mouse models, depleted lithium dramatically accelerated the formation of amyloid-beta plaques and structures that resemble neurofibrillary tangles. Lithium depletion also activated inflammatory cells in the brain called microglia, impairing their ability to degrade amyloid; caused the loss of synapses, axons, and neuron-protecting myelin; and accelerated cognitive decline and memory loss -- all hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mouse experiments further revealed that lithium altered the activity of genes known to raise or lower risk of Alzheimer's, including the most well-known, &lt;em&gt;APOE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replenishing lithium by giving the mice lithium orotate in their water reversed the disease-related damage and restored memory function, even in older mice with advanced disease. Notably, maintaining stable lithium levels in early life prevented Alzheimer's onset -- a finding that confirmed that lithium fuels the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What impresses me the most about lithium is the widespread effect it has on the various manifestations of Alzheimer's. I really have not seen anything quite like it all my years of working on this disease," said Yankner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A promising avenue for Alzheimer's treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few limited clinical trials of lithium for Alzheimer's disease have shown some efficacy, but the lithium compounds they used -- such as the clinical standard, lithium carbonate -- can be toxic to aging people at the high doses normally used in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new research explains why: Amyloid beta was sequestering these other lithium compounds before they could work. Yankner and colleagues found lithium orotate by developing a screening platform that searches a library of compounds for those that might bypass amyloid beta. Other researchers can now use the platform to seek additional amyloid-evading lithium compounds that might be even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the most galvanizing findings for us was that there were profound effects at this exquisitely low dose," Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If replicated in further studies, the researchers say lithium screening through routine blood tests may one day may offer a way to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's who would benefit from treatment to prevent or delay disease onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying lithium levels in people who are resistant to Alzheimer's as they age might help scientists establish a target level that they could help patients maintain to prevent onset of the disease, Yankner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since lithium has not yet been shown to be safe or effective in protecting against neurodegeneration in humans, Yankner emphasizes that people should not take lithium compounds on their own. But he expressed cautious optimism that lithium orotate or a similar compound will move forward into clinical trials in the near future and could ultimately change the story of Alzheimer's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My hope is that lithium will do something more fundamental than anti-amyloid or anti-tau therapies, not just lessening but reversing cognitive decline and improving patients' lives," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

It examined the proportion of people in those couples who had one of nine psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), substance-use disorder and anorexia nervosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists lack a definitive understanding of what causes people to develop psychiatric disorders — but genetics and environmental factors are both thought to play a part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that when one partner was diagnosed with one of the nine conditions, the other was significantly more likely to be diagnosed with the same or another psychiatric condition. Spouses were more likely to have the same conditions than to have different ones, says co-author Chun Chieh Fan, a population and genetics researcher at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research in Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main result is that the pattern holds across countries, across cultures, and, of course, generations,” Fan says. Even changes in psychiatric care over the past 50 years have not shifted the trend, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only OCD, bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa showed different patterns across countries. For instance, in Taiwan, married couples were more likely to share OCD than were couples in Nordic countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study separated people into birth cohorts, from the 1930s to the 1990s, spanning ten-year intervals. For most disorders, the chances of partners sharing a diagnosis increased slightly with each decade, particularly for those with disorders related to substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s behind the trend?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study did not investigate what causes the phenomenon, Fan says three theories could help to explain it. First, people might be attracted to those who resemble them. “Perhaps they better understand each other due to shared suffering, so they attract each other,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, a shared environment could make partners more alike — a process known as convergence. And third, the societal stigma of having a psychiatric disorder narrows a person’s choice of spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jan Fullerton, a psychiatric geneticist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, says that social and environmental stressors could contribute to a new diagnosis in a previously unaffected partner, particularly if they had milder, undiagnosed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Here are some of the biggest ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pale-floating-stool" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Pale, floating stool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you notice your stool is light colored and floating, that's a sign of poor nutrient absorption because of a pancreas malfunction. "The enzymes your pancreas produces help you digest fats in your diet," Dr. Hendifar explained. Along with breaking down fats, your pancreas helps your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins like A, E, and K, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When pancreatic disease messes with your organ's ability to properly manufacture those enzymes, the result is feces that looks paler and is less dense. You may also notice your poop is oily or greasy. "The toilet water will have a film that looks like oil," Dr. Hendifar said. That's the dietary fat your body failed to break down, he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you notice your poop looks funky now and then, that's no reason to freak out. But if all or most of your bowel movements have these characteristics, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="radiating-back-pain" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Radiating back pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Abdominal pain is one of the most common symptoms of both pancreatic cancer and acute pancreatitis, which is a type of deadly inflammation, Dr. Hendifar said. But that pain manifests in different ways depending on the underlying condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If the pain seems to start in your middle before "radiating" into your mid or lower back—and if it lingers for weeks—that may be a sign of pancreatic cancer, Dr. Epperly said. Also, if you've already seen your doctor and he or she has prescribed a type of drug called a proton-pump inhibitor—such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or esomeprazole (Nexium)—let your doc know if your symptoms don't improve. Dr. Hendifar said it's common for doctors to mistake pancreatic cancer–triggered pain for reflux or other GI issues, many of which a proton-pump inhibitor should help resolve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;On the other hand, if the pain comes on suddenly and is intense and focused in the middle of your abdomen, that's the type associated with acute pancreatitis  (sudden, temporary inflammation of the pancreas), Dr. Epperly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, it's important to remember that a &lt;em data-node-id="13.1"&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of health issues—some serious, but many mild—can cause &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20514235/what-it-means-if-you-have-one-of-these-7-types-of-stomach-pains/" target="_self" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20514235/what-it-means-if-you-have-one-of-these-7-types-of-stomach-pains/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stomach aches or pain" data-node-id="13.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;stomach aches or pain&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar added. But if either of the descriptions above sound familiar and you haven't found a way to get relief, it's best to give your doctor a call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="an-unexpected-diabetes-diagnosis" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;An unexpected diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21743-pancreas" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pancreas" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;pancreas&lt;/a&gt; produces hormones like insulin and glucagon that help maintain healthy levels of sugar in your bloodstream. When the pancreas is imperiled, it's common for sufferers to develop &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" target="_self" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a20492087/difference-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="type 2 diabetes" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Hendifar said, because the production of these hormones will be thrown out of whack. If your weight is under control and you eat a healthy diet, a new diabetes diagnosis should lead to a closer examination of your pancreas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The same holds for a diabetes sufferer who suddenly finds her disease harder to manage, even if she is doing all the right things. "Those sudden changes in diabetes status without an obvious explanation, those are things we see associated with pancreatic cancer," Dr. Hendifar said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="nausea-from-high-fat-foods" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Nausea from high-fat foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Nausea and vomiting are symptoms to watch out for—particularly if you've been eating fatty foods, Dr. Hendifar said. Again, because your pancreas produces enzymes that help your digestive system break down fat, diseases that mess with your pancreas tend to disrupt your body's fat-digesting capabilities, which leads to nausea. "Hamburgers are often nausea triggers, and so are avocados and nuts, which are all high in fat," Dr. Hendifar added. "Pizza is another one that's really tough for patients with a compromised pancreas." Dr. Epperly said pancreatitis is more likely than pancreatic cancer to lead to sudden vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="rapid-weight-loss" data-node-id="19" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Rapid weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's tempting to credit your new diet, especially if you're actively trying to lose weight. But if you're shedding weight—and especially if you're experiencing the radiating pain described above—that weight loss could be due to the digestive issues associated with pancreatic cancer or disease, Dr. Hendifar said.
