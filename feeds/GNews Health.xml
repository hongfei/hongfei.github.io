                &lt;p&gt;Talk about the souvenir from hell. A recent case report documents how a woman’s overseas trip to South America left her playing host to a worm parasite stuck in her eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in Chile and elsewhere &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/12/25-1126_article#;"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the eye-opening case last month in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 26-year-old UK resident developed a severe bout of conjunctivitis the scientists traced back to a wriggling adult &lt;em&gt;Philophthalmus lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; fluke—one she probably caught weeks earlier while visiting the Galápagos Islands off Ecuador. Though the worm was safely pulled out of the woman’s eye with no issue, more people in the area could be vulnerable to these infestations, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our clinical and epidemiologic findings show that the zoonotic eye fluke &lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; can infect humans in South America. The findings also suggest that the parasite might be endemic on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A fluke case&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman visited doctors in Santiago, Chile, nine days into having intense pain, swelling, and the sensation of feeling something moving in her right eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a thorough examination, the doctors spotted an “elongated mobile structure” in the conjunctiva of her eye (the thin, clear membrane that protects the eye). They then removed the foreign object by using a moist cotton swab, which relieved the unpleasant eye sensation. In the weeks after, she made a complete recovery with no complications.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors placed the eye intruder under a microscope and determined it was a &lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; fluke, which they further confirmed through genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/fluke-flatworm"&gt;Flukes&lt;/a&gt; are a class of parasitic flatworms formally known as trematodes. They have a complex life cycle that involves multiple hosts, which can include people. In people, fluke infections are typically grouped by where in the body the worms invade, such as the blood or liver. Eye fluke infections are primarily caused by &lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="eujQNb" data-processed="true"&gt;Philophthalmus &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;worms like &lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re only rarely reported. Since 1939, the researchers wrote, only 12 other cases of similar infections have been documented in the medical literature.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; worms have been found in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Their final, definitive hosts (the hosts where they reach maturity and mate) are waterbirds, and their intermediate hosts are marine snails. Sometimes, however, the worms can infect other vertebrates like mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A hidden endemic threat?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this specific case, the woman reported visiting Chile, Ecuador, and Peru prior to her symptoms starting. But the only time she was in a natural water environment was when she visited the Galápagos Islands. So that’s the most likely place where she contracted the infection, the doctors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exactly how it happened remains a mystery. Some case reports indicate that people can catch the infection through direct contact with larval cysts in the water while swimming, according to the researchers, yet others have linked infection to eating or handling food contaminated with the larva.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We know very little about these worms, including how many distinct species of &lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="eujQNb" data-processed="true"&gt;Philophthalmus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/i&gt;there are in the world. And interestingly enough, the worm found in the woman’s eye bears a close resemblance to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16108555/"&gt;recently discovered species&lt;/a&gt; of fluke found in sea lions living near the Galápagos Islands called &lt;em&gt;P. zalophi&lt;/em&gt;. So close, in fact, it’s possible that &lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;P. zalophi&lt;/em&gt; are the exact same species, the researchers argue. Flukes are known to physically adapt to their mammalian hosts, they note, which could explain why scientists might have mistakenly identified the sea lion worms as a new species.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However many kinds of these worms there are, it seems likely that some call the Galápagos Islands home. So more research needs to be done to better understand the ecology and host range of these flukes, the researchers say. And while human infections do seem to be rare, people who experience eye trouble after traveling to potentially endemic regions should at least be aware of the possibility, as should the doctors treating them.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The consequences for travelers and physicians attending them is that they should consider philophthalmiasis if people complain about a foreign body sensation during or after travel,” lead author Thomas Weitzel, a tropical medicine and parasitology expert at the Universidad del Desarrollo in Chile, told Gizmodo. “The treatment is the extraction of the worm which should be done by an ophthalmologist.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m just thrilled to know there are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/eyeworms"&gt;even more awful things&lt;/a&gt; that can set up shop inside my juicy eyes if given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

There are currently 200 people in quarantine, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The outbreak has been ongoing as state health officials continue to push for vaccinations. The majority of cases are located around Spartanburg County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The number of those in quarantine does not reflect the number actually exposed," Dr. Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist, said in a press releases. "An increasing number of public exposure sites are being identified with likely hundreds more people exposed who are not aware they should be in quarantine if they are not immune to measles. Previous measles transmission studies have shown that one measles case can result in up to 20 new infections among unvaccinated contacts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;South Carolina's department of public health said it sent a statewide health alert on Jan. 7, "advising health care providers and facilities of the importance of heightened awareness for measles and recommended measures for the use of masks and rapid isolation of suspect measles cases to protect people in health care settings from exposures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that people receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, CDC data shows vaccination rates have been lagging in recent years. During the 2024-2025 school year, 92.5% of kindergartners received the MMR vaccine, according to data. This is lower than the 92.7% seen the previous school year and the 95.2% seen in the 2019-2020 school year, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;ABC News' Mary Kekatos contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>abcnews.go.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:17:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPaF9OTEZvVVBnVkd0VW10LXFtSDFGWEM0R3F0d2JxSGpocnBVWUF3MUNQQWJnX2syVXlZREFuRmZySXR3TVczQmw4ajNBYVFPSVFNbFRDMnJBWEFmbU9KRjNzSF9QZ0V0blZ2YmV0bmtQQy1feVFPV2tKTHNsNkpmT3RLOVo4MWxBdHlqZ0VSX2FjTmdIR2840gGcAUFVX3lxTE5KeTgxak50UjluQm9qdXA2b0NCeXlDNUxPTDdWVDYxZFgzd1huc2IxUWRTN0ZwNUMwZVY0MTVYN2dvX2dmS3BOSGJ6ZXBralVVcW9Vd1pyUy1tZDBjaTk1aTBQZEZXdEdSMjVDWHh3NkJzcEtkY042MU9FeFNaRDc3UEhPeWc5YWw3YVNIekpuUjhPUVlmV2ZxT3Zyeg</guid></item><item><title>核磁共振成像中的性行为：改变医学对人体的理解方式的实验- Ynetnews</title><link>https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/sjxjxor4wg</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-contents="true"&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="bpsdt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bpsdt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bpsdt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In 1991, a woman and her partner entered an MRI scanner and had sex in the name of science.

They happened to know the right people at the right time. Their close friend, Dutch scientist Menno Victor “Pek” van Andel, wanted to answer a basic question that had barely been studied: what the anatomy of sexual intercourse actually looks like from the inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="8mc2j-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8mc2j-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8mc2j-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He asked the couple to take part. To his surprise, they agreed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="cbm0k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cbm0k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cbm0k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Inside the narrow, noisy MRI scanner, the couple were instructed to maintain a fixed position while the system captured a series of relatively slow scans lasting several seconds each. The conditions were far from comfortable, but the results were clear. For the first time, medicine could observe in real time how sexual organs align and function during intercourse, documentation that had never previously existed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="7tup2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7tup2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7tup2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Following the initial experiment, researchers conducted a structured study that systematically examined the anatomy of sex using MRI technology. Volunteers aged 18 and older took part in 13 scans involving eight couples and three women, imaged both during intercourse and during sexual arousal without penetration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="bra2h-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bra2h-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bra2h-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;All scans were conducted in the missionary position, and participants were free to stop at any point. None did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="dub7g-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dub7g-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dub7g-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The findings, published in 1999 in the British Medical Journal, challenged a number of long-held medical assumptions. One central discovery overturned the centuries-old belief that the penis moves in and out of the vagina in a straight line, a depiction found in early anatomical illustrations, including a famous 1492 drawing by Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="f7r73-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f7r73-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f7r73-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The MRI images showed a very different reality. During erection, the penis curves inside the woman’s body and adapts to her anatomy in a natural motion that does not cause pain. Researchers likened the shape to a boomerang. They also discovered that about one-third of the penis consists of a “root” that remains inside the body even when flaccid, a fact previously unknown to medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="dapqq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dapqq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dapqq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Unexpected findings emerged regarding the female body as well. During sexual arousal without penetration, researchers observed the uterus shifting upward and the front wall of the vagina lengthening. Contrary to earlier theories, there was no increase in uterine volume. These observations contradicted classical anatomy textbooks and highlighted how much medical knowledge about female sexuality had long been based on assumptions rather than direct observation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="3rft6-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="ck6nq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ck6nq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ck6nq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Another surprising finding was that in all 13 cases, the woman’s bladder filled rapidly during intercourse. Researchers have yet to reach a definitive explanation. Van Andel suggested it may be “evolution’s way of encouraging women to urinate after sex to prevent urinary tract infections,” though he stressed this remains a theoretical idea without scientific proof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="5ta4o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5ta4o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5ta4o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“In every final scan, we saw a large, full bladder, even though most women had used the restroom before entering the MRI,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="elmdg-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="elmdg-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="elmdg-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Although the article was published on Christmas Eve in 1999, when most researchers were on holiday, it became one of the most read and cited papers in the journal’s history. In 2019, 20 years after publication, BMJ editors singled it out as one of the most unusual and influential studies the journal had ever published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="abtpl-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="abtpl-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="abtpl-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;More than 26 years later, the article is still read by thousands each month and remains among the most popular papers in the journal’s history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="96tlb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="96tlb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="96tlb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In recent years, the story has found new life on social media. A TikTok video featuring the MRI images sparked astonishment, with users questioning how two people fit inside such a narrow machine and noting how loud MRIs are. “How is there room?” one user asked. “Anyone who’s had an MRI knows how intense it is,” another wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="eh8s9-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.SJgGkYiCEbg" id="image_ArticleImageData.SJgGkYiCEbg"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SJgGkYiCEbg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/07/BJmzdci4Zl/BJmzdci4Zl_0_2_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="מכשיר MRI" title="An MRI machine  (Photo: shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SJgGkYiCEbg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/07/BJmzdci4Zl/BJmzdci4Zl_0_2_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="מכשיר MRI" title="An MRI machine  (Photo: shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;An MRI machine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="dcrni-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dcrni-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dcrni-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Sabelis addressed the reactions herself in a recent interview on the podcast “What Was It Like.” “The magnets are very, very loud, but we managed,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="23nm1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="23nm1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="23nm1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;She also said she never expected the experiment to have such a lasting impact. “This was one of the first MRI machines, so capturing the images took time,” she said. “From the next room, they told us to stay in the same position for maybe a minute.

While medication can help, simple lifestyle changes can also go far toward lowering blood pressure.

Below, discover what the study found, how a cardiologist and registered dietitian interpret the findings, and whether you should start sipping beet juice as part of your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65935582/top-foods-for-heart-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-padma-shenoy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Padma Shenoy, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Padma Shenoy, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and LabFinder.com contributor and &lt;a href="https://www.citytoseanutrition.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of City to Sea Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the small randomized double-blind crossover study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584925008068" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Free Radical Biology and Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Free Radical Biology and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;researchers linked beetroot juice consumption with lowered blood pressure in older adults. Over three two-week trial periods (with two week breaks in between each one), study participants were instructed to either drink nitrate-rich beet juice or a placebo beet juice twice daily or rinse their mouths with mouthwash twice daily for 30 seconds, aside from the last day, which prompted one final drink or rinse. The beet juice and placebo drinkers did not use mouthwash during their assigned juice-drinking periods. Participants were divided into two demographics—younger adults (aged between 18 and 30) and older adults (aged between 67 to 79). There were 42 young adults and 36 older adults, making for a small, combined cohort of 78 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to analyze how bacterial changes within the oral microbiome may influence blood pressure levels. So, researchers monitored both the whole time. Participants were not medicated for any pulmonary, cardiovascular, or metabolic conditions, nor did they have ulcerative colitis, renal disease, or active oral disease or dentures. People who smoked and people with stage 2 hypertension or those who had used antibiotics within three months prior to the study were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The testing began after an overnight fast and the avoidance of strenuous exercise, alcohol, and caffeine for 24 hours. Other than drinking their assigned drink (70 milliliters of beet juice or placebo morning and evening, or that 30-second twice-daily rinse), participants proceeded normally with all their other habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the three trials were compared, researchers concluded that drinking beetroot juice may help lower blood pressure in older adults (the blood pressure-lowering effect was not seen in the younger group). According to &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-padma-shenoy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Padma Shenoy, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Padma Shenoy, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and LabFinder.com contributor, this was “likely by changing the composition of bacteria in the mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, researchers discovered that drinking beet juice led to “a decrease in certain bacteria (like Prevotella) and an increase in others (such as Neisseria and Rothia) that are better at converting dietary nitrate into nitric oxide, a compound that helps blood vessels relax,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.citytoseanutrition.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of City to Sea Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does beet juice lower blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened in the study seems to be based on the relationship between nitrates, blood pressure, and the oral microbiome. &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90/BEHRP_Food+Safety_Nitrates+and+Food+Safety_ENG_03272024.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;amp;CONVERT_TO=url&amp;amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_K9I401S01H7F40QBNJU3SO1F56-a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90-pqHU0Xc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nitrates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nitrates&lt;/a&gt; are chemicals found naturally in the environment, vegetables, and preserved meats. With the help of the aforementioned bacteria that live in the mouth, dietary nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which can improve heart health by relaxing blood vessels and boosting blood flow, said Dr. Shenoy. In fact, nitrates are commonly found in blood pressure-controlling medications, she added. “That’s why diets high in nitrate-rich vegetables, like spinach, arugula, and beets, are consistently linked with better vascular health,” concluded Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question mark hanging over these findings is the role of the oral microbiome, but it does appear to have one. “We are still learning about the connection between the oral microbiome and blood pressure, but it is possible that certain bacteria in the mouth could turn nutrients into substances that lower blood pressure,” Dr. Shenoy explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have previously heard of concerns regarding &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/chemical_exposures/nitrate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excess nitrate consumption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;excess nitrate consumption&lt;/a&gt; and the potential cancer risk associated with it. Those concerns are largely linked to processed food (like deli meats and cheeses) and water sources with added nitrates that aim to prevent bacteria growth and improve food’s taste and color. Naturally occurring nitrates in vegetables are considered safe to eat (and are found in some of the healthiest foods, like leafy greens, beets, and celery). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you try it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to this study, only older adults experienced a slight drop in blood pressure from drinking beetroot juice, and more studies are needed to explore which individuals will respond,” said Dr. Shenoy. “Eating more vegetables like beetroot may help heart health, but it is important to remember that is just one part of a healthy lifestyle. More research is needed to support strong recommendations to consume beetroot as a blood-pressure lowering therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it does not appear that drinking beet juice will hinder your efforts to lower your blood pressure, Dr. Shenoy stressed that it's only one tool in your toolbox. "Other components of a heart-healthy lifestyle include eating a varied diet, limiting sodium intake, and exercising regularly," she said. The combination of these healthy choices—plus personalized recommendations from your physician—will have the largest effect on your blood pressure and heart health overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 14:14:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPSVZsYkNvZURWYXJiMTdoakhISHVtZ0lnaFllQnNkOEN4Wlp6QVlGbUpTTDJlQzNoOWtkVDE3SXllNnFkbmhNU3BTSUVHNGE4MVZfdi16d29HQWRPeTc1dGsxQlREdkNodGNuMnJTWHBuUWZOOVFZcnI5RWg2aU9XREkwLVNUWVZ0M3c</guid></item><item><title>我把声音看作形状。通感赋予了我非凡的语言能力--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/10/auditory-visual-synaesthesia-languages</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ar journeys with my partner are a nightmare. He’s an ex-DJ so he likes to crank the music up, but for me this means seeing static images and flashes of light in my mind’s eye while I’m trying to drive. It’s hard to describe exactly what I see when I hear sound. But it’s almost like the sound waves you’d see if you watched an audio recording on a screen, or these little neurons connecting and space nebulas exploding in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’m 44 now and only realised I had auditory-visual synaesthesia in my 30s. What I did know was that I seemed to have an extraordinary ability for linguistics. In school I studied Japanese and did really well without trying because I could literally see the words and sounds presented as images in front of me, making them easy to remember. At university I majored in Spanish, Korean and Indonesian and it was no effort at all. I then joined the air force as an intelligence officer because I didn’t want to become a teacher or translator. I walked away from the language aptitude test thinking I’d either messed it up or that it had been the easiest thing I’d ever done in my life. No one’s ever managed to get every answer right, they said when the results came back. But I hadn’t even tried. It just came naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7bdf26c2-a1fe-4d86-8150-a5147c09bbf1" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":2,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I taste words. ‘Bob’ is like a milk chocolate Easter egg on my tongue","elementId":"7bdf26c2-a1fe-4d86-8150-a5147c09bbf1","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/02/i-taste-words-lexical-gustatory-synaesthesia"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The first time I heard the word synaesthesia was when I decided to work in speech pathology after leaving the military. I started learning about autism spectrum disorder and various forms of neurodivergence, and read about this phenomenon called synaesthesia, in which stimulation of one sense leads to automatic experiences in a second sense. I didn’t make any connection to my own experiences but began reading a book about a man who could learn languages in a matter of hours. Still, I didn’t make the connection. I just thought it was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It wasn’t until I started doing speech-to-text computational linguistic work that I started really thinking about the fact that I was seeing these shapes when I heard sounds or phonemes. I found a Facebook group full of people who saw sounds too, though they all saw sounds as colours whereas mine are all black and white shapes. The only time I see colour is when I hear high-frequency sounds, which start as bright white then move through the scale of yellows to oranges to reds. I’ve always been able to pass hearing tests at ridiculously quiet decibels because I see the pure tones as different coloured flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="861f071e-c525-4f23-aedc-b41d0f45b783" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘My brain feels busy pretty much constantly thanks to the noisy world we live in.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One day I was working as an assistant transcribing Indigenous creole languages for Wollongong University when my supervisor put me in touch with the head linguist for Apple. She was looking for someone really good with phonetics, who would be free to go to Japan for 90 days to work on a new speech-to-text project. On day one of the job I found out I’d been chosen to work on Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I spent a lot of time in headphones over those next 90 days, as they recorded Australian voices and I sat in. I loved it and I’ve loved pretty much every work-day since. I’ve done speech-to-text projects for Tom Tom GPS and Bank of America, and a lot of my day-to-day work now is as a speech pathologist, helping children and adults to communicate and swallow better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’m not worried about the rise of AI because language is incredibly nuanced and robots simply aren’t good enough to pick up those subtleties. I can break down the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/25/its-an-expression-of-identity-the-tiktoker-taking-the-western-sydney-accent-to-the-world" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;western Sydney Lebanese accent&lt;/a&gt; in an instant. I wouldn’t trust AI to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My form of synaesthesia comes with its challenges. I wear a lot of earplugs to block out the sound around me, and my brain feels busy pretty much constantly thanks to the noisy world we live in. Running to music is my favourite way to switch off. It’s the only time I don’t see sound and my brain is quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of that said, I wouldn’t change my synaesthesia for a second. I could lose my sight and cut my arms off, but if I couldn’t work with words and sounds it would destroy me. I feel so lucky that I found this field of work when I did, and I’ll keep going until I’m 80 if I can. It feels like my reason for being – my &lt;em&gt;ikigai&lt;/em&gt;, they call it in Japanese. I’d do it for free if I didn’t have bills to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 14:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPUFBJNmk4SUh3NkJIeEs2aVVnbWNkNWRDZ2FhMU9TU0VYYkVTSTVFQ3Ixb1pBQVpSZ24yVzI5dmdnSW1xYWlhSTl2UThYcTFyd0RGRlJVYnFycEdQbUc3TGo3THlFRDgtd2I0ekNDZGNsQ280NEE2SXp4UjIwS3Z0RzJYZWQ1WE9aenRod2VhRTFlZE5hdGc</guid></item><item><title>尊敬的医生：什么类型的食物和饮料会减缓您身体对糖分的吸收？ - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://www.oregonlive.com/advice/2026/01/dear-doctor-what-type-of-foods-drinks-slow-down-your-bodys-absorption-of-sugar.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OKMUIH3Q3ZEFVL6QGFM25MDJYY"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I am a generally healthy 70-year-old man, and I like to drink orange juice -- the kind that is freshly squeezed with no additives but is pasteurized. I also like to eat strawberries almost every day. My recent A1C and glucose levels were 6% and 110 mg/dL, respectively. My prior year readings were 5.5% and 100 mg/dL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LJJGUCRYWZGMDPAKHBRZSAVY5A"&gt;I’ve read that ingesting natural sugars is OK because they slow down the absorption and digestion rates, but I wonder what your thoughts are on this. Should I be cutting out strawberries and orange juice altogether? -- M.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4SR3Z3NSBZAS5H6F6WZJG5G3QE"&gt;ANSWER: It is true that eating whole fruit slows the absorption of sugar, so oranges would be much better for your blood sugar than orange juice, no matter how fresh it is or whether it has additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CLMD6UWR4VGXDMOSNJNWTIHPFQ"&gt;Orange juice contains three different sugars: sucrose, glucose and fructose. It is roughly half sucrose and 25% of glucose and fructose each. Your body can’t tell a molecule of fructose or sucrose from orange juice apart from those that come from high fructose corn syrup in a can of soda. (For example, Coca-Cola in the United States is a mixture of 55% sucrose and 45% glucose.) These sugars get absorbed quickly -- about twice as quickly as the sugar in whole oranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QPYLZSBHBZGZ7IBDIJ7GXC3DPA"&gt;Strawberries are an even better choice than whole oranges. The polyphenols and fiber in strawberries slow sugar absorption, giving your body more time to raise insulin levels to keep your blood sugar under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4W3NHCVJVJG7JO7XZZMW5A7WPA"&gt;Having other food at the same time can also help. Fats and proteins slow down sugar and other carbohydrate absorption, so I often see people adding some nuts, like almonds or walnuts, to their fruit snack or meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OO5BUUGYQBEZVF7PRYH6FDQMNQ"&gt;I also enjoy a glass of fresh orange juice, but I make it small and occasional, which is good advice for people who are trying to manage their blood sugars, especially when you are trying to prevent prediabetes (an A1C above 5.7% and below 6.5%) from becoming diabetes (6.5% or higher).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. I am a 67-year-old female, and before this, I was at the osteopenia level for several years. The treatment that is being recommended to me is an IV treatment called Reclast. I have never heard of this before and would like your take on it. -- K.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UIDRSGD2LJBIHCNGAOHU33AT6Q"&gt;ANSWER: Osteopenia and osteoporosis are both conditions where bones lose minerals and strength. This can be an age-related process in both women and men or may be as a result of an underlying condition. Some medications (especially steroids like prednisone), hormonal abnormalities, nutritional disorders, and bone marrow disease can be underlying causes of osteoporosis and should be considered prior to therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T342XE4WUVH6XO7HYV5LNHLZCA"&gt;For most women with age-related osteoporosis, the decision to begin therapy starts with the fracture risk, which can be estimated via the FRAX score once the bone density is known. For those who decide on therapy, medications to slow the excess bone reabsorption that is the hallmark of age-related osteoporosis is usually the first-line treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XSEWCSTBHBGU3G7NQHQYQHGSPA"&gt;You have probably heard of alendronate (Fosamax) or ibandrobate (Boniva), and zoledronic acid (Reclast) is in the same class called bisphosphonates. It has a major advantage for some people when dosed intravenously (which avoids the possibility of damage to the stomach or esophagus) every year, or sometimes every two years. Bone density is monitored carefully, and most people are on these drugs for three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7H75ETHVNRB27HF2ROGC4WHXHQ"&gt;Many readers have heard of bad side effects from bisphosphonate drugs, but when used correctly, they reduce the risk of hip and spine fractures, which are life-changing events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DHPDVA2RL5CMJBOWETJ44BQNPQ"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

Over three two-week trial periods (with two week breaks in between each one), study participants were instructed to either drink nitrate-rich beet juice or a placebo beet juice twice daily or rinse their mouths with mouthwash twice daily for 30 seconds, aside from the last day, which prompted one final drink or rinse. The beet juice and placebo drinkers did not use mouthwash during their assigned juice-drinking periods. Participants were divided into two demographics—younger adults (aged between 18 and 30) and older adults (aged between 67 to 79). There were 42 young adults and 36 older adults, making for a small, combined cohort of 78 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The goal was to analyze how bacterial changes within the oral microbiome may influence blood pressure levels. So, researchers monitored both the whole time. Participants were not medicated for any pulmonary, cardiovascular, or metabolic conditions, nor did they have ulcerative colitis, renal disease, or active oral disease or dentures. People who smoked and people with stage 2 hypertension or those who had used antibiotics within three months prior to the study were also excluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The testing began after an overnight fast and the avoidance of strenuous exercise, alcohol, and caffeine for 24 hours. Other than drinking their assigned drink (70 milliliters of beet juice or placebo morning and evening, or that 30-second twice-daily rinse), participants proceeded normally with all their other habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;After the three trials were compared, researchers concluded that drinking beetroot juice may help lower blood pressure in older adults (the blood pressure-lowering effect was not seen in the younger group). According to &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-padma-shenoy/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-padma-shenoy/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Padma Shenoy, M.D" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Padma Shenoy, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and LabFinder.com contributor, this was “likely by changing the composition of bacteria in the mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;More specifically, researchers discovered that drinking beet juice led to “a decrease in certain bacteria (like Prevotella) and an increase in others (such as Neisseria and Rothia) that are better at converting dietary nitrate into nitric oxide, a compound that helps blood vessels relax,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.citytoseanutrition.com/about" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.citytoseanutrition.com/about" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N." data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of City to Sea Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-beet-juice-lower-blood-pressure" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;How does beet juice lower blood pressure? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;What happened in the study seems to be based on the relationship between nitrates, blood pressure, and the oral microbiome. &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90/BEHRP_Food+Safety_Nitrates+and+Food+Safety_ENG_03272024.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;amp;CONVERT_TO=url&amp;amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_K9I401S01H7F40QBNJU3SO1F56-a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90-pqHU0Xc" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90/BEHRP_Food+Safety_Nitrates+and+Food+Safety_ENG_03272024.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;amp;CONVERT_TO=url&amp;amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_K9I401S01H7F40QBNJU3SO1F56-a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90-pqHU0Xc" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nitrates" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Nitrates&lt;/a&gt; are chemicals found naturally in the environment, vegetables, and preserved meats. With the help of the aforementioned bacteria that live in the mouth, dietary nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which can improve heart health by relaxing blood vessels and boosting blood flow, said Dr. Shenoy. In fact, nitrates are commonly found in blood pressure-controlling medications, she added. “That’s why diets high in nitrate-rich vegetables, like spinach, arugula, and beets, are consistently linked with better vascular health,” concluded Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The question mark hanging over these findings is the role of the oral microbiome, but it does appear to have one. “We are still learning about the connection between the oral microbiome and blood pressure, but it is possible that certain bacteria in the mouth could turn nutrients into substances that lower blood pressure,” Dr. Shenoy explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You may have previously heard of concerns regarding &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/chemical_exposures/nitrate" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/chemical_exposures/nitrate" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="excess nitrate consumption" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;excess nitrate consumption&lt;/a&gt; and the potential cancer risk associated with it. Those concerns are largely linked to processed food (like deli meats and cheeses) and water sources with added nitrates that aim to prevent bacteria growth and improve food’s taste and color. Naturally occurring nitrates in vegetables are considered safe to eat (and are found in some of the healthiest foods, like leafy greens, beets, and celery). &lt;br data-node-id="13.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="should-you-try-it" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;Should you try it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“According to this study, only older adults experienced a slight drop in blood pressure from drinking beetroot juice, and more studies are needed to explore which individuals will respond,” said Dr. Shenoy. “Eating more vegetables like beetroot may help heart health, but it is important to remember that is just one part of a healthy lifestyle. More research is needed to support strong recommendations to consume beetroot as a blood-pressure lowering therapy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While it does not appear that drinking beet juice will hinder your efforts to lower your blood pressure, Dr. Shenoy stressed that it's only one tool in your toolbox. "Other components of a heart-healthy lifestyle include eating a varied diet, limiting sodium intake, and exercising regularly," she said. The combination of these healthy choices—plus personalized recommendations from your physician—will have the largest effect on your blood pressure and heart health overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNakZlNVBnalZXN2ZvV3BSRTdsVUZsQVJoYWtfaVFBX1llRXViZjEwQ0M4ZlpiT2xkSURaeXdxSV90WTdRVGRDcXJhTWdNSk9XbndXWkFYX3VXeWNCZjFUak02UlNNd0lmVWQ4T1gyMUN4aGlzYjZXbjBMRUl6RlBkQUNjdnVTNm9NTHJj</guid></item><item><title>危险的“抗药性”超级细菌引起了德克萨斯州各地的关注- MySA</title><link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/superbug-texas-21276946.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Symptoms usually appear about two weeks after infection and include high fever, runny nose, dry cough, red eyes, and a characteristic rash that begins on the face and spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="section-11" class="article-paragraph-wrap"&gt;&lt;p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph"&gt;Most patients recover within days, but serious complications can occur, especially in infants, pregnant women, and people with weakened immunity.

Children under six are vaccinated at Tipat Halav clinics, while children aged 7 and older and adults receive vaccinations through their health funds. Unvaccinated individuals or those with only one dose should complete the series if at least four weeks have passed since the last dose.

			&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks and strokes rarely occur without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to health data from more than 9 million adults in South Korea and the US, nearly everyone who develops heart disease and suffers a major cardiovascular event has one of four major risk factors in the lead-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar levels, and tobacco smoking (past or current).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nearly-half-of-all-heart-attacks-may-be-missed-by-current-screening-tools"&gt;Nearly Half of All Heart Attacks May Be Missed by Current Screening Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined as a group, they preceded 99 percent of all cardiovascular events during the long-term study, which was published in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176016" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/mm6805a2_Heart-Attack-Awareness-VA1200x675-medium.jpg" alt="CDC Heart Attack" class="size-full wp-image-176016" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/mm6805a2_Heart-Attack-Awareness-VA1200x675-medium.jpg 635w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/mm6805a2_Heart-Attack-Awareness-VA1200x675-medium-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176016" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Recognizing the imminent signs of a heart attack could save lives.

In both the US and South Korea, more than 93 percent of individuals who experienced a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure had hypertension beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing this risk factor could, therefore, be key to preventing serious cardiovascular disease down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the study shows very convincingly that exposure to one or more nonoptimal risk factors before these cardiovascular outcomes is nearly 100 percent," senior author and &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/09/nearly-everyone-has-at-least-one-risk-factor-before-a-heart-attack-stroke-or-heart-failure"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cardiologist Philip Greenland from Northwestern University &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/09/nearly-everyone-has-at-least-one-risk-factor-before-a-heart-attack-stroke-or-heart-failure"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in September when the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal now is to work harder on finding ways to control these modifiable risk factors rather than to get off track in pursuing other factors that are not easily treatable and not causal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenland and his co-authors note that their results challenge &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.06.045"&gt;recent claims&lt;/a&gt; that insidious cardiovascular events occurring in the absence of risk factors are increasing, suggesting that previous studies may have missed diagnoses or overlooked risk factor levels that were below the clinical diagnostic threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-protein-is-a-better-predictor-of-heart-disease-than-cholesterol"&gt;One Protein Is a Better Predictor of Heart Disease Than Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.030"&gt;&lt;span&gt;editorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Duke University cardiologist Neha Pagidipati (who was not involved in the study) argues that the results show just how important it is to manage health risks before they lead to serious, potentially fatal outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can – and must – do better," she &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.030"&gt;&lt;span&gt;writes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.014"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            U.S. officials are building a case that ongoing measles &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/measles-cases-south-carolina-rise-by-nine-185-state-health-department-says-2026-01-02/" target="_blank"&gt;outbreaks in South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and other states are unrelated to last year’s major outbreak in Texas, as it tries to retain its status of having eliminated the disease after recording the highest number of confirmed infections in three decades.

            To be considered measles-free by the World Health Organization, a country must have no locally transmitted cases of the same strain for 12 months or longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66pid800003b6sxik24uoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists studying the issue say the elimination assessment may not be ironclad as it is difficult to be certain that all cases potentially linked to the Texas outbreak have been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qezm000d3b6s5it2ekm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A large outbreak of measles in Texas kicked off 2025 in January and spread to several states, followed by large outbreaks along the Arizona-Utah border and in South Carolina that continue to cause infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qezm000e3b6sl7pyk34m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In November, the Pan American Health Organization - part of the WHO - determined that Canada had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/canada-has-lost-its-measles-elimination-status-says-ottawa-2025-11-10/" target="_blank"&gt;lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; after nearly three decades due to its failure to curb a year-long outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qeqp000b3b6suaskfzy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PAHO this year will evaluate U.S. measles data, which involves 2,065 confirmed cases, to see if it can keep the measles elimination status it has had since 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qlve000j3b6scr4dvlm9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Former U.S. public health officials have described measles elimination status as a key indicator of a nation’s health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qlve000k3b6st2ptaaog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States will have to prove the ongoing measles cases are not related to the Texas outbreak, and were instead brought into the country from infected travelers, said William Moss, an epidemiology professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qlve000l3b6ssh6tzpwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State public health officials have used traditional methods of interviewing infected individuals to identify chains of transmission, as well as comparing the viral genotype - a section of the virus’ DNA - to see if cases are related. That still may not be sufficient to link cases in a large outbreak, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qlhh000h3b6seq4hhuzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kelly Oakeson, who leads next-generation sequencing at the Utah Public Health Laboratory, said none of the patients interviewed in Utah mentioned travel to Texas or contact with people from Texas, but many gave incomplete information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qsk6000r3b6sy69hokj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Based on the state’s detailed genetic analysis, however, he said the Utah strain is “different enough” from the Texas outbreak to suggest they are unrelated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qsk6000s3b6skyhndgji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t think there is a direct link,” he said in an email, adding that the state has been working with CDC, Texas and Arizona to characterize transmission patterns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qsk6000t3b6sf9d3do7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been analyzing the entire genetic code of virus samples to determine if the outbreaks are related, a newer technique that has not traditionally been used to assess measles transmission.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qs7t000p3b6s7ganosrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early evidence from the CDC analysis, which has not been made public, suggests the outbreaks are not related, according to two sources who have seen the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o2000y3b6sdddgub0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a December 5 &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1996961704417046752" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on X, CDC Acting Director Jim O’Neill said there was no epidemiological evidence linking the Texas outbreak and the ongoing cases in South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o2000z3b6shrouql19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A U.S. Health and Human Services spokesman confirmed that the CDC has found no epidemiological evidence linking ongoing outbreaks to Texas, but said many recent U.S. cases share the same genotype and have no known source of infection, “which could indicate ongoing domestic transmission.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200113b6sy15hbtpf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Noel Brewer, an infectious disease doctor at the University of North Carolina who has seen the CDC data, said the preliminary evidence suggests that new cases in Texas stopped in July and there was a three-week gap before the Utah-Arizona outbreak began.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200123b6sgrrbov76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No cases linked the two outbreaks in any clear way,” said Brewer, who chairs an independent committee that will analyze the U.S. data and make a report to PAHO on whether it agrees with the U.S. assessment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200133b6skqs69ysv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s inability to link the outbreaks, Brewer said, may simply reflect that the virus is circulating broadly in the United States and that it is “not possible at this time to track all of the cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200143b6secvaq8zj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are many gaps in epidemiological knowledge in the U.S. outbreaks and not all cases are identified or reported, said Johns Hopkins’ Moss, so you can miss cases linking two outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200153b6sgt7ygao2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, many of the larger U.S. outbreaks are occurring in communities that don’t trust the public health system and may be less likely to report cases or participate in an investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200163b6s353evx26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That could lead scientists to incorrectly conclude that two viruses are different when it was just a sampling problem, Moss said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200173b6sob3j505y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former CDC director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases who quit in August over &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/do-no-harm-why-three-cdc-officials-left-over-vaccine-policy-2025-08-28/" target="_blank"&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; about U.S. vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said PAHO will make the call based on the evidence it receives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200183b6sdjy9o869@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If they don’t believe in the strength of one part of the data, and there are other compelling factors that say that the U.S. has lost elimination, it means that the U.S. has lost elimination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The virus is below flu rates, but certainly still infecting people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re still seeing a fair amount of COVID, kind of that background level with a little bit of a winter uptick as well,” Loafman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playforth added that COVID rates in kids at her practice are increasing, but are low overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Daniel de la Hoz via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daniel de la Hoz via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;By far, flu is the most prevalent winter virus infecting people right now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has been a surprisingly light season for respiratory syncytial virus. And one possibility is that ... we’re on our third year now with an effective vaccination against RSV,” said Martinello. “Especially in kids, there’s some thought that getting that vaccine out there has really made a dent in how this winter virus impacts the population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean the virus isn’t circulating at all, though. According to Playforth, there are “increasing numbers of RSV” among her patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC data shows that RSV isn’t infecting people at anywhere near the same rate as flu. Instead, RSV rates are currently low across the country, but hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are on the rise" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695c230ce4b0908b04a43f01" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Cold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also higher levels of the viruses that cause the common cold, said Martinello, “but not to the degree that we’ve seen increases with flu.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes rhinovirus, Loafman said, which is the virus that most often causes colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cold symptoms generally don’t bring people to the hospital. So it’s not surprising that a fairly high rate of influenza positive is showing up on our testing,” Loafman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to go get tested for the flu (or COVID) if they’re having more severe symptoms, while “people with just a common cold are tending to tough that out at home on their own,” Loafman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are straightforward ways to protect yourself from the circulating winter illnesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wish so much that there was a magic solution to help prevent all these illnesses,” Playforth said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There isn’t any one way to stay healthy all winter long, but there are things you can do to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from these viruses. &lt;/span&gt;First, it’s not too late for the flu shot.

			&lt;p&gt;A study in mice by researchers from Stanford University has traced the loss of cartilage that comes with aging to a single protein, pointing to treatments that may one day restore mobility and ease discomfort in seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein 15-PGDH has previously been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41573-025-00209-5"&gt;extensively linked to aging&lt;/a&gt;: it becomes more abundant as we get older, and interferes with the molecules that repair tissue and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led scientists to consider whether 15-PGDH might be involved in osteoarthritis, where stress on joints leads to the breakdown &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"&gt;of collagen&lt;/a&gt; in cartilage, causing inflammation and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/arthritis-affects-thousands-of-kids-and-one-piece-of-advice-is-crucial"&gt;Arthritis Affects Thousands of Kids, And One Piece of Advice Is Crucial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests on old mice, knee cartilage that had previously worn down thickened following the introduction of a 15-PGDH inhibitor. In similar tests on young, injured mice, the inhibitor offered protection against the usual effects of injury-induced osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers triggered the equivalent of an anterior cruciate ligament injury in mice and subsequently applied the treatment, osteoarthritis didn't develop, as would normally be expected in these kinds of mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts at cartilage regeneration included the use of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="187978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, a factor that was no longer necessary when 15-PGDH was inhibited. Instead, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte"&gt;the chondrocyte cells&lt;/a&gt; that make and maintain cartilage were being transformed into a healthier, more useful state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a new way of regenerating adult tissue, and it has significant clinical promise for treating arthritis due to aging or injury," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/joint-cartilage-aging-osteoarthritis-therapy-research"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; microbiologist Helen Blau. "We were looking for stem cells, but they are clearly not involved. It's very exciting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187981" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/MouseScans.jpg" alt="Cartilage scans" class="wp-image-187981 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/MouseScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/MouseScans-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187981" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Treated aged cartilage (far right, stained red) looked much more like young, healthy cartilage (far left, stained red). (Singla et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treated mice had a steadier gait, suggesting they were experiencing less pain, and were shown putting more weight on their injured legs – signs that the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-have-a-hidden-salamander-like-ability-to-regenerate-body-tissue"&gt;cartilage restoration&lt;/a&gt; equated improved physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same experiment was also tried on human tissue samples taken from people having knee replacement surgery. Again, there were clear signs of regeneration, with the cartilage getting stiffer and showing fewer signs of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mechanism is quite striking and really shifted our perspective about how tissue regeneration can occur," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/joint-cartilage-aging-osteoarthritis-therapy-research"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; orthopaedic scientist Nidhi Bhutani. "It's clear that a large pool of already existing cells in cartilage are changing their gene expression patterns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And by targeting these cells for regeneration, we may have an opportunity to have a bigger overall impact clinically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's still plenty of work to do, this could eventually lead to effective treatments to roll back the damage done by arthritis or aging in general. We could be heading towards a future where hip and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-s-now-an-artificial-cartilage-gel-that-s-strong-enough-to-work-on-knees"&gt;knee replacements&lt;/a&gt; are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides replacing the joints affected, current treatment options for osteoarthritis are limited to pain management. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radiation-therapy-reduces-pain-from-the-most-common-form-of-arthritis"&gt;promising research&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, we don't have anything yet that tackles the root cause of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps could include a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="187978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igaf122.3994"&gt;A previous trial&lt;/a&gt; of a 15-PGDH blocker to combat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/protecting-your-muscle-mass-is-vital-for-healthy-aging-heres-why"&gt;muscle weakness&lt;/a&gt; didn't raise any red flags in terms of health and safety, which should speed up the process of trials for similar drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very excited about this potential breakthrough," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/joint-cartilage-aging-osteoarthritis-therapy-research"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Blau. "Imagine regrowing existing cartilage and avoiding joint replacement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adx6649"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk60wi1o006xbem2szmezvfz@published"&gt;This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/05/childhood-vaccine-immunization-schedule-overhaul/"&gt;sweeping changes to the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, removing broad recommendations for immunization against such diseases as flu, hepatitis A, rotavirus, and meningitis. Until recently, the U.S. vaccine schedule called for routine protection against 17 diseases; the changes lower that number to 11 diseases. There’s &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/and-what-have-we-done?utm_source=publication-search"&gt;no new science&lt;/a&gt; that would support such a colossal change, and the American Academy of Pediatricians and public health experts alike continue to recommend the evidence-backed former schedule. The &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/07/cdc-vaccine-recommendations-schedule-revisions/"&gt;unusually unilateral&lt;/a&gt; declaration comes a month after President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-begins-process-to-align-u-s-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/"&gt;issued a memorandum&lt;/a&gt; directing the CDC and the Secretary of Health and Human Services—aka longtime anti-vaccine activist RFK Jr.—to “align U.S. core childhood vaccine recommendations with best practices from peer, developed countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb1001v3b7bwijv9ff6@published"&gt;These “peer, developed countries” mentioned are Denmark, which recommends vaccinations for 10 diseases; Japan, which recommends 14; and Germany, which recommends 15. Fifteen! Fifteen is a lot more than America’s new number, 11, is it not? In the days since the new schedule announcement, vaccine experts have repeatedly pointed out that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/26/nx-s1-5656214/childhood-vaccination-denmark-rfk-policy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denmark&lt;/em&gt; is actually the outlier&lt;/a&gt; from the “peer” countries for having such a parsimonious schedule. And there’s a key difference between us and Denmark: Denmark has free universal health care. If their health care system was a road, it would be smooth, and they’re able to drive the Porsche that is fewer vaccinations, epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina writes in her &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/a-unilateral-change-to-childhood"&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt;. It would be silly—and dangerous—to attempt to drive that same Porsche through the hazardous terrain that is the U.S. health care system. But that is essentially what we’re doing, she says, by adopting a vaccine schedule akin to Denmark’s.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="203" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb1001w3b7b9bbyqz78@published"&gt;Because while Denmark has reliable prenatal care, consistent follow-up, and a national health registry that essentially tracks everyone from birth to death, the U.S. … well, the U.S. has literally none of those things. What we do have are the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/04/u-s-pregnancy-related-deaths-continuing-to-rise/"&gt;highest maternity mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4856058/"&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; among our “peer” countries. What’s more, we’re one of the only countries in the entire world that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/upshot/paid-leave-democrats.html"&gt;does not mandate any paid parental leave&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Tonga, and just a few others. Denmark, on the other hand, offers 24 weeks for the mother and 24 weeks for the father, plus a little more for the mother prior to the birth—nearly a &lt;a href="https://www.norden.org/en/info-norden/parental-benefit-denmark"&gt;year in total&lt;/a&gt;. That means that babies are able to stay home longer with their parents, avoiding exposure to diseases that they’re not yet vaccinated for, and that also present a higher mortality risk to infants than to even slightly older children. Americans don’t have the same opportunity. Most licensed child care centers &lt;a href="https://www.parents.com/daycare-for-infants-when-to-start-8622394#:~:text=Most%20licensed%20child%20care%20centers,the%20daycare%20center's%20policies%2C%20including:"&gt;accept babies as young as 6 weeks old&lt;/a&gt;, a choice that many parents are forced to make because they need to return to work (if they can &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/10/when-child-care-costs-more-than-rent-women-stay-at-home.html"&gt;afford the child care&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/01/theres-not-enough-child-care-in-the-u-s-for-all-the-families-that-need-it.html"&gt;whole other discussion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb1001x3b7bka9fdjyn@published"&gt;Day cares are germy places. “Anytime you have a gathering of kids in close quarters, you risk sharing germs,” says Elizabeth Murray, a pediatrician in Rochester, New York. And young children, who are still developing immunity to common germs and also like to stick their fingers in their mouth and eyes, share a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of germs. Research shows that in their first three years of life, kids in day cares &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-07/kids-who-go-to-childcare-get-sick-more-often-than-others/104053704"&gt;get sick more often&lt;/a&gt; with stomach bugs, ear infections, and upper respiratory infections than kids who are cared for at home (again, an option which, in the States, with our lean parental leave, can be very expensive for parents). The more kids there are in the child care setup, the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10995-012-1125-5"&gt;higher the rate&lt;/a&gt; of illnesses. Take some vaccines away from that equation—more illnesses still.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb2001y3b7bplgieci6@published"&gt;While states &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; still require that kids receive certain vaccines for day care even if they’ve been dropped from the recommended CDC vaccine schedule, it stands to reason that the new recommendations may influence some states to reduce their requirements too. So far, several states including &lt;a href="https://www.news10.com/capitol/cdc-vaccine-schedule-changes/"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thebaynet.com/maryland-rejects-cdcs-new-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-will-use-aap-guidelines-instead/"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://lincolnchronicle.org/oregon-other-states-reject-trump-administrations-latest-vaccine-recommendations-for-kids/"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; have released statements that they’re rejecting the new CDC recommendations for school and day care entry requirements. It’s not yet clear what red states will do, though “we’re likely to see states going in very different directions with their own vaccine recommendations, largely along partisan lines,” says Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of public health at Yale University. A long piece in the Tallahassee Democrat titled “&lt;a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2026/01/06/florida-vaccination-rules-children-cdc-guidelines-reduces-recommended-immunizations/88045990007/"&gt;What Florida parents should know about new CDC vaccination guidelines&lt;/a&gt;” ultimately offers little to go by: “We have reached out to the Florida Department of Health to see what its plans are,” the reporter notes.&lt;/p&gt;

And “the more we encounter confusion around vaccines,” he says, “the more likely it is that more kids will not receive vaccines that they otherwise could or should.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb200203b7bcun3kjm9@published"&gt;What’s certain is that more kids—and families—will suffer in various ways. Even outcomes that fall short of the very &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; outcome can still be horrible. Murray points out rotavirus, which lost its general recommendation status with the new schedule. While it’s not a major cause of death, the virus &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/vaccines/119330"&gt;comes with high costs&lt;/a&gt;: extremely brutal symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting for children, days of hospitalization, and the high medical bills that come with that. Not to mention the missed days of work—you can’t send your kid to child care when they are sick. “Boy, I definitely remember when we would admit a whole lot of children to the hospital with rotavirus,” says Murray. The vaccine, which was developed in 2006, “wiped it out. I haven’t seen rotavirus in well over a decade.” If rotavirus vaccination rates go down, that’s likely to change. Then there could soon be yet another bug to worry about when parents have to send their infants to day care so that they can head back to &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While the drugs slow the disease down, the benefits are minor, and they &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/22/uk-health-regulator-rejects-lecanemab-as-treatment-for-alzheimers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have been rejected&lt;/a&gt; for widespread use by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In searching for alternative therapies, scientists at UCL say drug developers should focus on two risk-raising variants of a gene named Apoe. Therapies designed to block the variants’ impact have “vast potential” for preventing the disease, they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Dylan Williams, a genetic epidemiologist at UCL, said: “Most Alzheimer’s disease cases would not arise without the contribution of just this single gene: Apoe. We need to think about it as a direct target. Almost all potential Alzheimer’s cases could benefit from Apoe-related interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More than half a million people in the UK, and more than 40 million worldwide, are living with Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. Several genes contribute to Alzheimer’s risk and lifestyle is important too: smoking, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol all make the disease more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Williams and his colleagues analysed medical records from more than 450,000 people of European ancestry to calculate how much Alzheimer’s disease arose due to different variants of the Apoe gene. People inherit two copies of the gene – one from each parent – and there are three main variants: Apoe2, 3 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists have long known that people with two copies of Apoe4 are high risk for Alzheimer’s, though 40% to 70% never develop the disease. The Apoe3 variant is widely considered neutral and the rare Apoe2 variant is regarded as protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Williams said we should see it another way. Compared with carrying two copies of Apoe2, both Apoe3 and Apoe4 raise the risk of Alzheimer’s, he said. Writing in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44400-025-00045-9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;npj Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the team calculate that without these variants, 72% to 93% of Alzheimer’s cases, and about 45% of all dementia, would not have occurred. “If interventions could eliminate the detrimental effects [of Apoe3 and 4], we could expect to prevent most Alzheimer’s disease and a large proportion of all dementia,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That is a big if. The Apoe gene is crucial for moving cholesterol and other fats around the body and brain, so knocking it out entirely is likely to cause problems. Future therapies might edit the gene variants, or dampen down their activity, but those are neither imminent nor risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Another problem is that the vast majority of people – more than 99% in the study – carry Apoe3 or Apoe4. So preventing Alzheimer’s would mean treating nearly the entire population, possibly through invasive gene editing of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study received a mixed reception. Tim Frayling, professor of human genetics at the University of Geneva, said claiming more than 90% of Alzheimer’s would not occur without the Apoe gene’s effects was like saying more than 90% of road traffic deaths would not occur without the contribution of cars. “People should not worry if they have the risk versions of the gene, because 99.4% of us do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:11,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&amp;quot;:true}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration at the University of Edinburgh, said understanding the risk factors that made the brain vulnerable to Alzheimer’s was “essential for developing effective treatments and prevention strategies”, adding that Apoe was one of the most important genetic risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Sheona Scales, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Evidence around Apoe3 contributing to Alzheimer’s and dementia risk is significant, as this has been largely thought of as having a neutral effect on risk. However, it’s important to note that not everyone with these Apoe gene variations will go on to develop dementia, as other risk factors also have an influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This research raises lots of interesting questions, such as how Apoe3 and Apoe4 could drive Alzheimer’s risk, their effects in people of non-European ancestry, and whether targeting these variants could be a promising avenue for treatment and prevention of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Because of the complexity of Alzheimer’s risk, Apoe testing is not available on the NHS for people worried about their risk of developing Alzheimer’s in the future. If you are worried about your dementia risk, you should speak to your GP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNMnFnTXlQUlBPVERraFJNS29sM3I2NXY0cUVtZFFoUXprbGZiSU53R0QyRE1JWE5sS1pwMjFUUFVKRDNfQzdLQ0RjRDdUMGFlX09USFNfZHI3b1hycXpaZGtNc0d0Zjd3MkNuOXA0WFJVejhiTUdjSnViNXZHeDdQOUpvekt5SlJIVGpVS0N4VGFaRzdQbUhfaW8yckw5YzZ6Q1U0Y0VVLTZ2a2ZQcnFz</guid></item><item><title>建议卫生专业人员佩戴口罩级口罩-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/09/health-professionals-respirator-grade-masks-who-advise</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Surgical face masks provide inadequate protection against flu-like illnesses including Covid, and should be replaced by respirator-level masks – worn every time doctors and nurses are face to face with a patient, according to a group of experts urging changes to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is “no rational justification remaining for prioritising or using” the surgical masks that are ubiquitous in hospitals and clinics globally, given their “inadequate protection against airborne pathogens”, they said in &lt;a href="https://whn.global/a-call-for-the-universal-use-of-respirators-in-healthcare/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a letter to WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is even less justification for allowing healthcare workers to wear no face covering at all,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the height of the Covid pandemic an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/08/disposable-face-masks-covid-chemical-timebomb" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated 129bn&lt;/a&gt;

organised last year called Unpolitics, looking at the implementation of evidence-based policies. It was authored by seven clinicians and scientists, including Finkel, and has been endorsed by almost 50 senior clinicians and researchers, and more than 2,000 members of the public, including clinically vulnerable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There could be “off-ramps”, where governments or establishments decide respirators are not necessary, based on factors such as community infection rates, and ventilation or air filtration devices in a room, the letter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the suggested guidance would apply only in healthcare settings, where the risk of infection is higher, it is likely to provoke controversy. Face masks &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/08/08/with-face-masks-britain-imported-an-american-culture-war" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;became a culture war issue&lt;/a&gt; during the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In December, Tory leader &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/09/nhs-leader-calls-for-revival-of-mask-wearing-amid-tidal-wave-of-flu" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Kemi Badenoch said&lt;/a&gt; she had been “slightly traumatised by all the mask wearing that we had to do during Covid” in response to comments by an NHS leader saying people with flu symptoms “must wear” a face mask in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO cannot mandate global policies, but the signatories argue that an update to its infection prevention and control guidelines to recommend respirators could have a profound impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They also suggest that the WHO’s procurement infrastructure could help increase access to respirators even in poorer countries, with production of surgical masks phased down over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Surgical masks are still “better than nothing”, Finkel conceded, with studies suggesting they block approximately 40% of Covid-sized particles in the air, compared with 95% for respirators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He says the comparative reduction in risk can be thought of like falling off a wall of four inches rather than four feet: “You can still trip and break an ankle at four inches, but you’re much better off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critics of the group’s arguments point to &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD006207_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a lack of randomised controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; showing that physical measures slow the spread of respiratory viruses. Finkel and the other authors say such trials are simply not possible, for example because people in a trial will not wear masks 24/7 and could be exposed to pathogens while unmasked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead they say physical tests showing that respirators stop particles, conducted in laboratories, offer sufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="eaf47ec1-39ae-46e9-a57b-b83d49c107fe" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;FFP2 face masks being tested at Moldex-Metric, a German protective workwear manufacturer.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure id="6e178cb4-df19-43ff-ac13-09a13bc02403" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"World agrees pandemic accord for tackling outbreaks of disease","elementId":"6e178cb4-df19-43ff-ac13-09a13bc02403","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/20/world-agrees-pandemic-accord-for-tackling-outbreaks-of-disease-who-covid"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO has been criticised for being slow to describe Covid-19 as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/03/australia-prime-ministers-prize-for-science-lidia-morawska-covid-michael-wear-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-knowledge" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;spreading via “airborne” particles&lt;/a&gt; and the letter also calls for it to revisit earlier statements and “unambiguously inform the public that it spreads via airborne respiratory particles”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Trisha Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00124-23" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whose research&lt;/a&gt; is cited extensively in the letter and is one of its signatories, said: “A germ that does not get inside someone cannot make them sick.

Respirators are designed to fit closely around the face and meet high filtration standards. Medical masks, in contrast, fit loosely and leak extensively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The letter’s supporters include members of the &lt;a href="https://whn.global/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;World Health Network&lt;/a&gt;, prominent US epidemiologist Eric Feigl-Ding, and Guardian columnist George Monbiot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A WHO spokesperson said the letter required “careful review”.

&lt;p&gt;But did it really? And has reducing the number of diseases all children are advised to be vaccinated against to 11 from 18 brought the United States in line with most other affluent countries?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two words. No and no. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A STAT analysis of vaccine recommendations in the United States and 37 other countries suggests that while the former U.S. schedule did aim to avert more diseases than the schedules of many other countries, it did so by only a few more diseases than in multiple other nations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australasia. (The analysis drew the information from &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global?topic=Vaccination-schedule&amp;amp;location=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a World Health Organization database&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on information the WHO receives from its member countries; in the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ntpc.gov.tw/en/basic/?mode=detail&amp;amp;node=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;case of Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, information was drawn from its department of health website.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Korea, an economic powerhouse, recommends all children be vaccinated against 18 diseases, as does Brazil. Greece recommends vaccines against 17 diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(For the purposes of this analysis, STAT has counted antibody products that protect against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, towards a country’s vaccine total, if it recommends the shot for all babies.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;In fact, the pared-down U.S. vaccine schedule now aims to protect children against fewer diseases than all but one of the 20 so-called peer countries whose schedules were &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/assessment-of-the-us-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-compared-to-other-countries.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;presented by federal health officials as the rationale&lt;/a&gt; for the policy change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sole country is Denmark, an international outlier that currently recommends vaccines to protect against only 10 diseases for all children. But the country is in the process of assessing whether to add the chickenpox vaccine to its schedule, with the Danish Health Authority’s panel of vaccine advisers voting in December to green light a medical technology evaluation of the vaccine, the next step in a multi-step evaluation process, according to Jens Lundgren, an infectious diseases professor at the University of Copenhagen, who is on the committee. Lundgren said a final decision will likely come in the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The revised U.S. schedule also recommends vaccines against fewer diseases than a range of other countries including Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Brazil, China, Taiwan, and even the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau, whose childhood vaccination schedule includes vaccines to protect against 12 childhood diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The decision to carve certain vaccines out of the childhood schedule &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/05/childhood-vaccine-schedule-new-cdc-recommendation-11-shots/"&gt;was announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. is a global outlier among peer nations in the number of target diseases included in its childhood vaccination schedule and in the total number of recommended vaccine doses,” said the analysis used to explain the decision, written by Tracy Beth Høeg of the Food and Drug Administration and Martin Kulldorff of the Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Høeg, a sports medicine doctor who studied for a time in Denmark and is a dual American-Danish citizen, is the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/11/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-cder-director-faces-staff-mistrust/"&gt;acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research&lt;/a&gt;. Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist, was recently named chief science and data officer for the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at HHS. Both are political appointees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccine experts disagree with their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They want you to believe that we’re way out of sync, and that we give way more vaccines than everybody else. But we don’t,” said Anna Durbin, director of the Center for Immunization Research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 38 vaccine schedules that STAT analyzed recommended shots against an average of 14 diseases for all children. The only country that recommended vaccines against as few diseases as Denmark was Vietnam, which is in the process of adding &lt;a href="https://en.baochinhphu.vn/heath-ministry-to-add-four-more-vaccines-to-expanded-immunization-program-111240610170245145.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vaccines to protect against four diseases to its childhood schedule&lt;/a&gt; — including flu, rotavirus, human papillomavirus, and pneumococcal disease — by the end of the decade. Even among the 20 countries listed as peers in the Høeg-Kulldorff report, the average number of preventable diseases vaccinated against was 13.6.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But deciding on which vaccines to recommend for all children — which diseases and their consequences a country wants to help its children avoid — is not typically done by simply selecting a number, said William Moss, a professor of epidemiology at Hopkins and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just in terms of process, one could legitimately ask: Is the best way to determine the U.S. immunization schedule just by comparing it to other countries and kind of cherry-picking which country you want to follow per particular vaccine antigen?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Creating an immunization schedule is a complex process and there are multiple factors that play into it, including estimates of disease burden and the particular health care system,” Moss noted. “But I think it’s very important for the American public to understand that if a particular country like Denmark doesn’t include a vaccine, it’s not because they think that vaccine is harmful. It has to do with their own calculus, in their own country, their own situation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anders Hviid, who heads the department of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark’s public health agency, concurred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You cannot adopt the public health policies of another country unless the population, health care system and prevalence of infectious diseases match,” he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As many experts have pointed out, the differences between the demographics and disease-burden dynamics of the United States (population: 343 million) and Denmark (population: &lt;a href="https://www.dst.dk/en/Statistik/emner/borgere/befolkning/befolkningstal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;6 million&lt;/a&gt;) are profound — to say nothing of the fact that the latter has an effective universal health care system. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly adopted U.S. schedule focuses on 11 diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (also known as Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella or chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diseases that were targeted by the vaccines Høeg and Kulldorff recommended shaving off the schedule are: rotavirus, RSV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, influenza, meningococcal disease, and Covid-19. The Trump administration, under health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had already moved to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/05/cdc-hepatitis-b-vaccination-acip-panel-overturns-30-year-policy/"&gt;eliminate the universal recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/19/what-acip-meeting-says-about-vaccine-schedule-rfk-restoring-trust-vaccines/"&gt;the one recommending Covid shots&lt;/a&gt; for all children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the new plan, the vaccines removed from the universally recommended schedule will be offered to children who are at risk of contracting the illness the vaccine protects against (RSV, hepatitis A and B, and meningococcal disease) if a way to figure out who is at risk can be determined. And all vaccines removed from the core schedule will still be available if parents want them for their children after having discussed the decision with their medical team. That’s a process called shared decision-making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparing the vaccine schedules of different countries is challenging for a number of reasons. The populations of some countries are exposed to some diseases that are not common elsewhere. The Japanese encephalitis vaccine is recommended for all children in some East Asian countries — Japan and South Korea among them. Brazil recommends vaccination against yellow fever, which is not a threat in North America or Europe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some countries recommend HPV vaccines for girls only; some recommend both girls and boys should be vaccinated. Some recommend flu vaccine for all children, while others target certain age groups, such as schoolchildren, for their flu recommendations. If a country recommended HPV vaccine for all girls, STAT counted that as a universal recommendation, and if it recommended flu vaccine for all children in an age band, that also was counted as a universal recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RSV antibodies complicate assessing differences between countries. The two approved products given to babies to protect them during their first winter are used like a vaccine. They are administered via an injection. But they are not technically vaccines; they are inoculations of antibodies that arm an infant’s immune system to fend off a virus it hasn’t yet had a chance to generate its own protection against. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the RSV monoclonals were recommended for all children by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine use. The ACIP has treated the shots like a vaccine, including coverage of them in the Vaccines for Children program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Høeg and Kulldorff’s comparison of the U.S. schedule with those of peer nations, they do not list RSV monoclonals in their vaccine tallies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RSV monoclonals are new, and a number of countries are still in the process of deciding whether to offer them to all their children, and how to use them in conjunction with an RSV vaccine for pregnant people that arrived on the market at about the same time the first monoclonal was approved. Antibodies generated by the vaccine pass to a fetus in the womb, giving it protection during its first few months of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lundgren, from Denmark’s Vaccination Council, noted, for instance, that that country opted to vaccinate pregnant people against RSV rather than recommend the antibody shots for all babies because studies showed mothers preferred that option and the country’s strong electronic records system made it possible to determine who had been vaccinated. Babies born pre-term, whose mothers haven’t yet been vaccinated, are given monoclonals, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kate O’Brien, director of immunization, vaccination, and biologics for the WHO, said national immunization technical advisory groups juggle a range of factors when making decisions about which vaccines to recommend for all children. Cost-effectiveness. The scale of the risk. The feasibility of figuring out whether a targeted program would get the job done or a universal recommendation is needed. (The U.S. adopted the recently jettisoned policy of recommending every child get hepatitis B vaccine at birth because targeting vaccination at children known to be at risk &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/newborn-hep-b-vaccine-debate-how-it-started/"&gt;was missing too many babies&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s nearly impossible to predict, on an individual basis, who is the child who’s going to have whatever outcome of whatever disease. So each [immunization advisory group] has to balance these decisions,” O’Brien said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She noted that internationally, there isn’t that much variability in the vaccines countries recommend for all their children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is true, though, that the United States under Kennedy takes a different approach to vaccination than it has for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It used to be very clear, from the direction of the program, that the U.S. saw itself as a program that was making an effort to optimize impact,” O’Brien said. “In other words, to prevent the most illness, to prevent the most serious outcomes, to prevent the most health harms by vaccinating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That has resulted in a situation where diseases that were once ubiquitous, which sickened and sometimes killed babies, became for a while much rarer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The challenge now is that individual practitioners and individual parents have the beauty, the benefit that they grew up — and their children are growing up — in a society where these diseases are rare,” she said. “And the reason that they’re rare is because these vaccines have been used. When we stop using the vaccines, these diseases are coming back. There’s no ambiguity about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this study important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;NPR noted that cancer rates are also increasing worldwide. While smoking may be the main culprit in Lebanon, we are now confronting a number of pollutants and chemicals that are increasing our risks for different types of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, air pollution, which Mokdad noted is prevalent in Beirut, has been linked to a number of health problems, including respiratory issues and cancer. In fact, one new study found that women who live in more polluted areas suffer increased risks for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Airborne microplastics — which can be inhaled — also put people at risk for lung cancer, per another recent paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about cancer-causing pollutants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's tough to prevent exposure to all cancer-causing pollutants, but one positive step is to quit smoking if you currently do.

md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A case of Japanese encephalitis virus has been identified north-west of Melbourne. The virus was found in a mosquito trap installed in the western community of Horsham by monitoring personnel. This is the first case of the Australian summer, following an original outbreak of the virus in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Japanese encephalitis virus is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fever, vomiting, and seizures. Once in roughly every 250 cases, the virus causes severe inflammation of the brain, which can be fatal. Luckily, most people who contract it experience either mild symptoms or no symptoms whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Australian researchers have previously identified pig farms as major vectors for the Japanese encephalitis virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is the Japanese encephalitis virus important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thanks to increased global heat and precipitation due to atmospheric pollution, mosquito populations have been spiking. Along with them have been the viruses they carry. This includes Zika, dengue, and West Nile virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about the Japanese encephalitis virus?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers have been busy trying to find new ways to manage explosions of mosquito populations. Some have found that soap can immobilize them without resorting to indiscriminate insecticides.

For comparison, heavy smoking raises the risk of getting lung cancer by more than 15 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium sorbate, which is commonly used to stop mold and bacteria from growing in food and drink, was associated with twice the risk of developing diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers not involved in the studies praised its robust methodology but warned it was premature for consumers to change their behavior until more research is conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultra-vs-minimally-processed-food-simple-tips-to-make-better-choices"&gt;Ultra vs. Minimally Processed Food: Simple Tips to Make Better Choices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Sanders, a nutrition expert at King's College London, cautioned that the results could be "due to an inability to completely correct for other factors already known to contribute to risk".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, processed meat and alcohol are both already strongly linked to higher cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could mean that it was not sodium metabisulfite – which is used in winemaking to kill yeast – that was causing cancer, but actually drinking the wine, Sanders suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one option could be to label foods "that use nitrates/nitrites with a health warning", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies were published days after the UK banned daytime TV, radio, and online advertisements for unhealthy food and drinks that are high in fat, salt, and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today, we’re asking you to do a few things that might feel a bit out of left field — like getting your blood pressure checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-19s2qxj"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;No, it isn’t as fun as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/07/well/brain-health-games-teasers.html"&gt;playing Pips&lt;/a&gt;, but experts say it’s one of the most important things you can do for your brain. That’s because heart health and brain health are intrinsically linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/29/well/live/high-blood-pressure-lower.html"&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, can damage brain cells, and it’s a significant risk factor for stroke and dementia. When blood pressure is too high, it places stress on the walls of arteries in the brain. Over time, that added stress can cause the blood vessel walls to thicken, obstructing blood flow. In other cases, the increased pressure causes the artery walls to thin and leak blood into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;These changes to the blood vessels can sometimes cause a large stroke to occur. More commonly, the damage leads to micro-strokes and micro-hemorrhages, which cause fewer immediate problems and often go unnoticed. But if someone has hypertension for years or decades, these injuries can build up, and the person may start to experience cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;High blood pressure “is known as a silent killer for lots of reasons,” said Dr. Shyam Prabhakaran, the chair of neurology at the University of Chicago. “It doesn’t cause you any symptoms until it does.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Because the damage accumulates over many years, experts say that managing blood pressure in midlife matters most for brain health. Hypertension can be addressed with medication or lifestyle changes, as directed by your doctor. But the first thing you need to do is know your numbers. If your blood pressure comes back higher than 120/80, it’s important to take it seriously, Dr. Prabhakaran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;While you’re at it, there are a few other aspects of your physical health that you should check on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Your eyes and ears are two of them. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/well/mind/hearing-vision-dementia-risk.html"&gt;Hearing and vision loss&lt;/a&gt; have both been shown to increase the risk of dementia. Experts think that with less sensory information coming in to stimulate the brain, the regions that process hearing and vision can start to atrophy. What’s more, people with sensory loss often withdraw or are left out of social interactions, further depriving them of cognitive stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Oral health can also affect your brain health. Research has found a connection between regular flossing and reduced odds of &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/regular-dental-flossing-may-lower-risk-of-stroke-from-blood-clots-irregular-heartbeats?preview=df8b&amp;amp;preview_mode=True"&gt;having a stroke&lt;/a&gt;. That may be because good oral health can help to reduce inflammation in the body. The bacteria that cause gum disease have also been tied to an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32280099/"&gt;increased risk of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;And have you gotten your shingles vaccine? There is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11485228/"&gt;mounting evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it’s a powerful weapon for protecting against dementia. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that it lowered people’s odds of developing the condition by as much as 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;To wrap up this challenge, we want you to schedule a few medical appointments that benefit your brain, as well as your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;After five days of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/well/brain-health-mind-diet-recipes.html"&gt;feeding&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/well/brain-health-exercise-workout.html"&gt;exercising&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2026/01/07/well/brain-health-games-teasers.html"&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; your brain, you are well on your way to better cognitive health.

			&lt;p&gt;When people stop taking the new generation of weight-loss drugs, they pile back on the kilos four times faster than they would after ending diet and exercise regimes, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2025-085304"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt; found Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this was mostly because they lost so much weight in the first place, according to the British researchers who conducted the largest and most up-to-date review of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new generation of appetite-suppressing, injectable drugs called GLP-1 agonists has become immensely popular in the last few years, transforming the treatment for obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="188244" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-comes-back-when-you-stop-taking-drugs-like-ozempic-study-finds"&gt;Weight Comes Back When You Stop Taking Drugs Like Ozempic, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have been found to help people lose between 15 and 20 percent of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This all appears to be a good news story," said Susan Jebb, a public health nutrition scientist at Oxford University and co-author of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2025-085304"&gt;a new &lt;em&gt;BMJ&lt;/em&gt; study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, recent data have suggested that "around half of people discontinue these medications within a year," she told a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be because of common side effects such as nausea or the price – these drugs can cost over $1,000 a month in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188249" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/semaglutide_pen_box_642.jpg" alt="semaglutide pen out of a box" class="wp-image-188249 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/semaglutide_pen_box_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/semaglutide_pen_box_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188249" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;GLP-1 agonist drugs can cost more than $1000 a month in the US.

However, it took an average of four years for them to regain their lost kilos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meant that people taking the drugs regained their weight four times faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/man_resting_after_exercise_642.jpg" alt="man resting after exercise" class="wp-image-188247 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/man_resting_after_exercise_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/man_resting_after_exercise_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It takes an average of four years for weight to return after quitting exercise.

It's also that, well, doctors and scientists aren't psychics, and this mutation of the influenza virus isn't what experts predicted we'd be dealing with this flu season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"This strain could cause a more severe flu season because of its divergence from forecasted viruses used in this season’s flu vaccine," Dr. Evans explains. "Flu viruses can change over time, which can make it harder for our bodies and vaccines to protect us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Photo by CDC&amp;amp;sol;SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY on Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How bad our flu season gets depends on things like which flu viruses we’ve had infections with before, which vaccines we’ve gotten in the past, which flu viruses are spreading this year and how well the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/how-effective-flu-shot-this-year-2024-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu shot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu shot&lt;/a&gt; works against these viruses," he adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Board-certified internist &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.shoshanaungerleider.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Shoshana Ungerleider, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, notes, "The virus has changed enough that our &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/immune-system-trick-we-wish-we-knew-about-sooner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immune systems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immune systems&lt;/a&gt; do not recognize it as well, leading to higher rates of hospitalization, especially among older adults and young children."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1255833/stephanieosmanski/how-many-people-die-from-flu-each-year/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Many People Die of the Flu Each Year?

When these changes accumulate over time, new subclades are create,d and these subclades attack differently than earlier strains," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://publichealth.nmsu.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/faculty/jagdish-khubchandani.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jagdish Khubchandani, Ph.D., MPH, MBBS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jagdish Khubchandani, Ph.D., MPH, MBBS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, professor of public health at New Mexico State University, tells &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;. "Since widespread immunity for such new strains is not generated in one season, we see rampant infections and complications. That's the strength of flu viruses: We chase them, but never get ahead. Over time, they learn to evade our immune systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/about/bio/karla-robinson?srsltid=AfmBOoqpCBBkuoEw7_zEQrYBEqDcKE8CSMYx6dMjy6ecUvAAL1EuR2fe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Karla Robinson, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Karla Robinson, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, licensed, board-certified &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1045384/marynliles/family-quotes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:family;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; physician and medical editor at GoodRx, explains that we're already seeing a lot of signs of widespread infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Research from GoodRx shows Tamiflu fill rates rising earlier and more sharply than in many recent seasons, a sign that more people are seeking treatment," she says. "That means more people are getting sick, and symptoms tend to be more intense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of why the super flu is spreading is just the nature of the virus, but we also need to stay responsible and vigilant as a society. "People need to be at their best in terms of hygiene and sanitation practices, which has been an issue since the COVID pandemic," Dr. Khubchandani says. "Over time, people have been lax in preventive behaviors including &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/surprising-covid-vaccine-side-effect-according-to-study-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vaccination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;.

This means that the flu season has started with a vengeance and people are getting pretty sick."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the H3N2 super flu also brings complications with it for some patients, and it's those complications that make it particularly dangerous, especially for high-risk people and those with compromised immune systems or other pre-existing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is an H3N2 strain, which typically causes more severe disease and is more commonly associated with secondary bacterial pneumonias," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.creighton.edu/campus-directory/tierney-maureen" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Maureen Tierney, MD, MSc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Maureen Tierney, MD, MSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Associate Dean, Department Chair of Clinical Research and Public Health at Creighton University, tells &lt;em&gt;Parade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rwjbh.org/doctors/christopher-f-freer-do-facep-facep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Christopher Freer, DO, FACEP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Christopher Freer, DO, FACEP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, Senior Vice President of Emergency and Hospitalist Medicine at RWJBarnabas Health, explains further why it hits so hard: "This flu strain, subclade K, appears more aggressive because it triggers a stronger inflammatory response in the body. This can lead to higher fevers, more intense fatigue, and a greater risk of complications like pneumonia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habit-to-break-to-avoid-getting-sick-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The One Habit Doctors Are Begging You To Break ASAP if You Don't Want To Get Sick This Fall;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The One Habit Doctors Are Begging You To Break ASAP if You Don't Want To Get Sick This Fall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Are Super Flu Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get the flu, take it seriously! Influenza is a respiratory infection. Influenza “packs a punch." It's not "just a cold"—you really are sick. "The impact of the virus on the body is severe; it causes direct damage to the respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs, compromising the body’s natural defense barriers," Dr. Kohut emphasizes. "Even in healthy individuals, the impact of the virus on the body's immune system can create changes that leave the individual susceptible to other infections—particularly bacterial infections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/flu-symptoms-2025-2026" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC), include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of super flu symptoms, you can expect more severe manifestations of the above, plus some other signs that will make you feel lousy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond typical flu symptoms like fever, cough and body aches, warning signs include &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/heart-condition-with-limited-warning-signs-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:trouble breathing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;trouble breathing&lt;/a&gt;, chest pain, confusion, severe weakness, persistent &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/norovirus-symptoms-january-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vomiting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vomiting&lt;/a&gt; or symptoms that worsen instead of improve," Dr. Ungerleider says. "In serious cases, the flu can lead to pneumonia, heart complications, neurologic symptoms, or organ failure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to note about super flu symptoms, Dr. Tierney says, is how they start: "Symptom onset with the flu is often abrupt." This means that you're less likely to have a cough or sore throat that gets progressively worse and instead will be hit hard with symptoms suddenly, even if you felt fine the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Patients should be alert for persistent high fevers, trouble breathing, chest tightness or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/sneaky-reasons-you-feel-exhausted-all-the-time" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:extreme exhaustion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;extreme exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;," Dr. Freer advises. "Severe body aches, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/hydration-hack-that-can-dehydrate-you-according-to-dietitian" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dehydration;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt; and confusion, particularly in older adults, are also concerning signs. If symptoms feel severe or suddenly worsen, it is important to seek medical care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Flu can sometimes lead to serious complications like pneumonia, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/common-cold-remedy-mistake-to-avoid-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sinus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sinus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-people-forget-to-wash-this-body-part" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ear infections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ear infections&lt;/a&gt;, and—in rare cases—&lt;a href="https://parade.com/tag/inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; of the heart or brain, organ failure or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/celebrities/madonna-makes-personal-admission-on-her-near-death-experience" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sepsis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; (a dangerous body-wide reaction to infection)," Dr. Robinson warns.

"The flu vaccine provides the opportunity to prevent infection and spread from certain strains of the flu and it can also decrease the severity of infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does the flu shot offer at least some protection against severe super flu infection, but it comes with a potential bonus for your &lt;a href="https://parade.com/tag/dementia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt; too: A study found that &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/flu-shot-alzheimers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:patients who got their flu shots regularly were 40% less likely;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;patients who got their flu shots regularly were 40% less likely&lt;/a&gt; to be diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://parade.com/tag/alzheimers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/when-to-see-doctor-vaccine-side-effects-according-to-infectious-disease-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:These Are the Actual Vaccine Side Effects You Should Worry About, According to Infectious Disease Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;These Are the Actual Vaccine Side Effects You Should Worry About, According to Infectious Disease Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Are Other Ways To Protect Yourself From Super Flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some common-sense measures can serve as kryptonite for the super flu. "Flu prevention is about staying vigilant and acting early to minimize the severity of your symptoms," &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/doctors-day-2022/sanjiv-shah/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sanjiv Shah, MD, MPH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Sanjiv Shah, MD, MPH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting the flu shot is the most important step," Dr. Ungerleider emphasizes. "Other effective measures include washing hands regularly, covering coughs, staying home when sick, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and using preventive antiviral medication in high risk individuals after known exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also recommend taking it easy. (It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hibernation season, after all.) "We recommend, when possible, to rest, ensure hydration and practice good hand hygiene," Dr. Glazier stresses. "Now is not the time to overdo it and stretch oneself over multiple activities and obligations. Also, if you do not feel well, please be sure to avoid exposing high-risk family and friends (particularly infants and the elderly). When in doubt, it's ok to sit it out and defer the large family gatherings if you are sick."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Freer recommends avoiding touching or rubbing your face and maintaining a healthy diet as ways to help fight off infection, while Dr. Tierney suggests more precautions as well, especially if you're at a high risk for super flu complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consider wearing a mask when in crowded indoor places, especially in healthcare settings," she says, adding that you may want to talk to your doctor about preventative antivirals if you know you've been exposed to flu or super flu but haven't yet shown symptoms.

Don't panic, because you have options!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, see if you can snag a prescription for antivirals from your doctor if you're a good candidate for them. "Treatment and/or prophylaxis are especially important to reduce severity, hospitalization and death among high-risk individuals: the elderly or the very young, those who are immunocompromised and those with chronic medical conditions," Dr. Tierney says. "Oseltamivir, or Tamiflu, has been used for years to treat influenza. It is approved for those two weeks of age and older and can be taken twice a day for five days, or if used prophylactically, once a day for 10 days. Both courses of therapy are best to begin within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms or the known exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another medication approved to treat or as prophylaxis against the flu called baloxavir, or Xofluza, which is given as a one-time dose for those over five years of age, Dr. Tierney notes. "It is more expensive and usually well tolerated, but there are fewer years of experience with its use."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-doctors-buy-ahead-of-cold-and-flu-season" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:4 Doctors Share the #1 Thing They Always Buy at CVS at the Start of Cold, Flu and COVID Season;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;4 Doctors Share the #1 Thing They Always Buy at CVS at the Start of Cold, Flu and COVID Season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Evans agrees that the H3N2 super flu is responsive to antiviral treatments, so if you think you're infected, talk to your doctor right away to make sure you can access treatments that can get you feeling better fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, an important but often overlooked note: "Pregnant women are prone to more severe influenza," Dr. Tierney warns. "Therefore, they should consult their obstetrician if ill or exposed to the flu."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of treating your aches, pains and fever, Dr. Freer says, "Rest, fluids and fever-reducing medications like &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/common-cold-remedy-that-sends-people-to-hospital-according-to-er-doctor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acetaminophen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/combining-this-medication-with-coffee-can-boost-its-effects" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ibuprofen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; are key to symptom relief."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robinson also recommends saline rinses if you have nasal congestion, while Dr. Shah says, "Try to eat small, light meals throughout the day to keep up your strength."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/701835/lisamulcahy/10-ways-to-prevent-the-flu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Here Are the 10 Best Ways To Prevent the Flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Here Are the 10 Best Ways To Prevent the Flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Long Does the Super Flu Last?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news about super flu? For most otherwise healthy people, you may not feel &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; crummy for terribly long. "Most otherwise healthy people recover within about a week, though fatigue and cough can last longer," Dr. Ungerleider says. "Recovery can take several weeks for older adults, people with chronic conditions, or anyone who develops complications or requires hospitalization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, make sure to pay attention to long-lasting symptoms. "If symptoms last longer than seven to 10 days, symptoms worsen after about a week or if difficulty breathing occurs, consult your healthcare provider," Dr. Tierney notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if your lingering symptoms don't seem serious to you, you should still get checked out just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lingering fatigue and cough are common, especially in older adults. If you aren't getting better in a week, you should see your doctor," Dr. Freer says. "Sometimes you can have complications from the flu, so if you are still symptomatic after a week, I would recommend you get checked by a health professional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1146372/marijkevroomendurning/flu-symptoms-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Do You Have the Flu?

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUFFALO, N.Y. — Erie County health officials are urging people to use hospital emergency rooms and ambulances only for true medical emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say a surge in severe respiratory illnesses like the flu are causing mayor slow downs in the ER, with longer waiting room times as well as delays in ambulance response.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to officials at Kenmore Mercy Hospital, they are now having capacity issues with the influx of patients.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 On Your Side talked with Dr. Michael Mangione, the hospital's emergency department medical director, about those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Usually we like to have you try some supportive care at home ... get you to start feeling better," Dr. Mangione said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county health department says the use of 911 should be reserved for life-threatening symptoms such as chest pain, trouble breathing, stroke signs, or severe injuries. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
