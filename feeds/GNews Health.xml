The treatment uses antisense technology to silence the FUS gene, reducing toxic protein buildup in motor neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two patients in a recent case series showed remarkable responses—one regained the ability to walk and breathe unassisted, while another has remained symptom-free for three years. The therapy also significantly reduced neurofilament light levels, a biomarker of nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Therapy:&lt;/strong&gt; The treatment uses antisense oligonucleotides to silence the FUS gene and reduce toxic proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; Some patients showed functional improvement, a rare outcome in ALS research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker Drop:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated patients had up to an 83% reduction in neurofilament light, indicating reduced nerve damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Columbia University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Columbia neurologist and scientist Neil Shneider speaks to his ALS patients who volunteer for experimental therapies, he’s unwaveringly honest. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients always ask me, “What can I hope to get out of this?” Shneider says. “And I always say, in most clinical trials, our hope is that we can slow the disease or maybe even halt progression.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it was a big surprise when some of the patients treated with an experimental drug—a therapy that emerged from Shneider’s research efforts—showed improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110378"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person walking and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ALS-genetics-neuropharmacology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results suggested that reducing levels of toxic FUS proteins could prevent or delay onset and progression of ALS. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When testing new drugs for ALS, we do not expect to see clinical improvement,” Shneider says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve seen in one patient is really unprecedented functional recovery. It’s surprising and deeply motivating for us, the ALS research community, but also the community of ALS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remarkable success stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from 12 patients—all treated with the novel therapy for a rare form of ALS caused by a genetic mutation in a gene called &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;—were presented in a case series published by Shneider online in &lt;em&gt;the Lancet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though these gene mutations are responsible for only 1% to 2% of ALS cases, they cause some of the most aggressive forms of ALS that begin in adolescents and young adults. In patients with these mutations, toxic FUS proteins accumulate in the motor neurons that control the patient’s muscles, eventually killing the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the patients in the published case series showed a remarkable response to the experimental therapy, ulefnersen (previously known as jacifusen), developed by Shneider in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One young woman, who has received injections of the therapy since late 2020, recovered the ability to walk unaided and to breathe without the use of a ventilator, both previously lost to ALS. She has lived longer with this disease than any other known patient with this juvenile-onset form of FUS ALS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second patient, a man in his mid-30s, was asymptomatic when he began treatment, but tests of electrical activity in his muscles indicated that symptoms would likely emerge soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In three years of continuous treatment with the experimental drug, the man has yet to develop any symptoms of FUS-ALS and the abnormal electrical activity in his muscles has improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, after six months of treatment, patients in the series experienced up to 83% decrease in a protein called neurofilament light, a biomarker of nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These responses show that if we intervene early enough and go after the right target at the right time in the course of disease, it’s possible to not only slow disease progression, but actually reverse some of the functional losses,” Shneider says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also a wonderful example of precision medicine and therapeutic development based on science and an understanding of the biology of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most of the other symptomatic patients in the series did not survive their aggressive disease, Shneider says “several apparently benefited from the treatment. The progression of their disease slowed, and they lived a longer life as a consequence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case series also showed that the drug is safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing results from the first of these patients, Ionis Pharmaceuticals committed to sponsoring a global clinical trial of the drug, led by Shneider, which is now in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Now we are eagerly awaiting those results, which we hope will lead to the approval of ulefnersen,” Shneider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The story behind ulefnersen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of ulefnersen began as an effort to help a single patient and has grown into a full-scale clinical trial that could help many patients with this aggressive form of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shneider first tested the therapy six years ago in a patient from Iowa, Jaci Hermstad, whose identical twin had died from the disease years earlier. Shneider worked with Ionis Pharmaceuticals to develop a drug, never tested in people, that might slow the progression of Jaci’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had good reason to believe the drug might work. Just a few years earlier, his research in mice revealed that the FUS mutations cause cells to make proteins that are toxic to motor neurons. The results suggested that reducing levels of toxic FUS proteins could prevent or delay onset and progression of ALS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shneider believed the drug might be a powerful way to reduce FUS proteins. The drug belongs to an emerging and highly promising class that uses short pieces of DNA, called antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, to silence specific genes and halt the production of the proteins they encode. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ulefnersen was designed to silence the FUS gene and reduce production of toxic and normal FUS proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we also found that mature neurons tolerate a reduction of normal FUS protein, our studies provided the rationale for treating FUS-ALS patients with this drug,” Shneider says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Shneider requested permission from the FDA to administer ulefnersen to Jaci through its expanded access program, sometimes called “compassionate use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, at least 25 patients have been treated with ulefnersen (originally named jacifusen for Jaci Hermstad) around the world in expanded access programs, including the dozen patients described in the Lancet article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, ‘Antisense oligonucleotide jacifusen for &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;-ALS: an investigator-initiated, multicentre, open-label case series,” was published online in the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; on May 22, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All authors (from Columbia University except where noted): Neil A Shneider, Matthew B Harms, Vlad A Korobeynikov, Olivia M Rifai, Benjamin N Hoover, Elizabeth A Harrington, Sonia Aziz-Zaman, Jessica Singleton, Arish Jamil, Vikram R Madan, Ikjae Lee, Jinsy A Andrews, Richard M Smiley, Mahabub M Alam, Lauren E Black (Charles River Laboratories), Minwook Shin (Sookmyung Women’s University, Korea), Jonathan K Watts (University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School), David Walk (University of Minnesota Medical School), Daniel Newman (Henry Ford Hospital), Robert M Pascuzzi (Indiana University School of Medicine), Markus Weber (Kantonsspital St. Gallen, , Switzerland), Christopher Neuwirth (Kantonsspital), Sandrine Da Cruz (Leuven Brain InstituteBelgium), Armand Soriano (Ionis Pharmaceuticals), Roger Lane (Ionis), Scott Henry (Ionis), Joel Matthews (Ionis), Paymaan Jafar-Nejad (Ionis), Dan Norris (Ionis), Frank Rigo (Ionis), Robert H Brown (Ionis), Stephan Miller (Ionis), Rebecca Crean (Ionis), and C Frank Bennett (Ionis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by grants from the ALS Association (ALSA CU20-1073), Project ALS, and Ionis Pharmaceuticals and with support from the Tow Foundation and the Nancy D Perlman and Thomas D Klingenstein Innovation Fund for Neurodegenerative Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The study was also funded in part by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01NS106236, TL1TR001875, R01NS111990, UL1TR001873), the American Academy of Neurology, the American Brain Foundation, and the CReATe Consortium, the Angel Fund for ALS Research, Cellucci Fund for ALS Research, Max Rosenfeld ALS Fund, the University of Minnesota, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neil Shneider has received research funding from Ionis Pharmaceuticals in support of this investigator-initiated study.

Jacifusen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt; pre-mRNA, previously shown to delay neurodegeneration in a mouse model and potentially slow functional decline in a first-in-human study. Here, we sought to further evaluate use of jacifusen as a treatment for &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;-ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This expanded access programme was conducted through a series of single-patient investigational new drug applications at five sites (four hospitals in the USA and one in Switzerland). Participants carried a &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt; variant and had clinical evidence of motor neuron disease onset or electrophysiological abnormalities, if not a diagnosis of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were ineligible if chronically ventilated with tracheostomy. Enrolled sequentially, participants received serial intrathecal injections of jacifusen over 2·8–33·9 months. Based on multiple ascending doses of jacifusen (from 20 mg to 120 mg), successive protocols were modified as safety and other data were acquired, with the last participants enrolled receiving 120 mg doses monthly from the start of their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 and standard cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metrics. Concentration of neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF was used as a biomarker of axonal injury and neurodegeneration, and the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score was used as an overall measure of motor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biochemical analysis and immunohistochemical staining were done on post-mortem CNS tissues to quantify FUS protein expression and assess the burden of FUS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between June 11, 2019, and June 2, 2023, we recruited 12 participants (median age 26 years [range 16–45]; seven [58%] were female and five [42%] were male) into the expanded access programme. Transient elevations in cell counts or total protein concentration in CSF (six [50%] participants) were unrelated to treatment duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common adverse events were back pain (six [50%]), headache (four [33%]), nausea (three [25%]), and post-lumbar puncture headache (three [25%]). Two participant deaths were recorded during the programme, both thought to be unrelated to the investigational drug. The concentration of NfL in CSF was reduced by up to 82·8% after 6 months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most participants had continued functional decline (as measured by ALSFRS-R) after starting treatment with jacifusen, one showed unprecedented, objective functional recovery after 10 months, and another remained asymptomatic, with documented improvement in electromyographic abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis of CNS tissue samples from four participants showed reduced FUS protein levels and an apparent decrease in the burden of FUS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest the safety and possible efficacy of jacifusen for treating &lt;em&gt;FUS&lt;/em&gt;-ALS. The efficacy of jacifusen is being further evaluated in an ongoing clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALS Association, Project ALS, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Tow Foundation, Nancy D Perlman and Thomas D Klingenstein Innovation Fund for Neurodegenerative Disease, National Institutes of Health, Angel Fund for ALS Research, Cellucci Fund for ALS Research, Max Rosenfeld ALS Fund, University of Minnesota, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 12:49:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFA5bjFJVjJOeGJMRGd6a21oWjBRbVROMXlDMDhfcG5kWFRiYmNoeU5xVjBFZk41cnp0ZkEzUGZ4amFTaG5iS0tWZ2hhdWRQMUlpWmFhVUJST04wRktZbTZySFpsMjdNbUI0TmdQeXN3</guid></item><item><title>多产精子捐赠者通过遗传癌症导致10个后代发生突变- Ynetnews | Prolific sperm donor passes genetic cancer causing mutation to 10 offsprings - Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE91akozR1oxT3ZDSWh3TldXUW8wZGRidWxWUVFSZWVTbERIZ2ZHRHRVazU2enE4X3Zpb3h3QV94SmdGR0JHaXJxUVE4NHlzcEhLSk1QS1R6SHFycmhvRVRGMG1hS3I4c1g1aHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Prolific sperm donor passes genetic cancer causing mutation to 10 offsprings&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;Donor fathering 67 babies, carrying an undetected TP53 mutation; 23 of his offspring inherited cancer risk and 10 are diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma; Israeli legislation to prevent such cases, lacking  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 10:57:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE91akozR1oxT3ZDSWh3TldXUW8wZGRidWxWUVFSZWVTbERIZ2ZHRHRVazU2enE4X3Zpb3h3QV94SmdGR0JHaXJxUVE4NHlzcEhLSk1QS1R6SHFycmhvRVRGMG1hS3I4c1g1aHc</guid></item><item><title>与狼疮一起生活以及疾病的奥秘- TribLIVE.com | Living with lupus and the mystery of the disease - TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPZ3hreGVoNFNOeXNRS296QlkwRzhCU1ZoVElZbEdJM0NqUXhIYW9zYm1vaGo0LW4yd05CVFgtek1ORmNBOHdFYlp0UWR4M1VCU1Q1ZDdJUkl1WkVaUE84ei1OazJUY2JWcW84WFYyUzFodjliSVcxeW9YbTc2NmxtVnFEWFpVYUNEeTgzX2Fn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

it's likely that these are going to increase in range," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's just a general trend that lots of these viruses – knows as flaviviruses – these are viruses that circulate in mosquitoes and they're general around the tropics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But because of global warming they're increasing their range northwards and it does mean there is a risk that we're going to see some of these tropical viral diseases become established further and further north."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He added the best way to avoid the virus was to "avoid being bitten" by covering up and using insecticide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The project in Gamston will see the UK Health Security Agency work with Bassetlaw District Council and Nottinghamshire County Council to increase surveillance &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/newsroom/news/mosquitoes-to-be-studied-in-gamston-this-summer-as-part-of-national-project-to-improve-monitoring" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;on land along the River Idle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 07:20:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFA5N0I5NHc1RXNWSzcwWjE5NTlpeXJBU2llRnhqa1VtcWVtOE9NU2MxMU9nMDI3SUVZeldtNmdDUGFUU2JPc0dEcl9aRl92ZnFXbTdwc0NtcW5fZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE9wTGlHSFItTHZvM3ZlTFBVUEN2V2Y4ZDFKQWRvVm1XY3NqdVo4bDZVOFBoODB6ZkFEUlg2U2RxdHZhQTBBaE9XVVNjTENYWTdKSUJkZTl0cHBHeEtxbkdB</guid></item><item><title>一位专业培训师使用这八个动作来帮助她的父母提高力量和平衡- Fit&amp;Well | An expert trainer uses these eight moves to help her parents improve their strength and balance -

&lt;p&gt;It’s normal for everyday life and tasks to feel more difficult as you get older. Simple things that you probably didn’t have to think about at one point, like getting up off the couch or carrying grocery bags, might now feel like a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t have to be the case—not if you have a strength training programme in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training is an effective way to future-proof your body, and keep your joints and muscles healthy as you age, offsetting the natural effects of getting older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Martin is a personal trainer who recently shared a look at how she trains her parents, who are in their late 50s and 60s, to help them maintain their independence as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These exercises are great for those who are looking to build muscle, improve balance and improve mobility,” Martin tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin designed this workout with everyday life in mind. “These exercises will help you get up off the floor with ease, push things above your head without shoulder pain, get up and down out of your chair, pick things up off the ground without lower-back pain, and feel more stable on your feet day to day,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

Kneel to stand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;2 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 6 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise will help you get off the floor with more ease,” says Martin. It targets the quads, hamstrings, glutes and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-squat-on-balance-ball"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Squat on balance ball&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10-12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can be done on a balance ball or the ground,” says Martin, although she recommends investing in a balance ball if you’re able to. “The balance ball is great because it will help strengthen your core and improve your balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Holding onto a resistance band will allow you to get lower in your squat,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-hamstring-curl"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Hamstring curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 6-8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the best exercises to help alleviate lower-back pain and increase hip flexibility,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-push-press"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Push press&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 10-12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise will allow you to feel more confident pressing things up over your head day to day,” says Martin. “A push and press is a powerful movement that will also help improve shoulder mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-standing-march"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Standing march&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 20-24 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise helps build core strength and stability, and will also help improve balance and coordination, as well as improve flexibility in the hip flexors,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-6-split-squat-with-twist"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.

Bird dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets: &lt;/strong&gt;1 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 12-16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the best exercises to improve balance and mobility, and alleviate or prevent back pain,” says Martin.&lt;/p&gt;

Digestive issues often disrupt daily life, from uncomfortable bloating to stubborn constipation. Scheduling a doctor’s appointment for small ailments isn’t often possible.In such cases, one turns to home remedies that are effective. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a California-based gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, with a million Instagram followers, has shared some home remedies one can try to eliminate common digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Yogurt for gut health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider yogurt as the bestie of gut health. Packed with probiotics, yogurt introduces beneficial bacteria that balance the gut microbiome. Yogurt aids digestion and boosts immunity. Yogurt is good for overall gut health. Choose plain, unsweetened yogurt with live cultures for maximum benefits. Regular consumption of yogurt can enhance gut flora, reduce inflammation, and improve overall digestive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Kiwi to relieve constipation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those struggling with constipation, Dr. Sethi suggests kiwi. This small, nutrient-dense fruit is rich in fiber and contains actinidin, an enzyme that promotes bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiwi can get things flowing! Eating one or two kiwis daily can help alleviate constipation. Kiwi can increase stool frequency and improve consistency without the side effects of laxatives. Its high vitamin C content also supports overall digestive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people struggle with bloating. But a simple remedy can help relieve the uncomfortable gut issue. Ginger! Bloating can be uncomfortable and disruptive, and Dr. Sethi says ginger is a natural solution. Known for its anti-inflammatory and carminative properties, ginger helps relax the digestive tract and reduce gas buildup. One can consume ginger in a tea, grated into meals, or taken as a supplement. Ginger can soothe the stomach and improve digestion.Incorporating small amounts of ginger in your daily diet is good for your gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Bananas to combat diarrhea and acid reflux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bananas are great for digestive health. Dr. Sethi recommends bananas to stop diarrhea. Bananas have pectin, a soluble fiber that absorbs excess water in the intestines and firms up stools. They’re gentle and easy to digest, making them ideal when the digestive system is upset. Bananas can also help with acid reflux, as they act as a natural antacid, coating the stomach lining and neutralizing acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat gut inflammation, Dr. Sethi recommends turmeric, a spice celebrated for its active compound, curcumin. Turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory that can calm an irritated gut. Curcumin has been shown to reduce symptoms of inflammatory bowel conditions and support gut healing. Consider adding turmeric to meals or taking it as a supplement with black pepper to enhance absorption. Beyond the gut, turmeric is also beneficial for overall immune health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy and effective home remedies for constipation relief&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Papaya to boost digestive enzymes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papaya is like a natural digestive aid. People who require digestive enzyme support, papaya is Dr. Sethi’s top pick. Rich in papain, an enzyme that aids protein digestion, papaya helps break down food and reduce digestive strain. Regular consumption of papaya can ease symptoms of indigestion and improve nutrient absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这5种工作习惯很常见，但它们可能是抑郁症的微妙迹象- BuzzFeed | These 5 Work Habits Are Pretty Common, But They Could Be Subtle Signs Of Depression - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOa3pHNTlNWGZCV1lQUXZfOHVkNHBEa0NsVWdmYjFjVFZsWUhPR3p0aVNmRlcxaUpqd2h6dXF5OGhNZjRnVHhJOGk1b3VVZU9iQ19iVzlxcU0wY2ZiX2h3SkNNa1phV0VHNlBLZVpWNWcwbXV5R2FIR1p4VVIwVnJHbDNJazh4WHJCYWtJWVlTUVJnMDRxMU5xZmpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between a one-time boring assignment and a worrisome pattern of apathy. Notice changes about how you feel regarding work that you used to take satisfaction in doing, Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You might notice yourself just staring at your screen, pretending to be busy, or doing anything but tackling the big stuff,” Garcia said. “That loss of interest that depression can cause may have you thinking ‘I just don’t care’ about your work.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do next if you suspect you have depression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these signs are resonating with your experience at work, know that you do not have to deal with depression on your own. There are steps you can take immediately to address how you are feeling and get better: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to what your body is telling you about your health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your depression shows up as you hyper-functioning at work, it helps to check in with your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be easy to miss depressive symptoms when work is tricking you into feeling competent and self-efficacious,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why Velez suggests asking yourself questions that can help you notice changes in your physical health like: Are you feeling more tired than usual? What’s your relationship with alcohol or marijuana? Are you getting too little or too much sleep? How is your relationship with exercise and movement? Are there points of nagging tension anywhere in your body? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical signs and signals can alert you that it may be time to acknowledge those uncomfortable feelings,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to loved ones and trusted peers about how you’re feeling. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are depressed, you might not want anyone to know and may feel unworthy of your friends’ support. But in fact, talking to a few trusted peers and loved ones can be just what you need to help you against withdrawing and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best way to start managing depression is to talk with someone about it,” Howes said. He said you could open up to a friend or loved one, and let them know what you’re experiencing and how it’s impacting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Velez said it can also help for employees experiencing depression to ask trusted colleagues to stop by their desk for a quick coffee chat a couple times a week or to check in with them via text. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek professional help. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Know that depression is very common and often responds well to treatment,” Howes said. “If it seems like this is depression, talking with a physician or a mental health professional is crucial. They will be able to assess your symptoms and recommend a course of treatment that may include therapy, medication or both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With written documentation of your depression by a medical professional, you may also qualify for reasonable accommodations at your job under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Examples of these accommodations can include permission to work from home or an altered schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-boss-work_l_64a5846ae4b0dcb22c48cb1a" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795"&gt;you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager&lt;/a&gt;, they may be able to help you get company-sponsored resources and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many workplaces offer EAPs [Employee Assistance Programs] which have counselors on staff to provide short-term therapy or can also give the employee referrals for other services that may be needed such as child care, food and housing assistance, and therapists in the community,” Velez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess whether your job is making your depression worse. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing psychiatrist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9667129/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Aaron T. Beck&lt;/a&gt;’s research on cognitive behavioral therapy, Velez said it is also important to learn if your job is providing you with the ability to feel pleasure, or a sense of enjoyment, and mastery, or a sense of achievement, because those are factors people need in order to combat depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To monitor if your job is exacerbating symptoms or is the source of them, Velez said an employee can keep track of work activities for one or two weeks in a spreadsheet, with one column for “pleasure” and another column for “mastery.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having visual evidence can be a great way to confirm or deny our feelings,” Velez said. “Taking an inventory can let you know if you are getting pleasure and mastery from your job or if it’s time to start looking for a new job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that tiny wins do make a difference. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression often pushes you to isolate, do nothing, and be unkind to yourself. Doing the opposite, even in tiny ways, can really help,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Garcia said that if you’re struggling to get out of bed and are showing up late to work, you can try sitting up when you wake instead of staying horizontal. And if projects feel overwhelming, Garcia recommended breaking them down into smaller steps or committing to just five minutes of focused effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it helps to understand that you are more than your depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“See depression as something separate from who you are and practice resisting its urges,” Garcia recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point is to remember that depression can be a tough mental health condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;millions of people every day&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a manageable one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-job-signs_l_65dcc2cde4b005b858310eac" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nami.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helpline is 1-888-950-6264 (NAMI) and provides information and referral services; &lt;a href="http://www.goodtherapy.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879795" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GoodTherapy.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an association of mental health professionals from more than 25 countries who support efforts to reduce harm in therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

See if these work behaviors resonate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You are working harder than ever to avoid going home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Tempura / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Depression can look different from person to person. Some co-workers may never guess that you are coping with depression because you are still functioning as a hardworking, reliable employee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“For successful working professionals who have made a career out of achievement and getting validation from work, depression might look more active,” said &lt;a href="https://www.aliciaveleztherapy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alicia Velez;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alicia Velez&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed clinical social worker based in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She gave the example of an employee going through a divorce or taking care of a sick family member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You might have someone working more hours than usual, maybe raising their hand to go on that long business trip, or wanting to be the one to tackle challenging cases or problems,” Velez said. “Validation and recognition at work tend to feel better than having to confront that a marriage may be over or that a family member may be at the end of his/her life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You were once a social butterfly but now you avoid co-workers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; VioletaStoimenova / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How you interact with co-workers at work can help you understand if you are dealing with just a bad day or something deeper. Withdrawing from colleagues and isolating yourself are two common signs of depression, Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“This may look like someone who used to actively participate in meetings is [now] quieter, sits in the back of the room, or even misses the meeting altogether,” she said. “Perhaps the employee no longer takes part in off-sites or after work happy hours. He or she might find ways to evade interactions with colleagues or managers. The worker may let their calls go to voicemail, or be slow to respond to emails or even not respond at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In extreme examples, a person who is exhibiting these behaviors can get in trouble at work and be at risk of losing their job, which can also result in a cycle of shame and guilt, Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. You are continuously missing deadlines and meetings. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; PeopleImages / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If handing in work on time or even showing up to work is becoming a daily struggle, it could also be a symptom of depression, Howes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I knew someone who enjoyed his work, was actively engaged in his projects, and had a lot of contact with his coworkers. When he became depressed, he started sleeping through his alarm and showed up late to work. He was falling behind on deadlines, stopped going to lunch with colleagues, and became highly critical of his [own] and his co-workers’ performance,” Howes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“All of these changes were noticed by colleagues and bosses, who reached out to him and encouraged him to seek help,” Howes continued. “Fortunately, he did, and through a combination of changing diet and sleep hygiene, beginning therapy, and receiving a prescription for an antidepressant, he was feeling better within a few months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. You are having angry outbursts at work.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Skynesher / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Depression isn’t just feeling down in the dumps ― it can make you super irritable too,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If every little annoyance is setting you off at work, it could be a signal to look deeper at the cause. People with depression deal with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3959025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms of overt or suppressed anger;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;symptoms of overt or suppressed anger&lt;/a&gt;, and can make their colleagues the target of their ire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“At work, you may find yourself easily annoyed by everyone and everything. Your fuse is short with your co-workers, customers, and even your inbox,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. You lose motivation or interest in the work you used to enjoy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Vm / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s a difference between a one-time boring assignment and a worrisome pattern of apathy. Notice changes about how you feel regarding work that you used to take satisfaction in doing, Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You might notice yourself just staring at your screen, pretending to be busy, or doing anything but tackling the big stuff,” Garcia said. “That loss of interest that depression can cause may have you thinking ‘I just don’t care’ about your work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do next if you suspect you have depression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If these signs are resonating with your experience at work, know that you do not have to deal with depression on your own. There are steps you can take immediately to address how you are feeling and get better:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to what your body is telling you about your health. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If your depression shows up as you hyper-functioning at work, it helps to check in with your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It can be easy to miss depressive symptoms when work is tricking you into feeling competent and self-efficacious,” Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s why Velez suggests asking yourself questions that can help you notice changes in your physical health like: Are you feeling more tired than usual? What’s your relationship with alcohol or marijuana? Are you getting too little or too much sleep? How is your relationship with exercise and movement? Are there points of nagging tension anywhere in your body?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Physical signs and signals can alert you that it may be time to acknowledge those uncomfortable feelings,” Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to loved ones and trusted peers about how you’re feeling. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When you are depressed, you might not want anyone to know and may feel unworthy of your friends’ support. But in fact, talking to a few trusted peers and loved ones can be just what you need to help you against withdrawing and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The best way to start managing depression is to talk with someone about it,” Howes said. He said you could open up to a friend or loved one, and let them know what you’re experiencing and how it’s impacting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Velez said it can also help for employees experiencing depression to ask trusted colleagues to stop by their desk for a quick coffee chat a couple times a week or to check in with them via text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek professional help. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Know that depression is very common and often responds well to treatment,” Howes said. “If it seems like this is depression, talking with a physician or a mental health professional is crucial. They will be able to assess your symptoms and recommend a course of treatment that may include therapy, medication or both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With written documentation of your depression by a medical professional, you may also qualify for reasonable accommodations at your job under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Examples of these accommodations can include permission to work from home or an altered schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-boss-work_l_64a5846ae4b0dcb22c48cb1a" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;you choose to share your condition with HR or your manager&lt;/a&gt;, they may be able to help you get company-sponsored resources and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Many workplaces offer EAPs [Employee Assistance Programs] which have counselors on staff to provide short-term therapy or can also give the employee referrals for other services that may be needed such as child care, food and housing assistance, and therapists in the community,” Velez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess whether your job is making your depression worse. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Citing psychiatrist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9667129/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Aaron T. Beck;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Aaron T. Beck&lt;/a&gt;’s research on cognitive behavioral therapy, Velez said it is also important to learn if your job is providing you with the ability to feel pleasure, or a sense of enjoyment, and mastery, or a sense of achievement, because those are factors people need in order to combat depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To monitor if your job is exacerbating symptoms or is the source of them, Velez said an employee can keep track of work activities for one or two weeks in a spreadsheet, with one column for “pleasure” and another column for “mastery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Having visual evidence can be a great way to confirm or deny our feelings,” Velez said. “Taking an inventory can let you know if you are getting pleasure and mastery from your job or if it’s time to start looking for a new job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand that tiny wins do make a difference. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Depression often pushes you to isolate, do nothing, and be unkind to yourself. Doing the opposite, even in tiny ways, can really help,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, Garcia said that if you’re struggling to get out of bed and are showing up late to work, you can try sitting up when you wake instead of staying horizontal. And if projects feel overwhelming, Garcia recommended breaking them down into smaller steps or committing to just five minutes of focused effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, it helps to understand that you are more than your depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“See depression as something separate from who you are and practice resisting its urges,” Garcia recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The point is to remember that depression can be a tough mental health condition that affects &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7224a1.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:millions of people every day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;millions of people every day&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a manageable one. &lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/depression-job-signs_l_65dcc2cde4b005b858310eac" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nami.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Alliance on Mental Illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helpline is 1-888-950-6264 (NAMI) and provides information and referral services; &lt;a href="http://www.goodtherapy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoodTherapy.org;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;GoodTherapy.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an association of mental health professionals from more than 25 countries who support efforts to reduce harm in therapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 00:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPSGlPMUloX0ZnRWhpNTJ3cmJ4MEttQnZpQmFlRXFFZ3lSOVRBdnNIWmNKQmJhR2lDY0t5cG5XUE05dFV1UGpSTjlGVzZUajdscGVBai0wRWk0cXhwNWxOQmN0Q3gyOERxbkRGMm5qR0ZBSUFlSkF2Z3lEMU5BenpLZw</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，随着年龄的增长，大脑健康的头号营养素- EatingWell | The #1 Nutrient for Brain Health as You Age, According to a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxQdGtqeW1wRjRwVVNkUk9haW5KMXRoNGFBcy1DclhRVE5uektla1RlNkczY0FhYnNMaVpBZ3oxOVc4YmVCcFc5YUdyRGhGNzR0cGlsVkpWbkdUekU5elNXR2R2eEFXamxuTVZYRWZOTzlXVUR3N2VEenI0MU5yWkJOQWZ3Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you looking for ways to stay sharp as you get older? Maybe you've watched a loved one struggle with cognitive decline and want to avoid that. Or perhaps you simply want to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944120/best-exercises-for-brain-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;be proactive&lt;/a&gt; for your brain health. No matter what the reason, we see you. And one of the best ways to do so is by incorporating more omega-3 fatty acids into your diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;polyunsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; found in three main forms: Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). You need to consume these fats in your diet, as your body cannot make them in sufficient quantities on its own. Thankfully, seafood sources like salmon, fish oil and krill oil contain the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, while &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291962/8-best-vegan-omega-3-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based sources&lt;/a&gt; like walnuts, flaxseed and chia seeds contain ALA.

From promoting heart health to reducing inflammation, improving mental health, cognition and more, the benefits of these necessary fats are far-reaching.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one study, two in three Americans will experience some level of cognitive decline by the age of 70.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given the benefits omega-3s have shown so far regarding cognitive health, researchers are beginning to dive further into the effects this fat has on the aging brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before we dive into the science, here's a biology refresher. The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are critical components of cell membranes—meaning they play an important role in keeping the brain functioning and facilitating communication between cells. Simply put, they are a big deal when it comes to cognitive health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://facultyprofiles.tufts.edu/taylor-wallace" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Taylor Wallace, Ph.D., CFS, FACN,&lt;/a&gt; your body can produce around 10% of the amount of EPA and DHA you need from ALA that's consumed in your diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In other words, your body can convert ALA to EPA and DHA. However, as we age and with the onset of cognitive decline, this conversion rate starts to decline to less than 10%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "In both animal and human studies, when the diet is void of omega-3 fatty acids, the levels of DHA, in particular, in the brain decrease, accelerating aging and affecting memory," says Wallace.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But don't let this scare you, says &lt;a href="https://nomadistanutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mascha Davis, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. By incorporating omega-3s into your diet—yes, even starting today—you can begin to reap the benefits well into your future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Omega-3s act as a powerful anti-inflammatory agent. When we experience chronic inflammation in the body, cognitive health may decline, and age-related chronic disease conditions may increase. Adequate daily intakes of omega-3s have been shown to help to reduce inflammation in the body and thus protect against some age- and inflammatory-related conditions," says Davis.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After evaluating the available data focusing on the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on diet-related disorders, one report concluded that EPA and DHA supplementation has a beneficial impact on inflammatory markers, oxidative stress and brain health outcomes, among other positive effects.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another review had similar results, finding a link between omega-3 supplement intake and improvements in learning, memory, overall cognitive health and blood flow to the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In terms of disease prevention, one study found that higher blood DHA levels were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia. Genetic factors also seemed to influence the benefits of DHA supplementation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans advise consuming fatty fish, like salmon, at least twice a week. However, given that 90% of Americans don't come close to meeting their recommended intakes every week, it's important to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consider a fish oil supplement&lt;/a&gt; to help fill in the gaps.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Those following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026238/plant-based-vs-vegan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vegetarian or vegan diet&lt;/a&gt; can get EPA and DHA from algal oil supplements, which are derived from marine microalgae—the food source that fish use to store up EPA and DHA omega-3s in themselves.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's worth noting, though, that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;most supplements are underregulated&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to choose one that has independent verification to ensure label accuracy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both Wallace and Davis recommend a food-first approach for getting omega-3s but will recommend supplements when dietary intake is lacking as a practical way for people to meet their daily needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adequate intake recommendations for omega-3s haven't been updated in over 20 years. Keeping that in mind, the current guidelines recommend omega-3 intakes of 1.6 grams per day for men and 1.1 grams per day for women—but these numbers are reflective of ALA recommendations only. There are currently no U.S. government dietary recommendations for EPA and DHA.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that said, the American Heart Association recommends at least 250 mg per day of DHA and EPA to prevent heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, are critical for healthy aging and cognition. While more research is needed on the recommended amounts for optimum brain health benefits, no matter how old you are, you should consider upping your intake of DHA and EPA omega-3 fatty acids. It's never too late—or too early—to start!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can increase your intake by eating fatty fish such as salmon, sardines and herring at least twice a week and incorporating plant-based sources like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-8628392" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, walnuts and flaxseeds on a daily basis. If you don’t eat fish, consider taking a supplement. Most importantly, you should always speak to a healthcare professional before starting any supplements to ensure they’re safe and align with your health needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;According to health news website &lt;em&gt;Healthshots&lt;/em&gt;, fatty liver disease occurs when excess fat accumulates in the liver, hindering its ability to function properly. A small amount of fat in the liver is normal, but when fat content exceeds 5% of the liver’s weight, it can lead to conditions such as cirrhosis, non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Those who are overweight or obese are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Fortunately, fatty liver disease is a reversible condition. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, can help manage and reduce the condition. Below are five fruits that may aid in combating fatty liver disease:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Grapefruit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/5-fruits-that-support-liver-detoxification-4888511.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;grapefruit&lt;/a&gt; may help repair liver damage caused by fatty liver disease and assist in detoxifying the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Additionally, rich in antioxidants like naringin and naringenin, grapefruit helps reduce inflammation and protect the liver, benefiting overall liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/red-green-or-yellow-which-apple-color-is-best-for-you-4880449.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Apples&lt;/a&gt; are high in soluble fiber, which aids in reducing liver fat and facilitates detoxification. The polyphenols found in apples also help reduce fat accumulation in the liver, promoting better liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table align="center" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tplCaption" data-widget="obj"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img alt="Red and green apples.

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Avocado&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/life/wellness/is-freezing-avocados-a-good-way-to-preserve-them-4863703.html" rel="dofollow"&gt;Avocados&lt;/a&gt; are rich in healthy fats and contain phenols, which may help lower blood lipids and prevent liver damage, particularly in those with NAFLD. A 2015 study published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine reported that avocados might help lower the risk of metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and NAFLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Papaya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Papayas are packed with enzymes and vitamins that aid digestion and reduce the liver’s workload. By improving digestion, papaya allows the liver to function more efficiently and may help alleviate NAFLD, according to studies conducted on rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Kiwi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Normal"&gt;Kiwi is nutrient-dense and supports liver health with its powerful antioxidants. These antioxidants help prevent fatty liver diseases and protect the liver from damage, boosting overall liver function and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-component="true" data-component-type="tin_xemthem" data-component-value="4888511,4888603,4887058,4889628,4889637,4890060" data-thumb="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A PROCLAMATION&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-left"&gt;During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we celebrate the foundational role that physical fitness and sports play in helping us to live longer, healthier, and more fulfilling lives.  Through sports, fitness routines, and staying active, we have the opportunity to improve our health, strengthen our communities, and build a brighter future for our country. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For far too long, our Nation has failed to prioritize the health and well-being of the American people.  This negligence has come at a devastating cost.  As a result, the United States lags behind other developed countries in life expectancy, chronic disease prevention, and overall public health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This era of indifference ended when I took office.  I was proud to appoint Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services to urgently confront and stop this crisis.  I also established the Make America Healthy Again Commission, tasked with ensuring Americans have access to nutritious food choices, while addressing the root causes of childhood chronic diseases.  With public health as a cornerstone of my Administration, we are forging a future where the American people are healthier and stronger than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Engagement and active participation in sports, especially among our youth, is vital to fostering a culture of health and physical fitness.  My Administration is committed to ensuring that our sports and competitive spaces remain safe, free, and accessible for future generations of Americans.  In my first term, I signed an Executive Order to nationally expand children’s participation in sports, promoting physical activity, fitness, and the academic and social benefits of healthy lifestyles.  I was also proud to recently sign an Executive Order to keep biological men out of women’s sports, ensuring our female athletes are free to compete and excel on a level and fair playing field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, we are building a healthier and more flourishing Nation, one that champions physical fitness and well-being, empowering every citizen to reach their full potential and excel in all aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2025 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month.  I call upon the people of the United States to incorporate physical fitness and sports participation into their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-ninth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;DONALD J. TRUMP&lt;/p&gt;

I was sideswiped by a car, then ran over by the truck behind while cycling to work. I was essentially impaled by my right femur, which shattered my pelvis and shoved bone fragments into my guts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last thing I remember before I got knocked out for surgery, was the surgeon telling me everything was going to be fine, and it was all routine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I didn't wake up for a month. When I did, I was missing the entire left leg, and most of the muscle tissue in the right. I was too weak to move much, couldn't talk because I had a tube through my neck, and I was very uncertain about reality due to what I went through in my coma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Parades of doctors came to tell me how I should be dead, and it's crazy that I lived. I was told over and over that my survival was very much against all odds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; My surgeon on the other hand, never said anything like that. He always maintained that he was going to get me through. His attitude honestly helped when I had to go back to his table a few more times before I was done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For 4 years, I kind of blew off the people who made a big deal about my survival. I adopted my orthopedic doctors attitude. Then I met a woman who's in the medical field. I fell in love, and eventually trusted her enough to let her read my medical records. I had never read them, because it's a massive pile of paperwork.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; She broke down crying and couldn't read anymore. She told me that the beginning of my time in the hospital was full of the type of write-ups you find in the morgue. She told me that when they opened me up, bits of my pelvis fell out. I asked her to stop there. She won't read anymore, and I don't want to know anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I now know my doctor has one hell of a pokerface.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efayetj/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/usa-california-hawthorne-U73kZ5kDGCQ" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-5/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722455"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722455" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-1-682d98db2d69c-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker examining an X-ray with a focused expression while reviewing an unbelievable medical image." title="Medical worker examining an X-ray with a focused expression while reviewing an unbelievable medical image."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Years ago my then 11 year old shattered both femurs and her hip. At the time, her Orthopaedic specialist was so reassuring and confident that we had no doubts about her recovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A year later, we went back for a review and he asked me if I'd like to see her trauma x-rays. Not having any idea of the reality I said yes. What I saw looked like her leg bones had exploded. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After my freaked out reaction I commented on how cool and calm he was, and how certain that she'd be fine. He said he'd actually had to go for a short walk around the hospital to collect his thoughts since he had no idea how he would put this child back together. He also told me had used the films as a teaching aid.

It was at a soccer game, she crawled on top of a big dog called a borzoi, which startled it, it rolled over and bit her in the face. This was the late 80's, smaller town. There were no pediatric surgeons available, no plastic surgeons, she was in the ER with her face ripped open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyways, our general pediatrician (who is now my kids pediatrician, 30 years later), who had only graduated maybe 10 years prior, sewed her face back together. It was 30 stitches on the inside of her mouth, and 30 or so on the outside. She had a massive scar down the whole side of her face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anway, fast forward 15 years. She grew normally, her face is fine, her smile is fine, no long term damage. Apparently, a face is full of nerves and muscles, and thats why only plastic surgeons work on faces. Particularly with children, having nerve and muscle damage can make their face grow crooked as they age, it is a highly specialized field. But in this case, there was nobody else, just a general pediatrician, and he managed to save her face, with no long term nerve or muscle damage, or even scarring now that shes an adult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We found out 25 years later from our pediatrician's wife, that he spent an hour or so crunching his old med school books in the seat of his Plymouth Reliant in the hospital parking lot, studying facial anatomy, nerves and cheek structure, etc. He walked into the hospital and performed a multiple hour surgery, on her face, sewed it back together, perfectly. You would think a plastic surgeon did it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His wife told us he came home that night, just flopped down on the couch, and sat that there, amazed that he'd done it. Proud, but cautious. A new general pediatrician, sews a toddlers face back together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And it worked. Now, you would never know it happened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...and he has never, ever, done another surgery like that again lol&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;edit: if the tenses seem odd, it is because he was MY pediatrician then, and now that I am old and have a child, he is our daughters' pediatrician again. And he still calls my by my full first name which still drives me nuts. We chose him for his excellent medicine skills, not his personality. Thank you all for the gold and stories, I will share this with my sister and probably not him next time we see him, though I can promise you he doesn't know or care what reddit is. He doesn't even have a computer except the one he is forced to have at his clinic, and he calls it "henry", to spite the man who made all the doctors in his pediatrics group carry tablet pcs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efap6fb/" target="_blank"&gt; ikilledtupac &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-long-coated-large-dog-_Hzg9rquaIM" target="_blank"&gt; Karolina Wv / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-2/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722467"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722467" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-9-682d9e29e4d4a-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers in surgical scrubs performing an operation, staying calm while handling medical tools and instruments." title="Medical workers in surgical scrubs performing an operation, staying calm while handling medical tools and instruments."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;In 2011 I had a saddle pulmonary embolism two weeks before my scheduled wedding.

I was the lowest ranking, most clueless person in the department. I knew a lot about the Kreb cycle, not a whole lot about, you know, medicine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A young man came up to me and said he was sorry to disturb me, he just wanted to check, it was just, well, not to queue-jump or anything, but he wanted to check, can this definitely wait for triage..?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He then unwrapped a towel from his hand and showed me his thumb, which he had dropped a loaded barbell onto. It was shattered, just flattened, with splinters of bone coming out. I stared at it. He stared at it. I stared at it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I told him oh yes, no problem at all, he'd better take a seat and I'd make sure someone was with him right away.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaq50u/" target="_blank"&gt; Anytimeisteatime &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-working-on-a-machine-with-a-wrench-1qr6pAB8XdY" target="_blank"&gt; Giulia Squillace / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-6/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722463"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722463" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-7-682d9cbb8425e-png__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of numerous larvae wriggling in soil, illustrating moments medical workers pretended to be calm seeing something unbelievable." title="Close-up of numerous larvae wriggling in soil, illustrating moments medical workers pretended to be calm seeing something unbelievable."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;ER Tech here, a few months ago we had an elderly gentleman come in presenting with shortness of breath. As I was getting him into the gown and into hospital socks, I noticed very old, yellowing bandaging around his foot. I inquired to its purpose and he told me it was a large wound on the back of his heel that wasn't getting better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I asked him if I could unwrap it to inspect it/possibly re-wrap it (basic wound care is one of my duties), and it was a literal hole in his heel about 4cm in diameter, skin necrotic around the edges, with a large flap of skin covering the middle. I wasn't terribly shocked...until I swore I saw the skin flap writhe a little bit. I got the patient's consent to look under the skin flap and sweet galactic Jesus, there were 3 sizeable maggots just chilling. I've read about it before but I have never seen it in person. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My brain went "what in the solar f*ck" and despite my attempt at a poker face, the gentleman read my reaction and asked, "Is it that bad?" I was straight up with him and told him that the wound had maggots and needed immediate treatment and the poor guy started apologizing for "bringing something disgusting." I told him, "I see this more often than you think. Maggots are actually great at cleaning out dead tissue and are used as treatment sometimes." He seemed relieved by that but it was definitely my first time ever seeing a maggot infected wound. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efathfj/" target="_blank"&gt; lilrei160 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-bunch-of-bugs-that-are-laying-on-the-ground-4OqvD8Qr4Q8" target="_blank"&gt; Bernd / unsplash (not the actual photo)Dittrich &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722466"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722466" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-11-682d9f0b69280-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers in surgical gowns and masks performing an operation, staying calm while facing an unbelievable situation." title="Medical workers in surgical gowns and masks performing an operation, staying calm while facing an unbelievable situation."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Lots of stories, many already covered by others. I will share this particular story with my legs crossed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Motorcyclist came in after some one left turned without checking. He had gone over the hood, slid and somehow somersaulted landing on his a*s sitting up. He slid across intersection mostly on his a*s, getting serious road rash. Luckily he was only a block from hospital and ambulance. They pack him and bring him to the ER.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We end up cutting off his chaps and jeans and begin the cleanup of gravel and sand embedded in his thighs and a*s when all of a sudden, his testicles fall out of his s*****m. He had basically sandpapered a hole in his s*****m while skidding on his a*s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attending pauses, grabs the saline, irrigates s*****m and nuts, fondles them back into place while humming. I handed him some gauze to pack the wound and smiled at the patient who was under a local.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I went on break, went fetal and dry heaved. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efau9d4/" target="_blank"&gt; Assaulted_Fish &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-doctors-performing-surgery-in-a-hospital-a-g3xxk_t7s" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-12/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722477"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722477" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-19-682db04c6cdcd-png__700.jpg" alt="A medical worker wearing surgical cap, mask, and glasses, maintaining calm focus during a critical moment in the operating room." title="A medical worker wearing surgical cap, mask, and glasses, maintaining calm focus during a critical moment in the operating room."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had to have my leg rebuilt after a car accident and was eventually sent to Duke university for my surgery. My surgeon was supposed to be like the best orthopedic surgeon in the country, I think he used to work for the Baltimore ravens. Anyway all the doctors from my hospital at home were very unsure if I would even have a functioning leg let alone walk normal again. The first appointment at Duke that dude told me it was really not a big deal and he would have me fixed almost good as new. I honestly thought he was just trying to be nice and optimistic but he was very serious. 5 months later I was walking and learning how to run again. He said I was one of the most complicated surgeries he has had to do and a group of surgeons flew in to observe him do it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efasxzv/" target="_blank"&gt; burtrenolds &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-wearing-medical-mask-and-robe-UIp163xCV6w" target="_blank"&gt; JC Gellidon / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-23/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722498"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722498" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not the doctor, but the patient. In 6th grade, i contracted so many different forms of dysentery that I was placed into CDC quarantine while they tried to figure out where I got it. I was barely conscious throughout the whole time but all I remember is my doctor in my room with me, having hooked up my Wii and playing Brawl as I recovered. I had no clue that my parents were being investigated for child abuse or that I was in quarantine until a few months later, or that I had passed out and had been covered in vomit and s**t for hours before my mom found me and took me to the hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I ended up getting it from someone not washing their hands after handling a snake and then cooking dinner at my science camp. Wash your d**n hands people!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: I do work in the medical field, but I'm not a doctor so technically I am a medical professional. Also, I can't believe my top rated comment is about me being covered in various bodily fluids.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaxbrh/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr4k399 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-44/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722505"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722505" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;As a new nurse, I worked on a nephrology unit, which meant that we dealt with mostly patients who had kidney failure and needed hemodialysis three times a week to clean their blood. A patient was admitted through the emergency room and told me that he hadn't been to dialysis in 4 weeks. He had HIV, kidney failure, had lost custody of his kids after a messy divorce, and had no will to live. He planned to just stay in his home until he died. He probably wasn't far from it, but a neighbor, who hadn't seen him for a few weeks, peeked in the window and saw him sitting, unresponsive on the couch. They called 911 and he was brought to my hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three weeks is an insanely long time to go without dialysis. Dialysis removes toxins and excess fluid from your blood. Missing a session can leave you feeling sick and swollen. Missing 12 sessions can k**l you. This guy was SO swollen. I've never seen a person who was so full of fluid. He looked like that girl from W***y Wonka that turned into a blueberry. His feet and ankles were particularly massive. I wasn't sure that he'd live. Miraculously, after several dialysis sessions, he'd fully deflated. However, he was left with lots of loose skin afterwards, which had the fragile texture of an old balloon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night, he called me to his room and said, "I think my foot is bleeding". He was right. He'd slid down towards the bottom of his bed and used his legs to push himself back up towards the top. In doing so, the fragile skin on the bottoms of his feet and been totally sheared away, leaving only tissue and bone and so much blood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had no idea what to do, so I just called a Code Blue. The patient wasn't dead or dying, but no part of nursing school or practice had prepared me for an HIV+ patient who had ripped the soles of his feet off and was currently laying in a 3ft wide, rapidlu expanding, puddle of blood. I just needed to get a whole bunch of people to the room as quickly as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I threw on a waterproof gown and some gloves and held pressure on the bottoms of his feet with a towel until help arrived. They didn't know what to do either. We called in the general surgeon, who seemed to think we might be exaggerating the extent of the damage and blood loss. He told us he'd be there in an hour and just to hold pressure until it stopped bleeding. We soaked towel after towel until, finally, the surgeon shows up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He breezes into the room, moves my towel away, and says, "hmph". Then he reaches towards the patients foot, and pulls off a a HUGE, softball sized, blood clot. In that moment, time stopped. He held out his hand, holding the huge clot, and I, without really thinking about what I was doing, held my hand out too. He plopped the clot right into my outstretched hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the next moments, several things happened all at once. I realized I was holding a big, coagulated mass of blood. I started dry heaving. I dropped it on the floor. It splattered. The surgeon exclaims, "OH JESUS F**K", not in response to my gags or the fact that he was just splattered by the clot I dropped, but because the patient's foot is now profusely bleeding again. He darts off and tells us to get the patient down to the OR immediately. We get him down there and, on the way back, realize that he'd left a trail of blood down the hallways, into the elevator, and to the operating theater.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw the patient during my next shift and he jokes, "I thought you were going to pass out when the doctor handed you that mess!" to which I replied, "Sir, I was positive that you were about to bleed to death".&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efb160t/" target="_blank"&gt; NurseSarahBitch &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-51/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722461"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722461" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-5-682d9b2aaa6e4-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers wearing masks examining X-ray scans while pretending to stay calm in a clinical setting." title="Medical workers wearing masks examining X-ray scans while pretending to stay calm in a clinical setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Lady came in with possible stroke symptoms (numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, gail abnormalities).

Turns out she had a dissection the entire length of her abdominal aorta and going into her right femoral artery. Left femoral had an aneurysm and was beginning to dissect as well. She had formed a massive clot throughout her abdomen that was miraculously keeping her alive. Basically all of her organs were ischemic (dead).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 5 different teams showed up in the ER to see her.

Right before he should actually be leaving (this can be really annoying if there are people waiting), he says 'I need your advice. `i'm having s*x with my mother.' What do I say? 'Oh my god'? No, I didn't... I said, 'This isn't the first time someone has told me this.' This wasn't true. Turns out that he knew it was wrong, that mother had initiated it, he was trying to extricate himself, and he was desperate for help. But the thought that someone else had been in his position meant to him that he hadn't been judged, that he wasn't doomed or would go to hell, and that there was hope. But he didn't know what to do because the person to whom he should've looked for advice was actually his a****r.

My daughter, who was 3 at the time, had to have a cavity filled. As we were leaving, the dentist told me just to watch my daughter because sometimes kids chew their gums because it's numb and feels weird. So the drive home took 30 minutes and I had been talking to my daughter the entire time to keep her busy. I park my car in my drive way, opened the passenger seat to get my daughter out, and her entire lower lip on the left side is gone. She had chewed it off down to her chin. She ended up in emergency surgery, but the surgeon kept telling us it would be fine and he sees this stuff all the time. She ended up having multiple surgeries, and when she was finally healed, the surgeon told us that it was the worst injury like that he had ever seen. He wasn't sure how she would heal, but you can hardly tell it happened now.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efav67r/" target="_blank"&gt; imcloudnine &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/female-dentist-examining-teeth-of-little-girl-at-dental-clinic-mother-supporting-her-little-daughter-at-dentists-office-healthcare-2ni8EfJ9Bfg" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-38/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722462"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722462" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-6-682d9c4038ea0-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker wearing blue gloves handling medical tubing, showing calmness while seeing something unbelievable" title="Medical worker wearing blue gloves handling medical tubing, showing calmness while seeing something unbelievable"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Posted this before:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;4th year med student here. On my ER rotation a couple months back, I walked in to the ED and was immediately asked to help a nurse and resident put a catheter in a patient. Now a catheter placement is usually a one person job so I was pretty confused as to why they needed my help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I walk into the patient room, and I’m immediately greeted by a disgusting rotting flesh smell. Worst thing I’ve smelled in my life. The patient has to be pushing 400 lbs and has the worst edema (soft tissue swelling) from congestive heart failure I’ve ever seen. His s*****m and p***s f******n are about the size if a small watermelon, and the f******n had swollen completely over the tip of his p***s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nurse had a speculum (tool OBGYNs use to look inside vaginas) inserted into the man’s f******n while the resident took the catheter in a hemostat (pliers type thing) and jammed it into the man’s pee hole for 20 minutes. They finally got the catheter in and took the speculum out. It was covered in a thick brown discharge that looked like fermented p**s-s**t. I still don’t know how he let his s*****m and p***s swell that much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: We comforted the patient the whole time and kept telling him we had done it like this before. Total lie. No one in the ED had ever done or seen anything like it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaqetq/" target="_blank"&gt; Trisomy__21 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/close-up-of-medical-worker-with-drop-bottle-and-catheter-professional-female-doctor-in-uniform-at-hospital-diagnostic-and-clinic-support-healthcare-and-modern-medicine-concept-k5T21KKuDes" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-8/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722476"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722476" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-18-682daf81d0d05-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker with curly hair drying face with towel, pretending to be calm after seeing something unbelievable." title="Medical worker with curly hair drying face with towel, pretending to be calm after seeing something unbelievable."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;A little late to the party—&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not the worst, but I had a patient once with a stomach bleed and a small bowel obstruction. We had to put in an NG tube (tube that goes in your nose and down to your stomach) to drain/decompress his stomach, which was pretty distended and hard. &lt;br&gt;I’m inserting the tube and has soon as it hits this guy’s gag reflex he projectile vomits and SPRAYS very dark, half digested blood all over himself, the bed, the wall, and the floor. It’s basically a scene from the exorcist. I had to dive out of the way and somehow was unscathed. He couldn’t stop for almost ten minutes as we’re trying to get this thing down to where it needs to go. Finally finish placement and it immediately suctions out ~3 liters of this black sludge that is old, digested blood. Pt was mortified and we had to play it off like “oh no no it’s fine, it’s really common to vomit during the procedure. We’ll just go get some towels and clean you up!”&lt;br&gt;My coworker and I left the room and just stared at each other in silent shock.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efatxzv/" target="_blank"&gt; oh_haay &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-man-wiping-his-face-in-front-of-a-mirror-C09E-8WkjFE" target="_blank"&gt; Natalia Blauth / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-22/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722471"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722471" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-14-682da308b3bc9-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker pretending to be calm while comforting an elderly patient in a hospital room setting." title="Medical worker pretending to be calm while comforting an elderly patient in a hospital room setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I used to do psychiatric evaluations in an emergency room setting. One time, I'm evaluating this 60 year old woman who is lying in the hospital bed. I'm asking her questions, and she stops me and says, "Excuse me, but I need to pass some gas." I let her know that this is a medical setting and that is a completely normal body function and not to be embarrassed. People pass gas all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was not prepared for what came next. She let it rip, and out came the loudest, wettest, and longest sounding fart I have ever heard. It was bubbly and juicy, hitting all the deep notes while ending on a squeaker. I don't think Satan could have made a noise like that with his a**s. It sounded so relieving, but then the smell hit me. It was bad enough that I started to gag and had to excuse myself from the room. When I came back I politely asked if she needed a nurse for anything in case she needed to be cleaned up after that, but she declined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Obviously I've witnessed people farting before, but I've never heard or smelled anything like that before. That was something else.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efao1uo/" target="_blank"&gt; AimlessPeacock &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/an-elderly-patient-at-the-hospital-NNdO9o1qMN0" target="_blank"&gt; Curated Lifestyle / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-17/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722472"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722472" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-15-682da3965240e-png__700.jpg" alt="Person wearing a black hoodie holding a smartphone with a charging cable, illustrating medical workers pretending to be calm." title="Person wearing a black hoodie holding a smartphone with a charging cable, illustrating medical workers pretending to be calm."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Nurse in corrections here.

Come to find out, the prong of the phone charger got caught up into something and it was stuck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As i was trying to comfort him, I started to hear this vibrating sound.

The shot pellets ended up hitting everything but his heart - lungs, ribs, spleen, stomach, liver, pancreas, and large and small intestines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the OR, the attending surgeon told me to put my hand on his beating heart because that will likely be the only time in my medical career that I would touch a beating heart.

Friend of mine bought a house and I moved in with him to help fix it up, polish it and then maybe sell it. So we are in the backyard pulling weeds and cutting down vines and I see this 4 inch diameter vine with fuzzy roots attached to the brick, climbed all the way up the wall. I'm not a particularly country boy, more urban, but my friend had warned me of poison ivy in back of the house. I called him over and he said "oh don't worry, it doesn't grow that big". &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;He was wrong. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Less than a week later I'm covered, up and down both arms bad enough I look like a 3rd degree burn victim. It has gotten into my bloodstream and appeared on my legs, back, chest and even my feet (which all had been covered of course). I remember my GP looked at me with my shirt off and said in the most nonchalant voice "oh, that's not quite the WORST I've ever seen" with serious emphasis on the one word. It took me two weeks of steroids to even return to work and another two weeks to lose the last of the boils. I spent that time researching poison ivy and I have to brag, I'm an expert on how to track down and murder that f*****g plant. I hate poison ivy. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit - People are asking me for tips on killing the stuff. Go to your local hardware store and they will sell a container of poison ivy killer. The stuff is good but if you use it as directed I can guarantee the stuff will return time and again to haunt you. The vine originates underground, not very deeply though. Dig around (while covered in protective clothing etc) and find the main trunk of the vine. Drill holes through the vine about half the diameter of the stalk and space them about 3-5 feet (1-2 meters) apart. Pour the poison ivy killer directly into the hole. Do not dilute it. Just pour it right in. Soak the vine well, maybe 50-100ml or 1/4 - 1/2 cup, depending on the size of the vine. This should do the trick. Of course it will need to be dug up and out but it ought to be pretty dead within a week. If that doesn't do it, repeat the process a second time. Also, do this when there is no rain forecasted. Good luck and k**l it dead!&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit 2 - Also, it seems everyone either has a story about getting it all over and hating it (I'm so sorry for you!) or telling how they are immune to it. Fun fact about that, allergies change. You can be immune all your life and then one morning wake up allergic to just about anything. Funny story to illustrate this, I told someone about my poison ivy situation once and she told me about her little brother who was apparently not allergic. He would play pranks by grabbing it and rubbing it all over himself to try to convince other people that it wasn't poison ivy. He pulled the prank one day and had a wedding to attend two days later. He suddenly developed the allergy under the suit. Moral of the story, k**l the plant when you find it. Evil evil little b*****d... &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit 3 - Last tip I just remembered. If you go out in the woods and suspect you are going to encounter poison ivy etc at all, bring a can of spray deodorant with you. The aluminum chloride (I think that's the chemical) in it will neutralize the oil and prevent allergic attack. Otherwise scrub with soap and water within ten - fifteen minutes after exposure.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efard08/" target="_blank"&gt; TheMisterOgre &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/green-plant-on-selective-focus-photography-Z_JF_BjNbZY" target="_blank"&gt; James Whitney / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-26/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722484"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722484" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-24-682db2cfd425f-png__700.jpg" alt="Snowboarder dressed in winter gear riding through deep snow with medical workers reacting to unbelievable scenes concept." title="Snowboarder dressed in winter gear riding through deep snow with medical workers reacting to unbelievable scenes concept."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Not a medicalprofessional, but I have impressed a couple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not super weird but just uncommon I guess. I was overweight but active when I was younger and broke my lowest rib while snowboarding, long story short, I did not know it was broken (honestly) so I never got it checked by a doctor. The rib traveled up over the next 2 ribs and has since fused to them. I now have a permanent tilt on my spine where this rib attaches to it and now that I have lost some weight a bump you can see/feel on my chest. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is kinda weird when you tell a doctor about something on your body and their face lights up like a kid on Christmas and they ask for permission to feel it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efal3qx/" target="_blank"&gt; ptsfn54a &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photography-of-person-playing-snowboarding-during-daytime-9SGGun3iIig" target="_blank"&gt; Bradley Dunn / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-30/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722485"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722485" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-25-682db33749419-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker wearing surgical mask and glasses focused during a procedure, illustrating calm in an unbelievable moment." title="Medical worker wearing surgical mask and glasses focused during a procedure, illustrating calm in an unbelievable moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Years ago (2000) I was playing soccer and noticed a little skin irritation underneath my arm. I thought it would go away but it developed into a weird thing. It was about 2 in in diameter and grew to be a collection of essentially looked like hundreds of skin tags grew together in a little circle. I went to the doctor who didnt have a clue and he sent me to a specialist. While there it seemed like he didnt know either. This was further evidenced when 4 other doctors came in to take a look and were really interested. They took a ton of photos and told me they hadnt seen this before and couldnt really offer any medication and said they would monitor it. About a week later the 'skin tags' developed little circles on the top that turned into scabs within a couple days. Then, the thing just kinda dried up and fell off me. It was f*****g weird and to this day I have no idea what it was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was not comforted.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efapvbw/" target="_blank"&gt; negative_space_ &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/man-in-blue-and-white-collared-shirt-wearing-green-face-mask-odggKTyA5o0" target="_blank"&gt; National Cancer Institute / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-31/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722490"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722490" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-29-682db5dad2524-png__700.jpg" alt="Close-up of a medical worker preparing a patient's leg marked for surgery, demonstrating careful attention in a clinical setting." title="Close-up of a medical worker preparing a patient's leg marked for surgery, demonstrating careful attention in a clinical setting."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I had to see an orthopedist oncologist because I had two sarcomas. One in my left thigh in the sciatic nerve and one in my left pelvic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My surgeon said he would get both out and the most I would get would be a drop foot (where you can’t lift up your foot on your own). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went back two years later and my doctor told me he thought he would have to remove my leg because of how the sarcomas were enmeshed in my bones, muscle, and nerves. I honestly thought the whole time that it was an easy out. Though the two 10 hour surgeries may have been a clue that it wasn’t so simple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These days I have a limp as I’m missing half my left pelvic bone and most of my glute and thigh muscle- but I got to keep the leg!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efan6cq/" target="_blank"&gt; Resse811 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-medical-professional-examines-a-knee-injury-kKEHYN6gALQ" target="_blank"&gt; Judy Beth Morris / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-36/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722493"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722493" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was the patient in this case. Had pain in the lower right part of my abdomen that grew more serious over a few days. Eventually got so bad I nearly passed out and was on my bathroom floor screaming on the third night. That morning I felt much better and went to work, but felt the pain coming on again that evening. Also decided to go into work the next morning while running a fever that was getting steadily worse. Finally decided to go to the doctor, where they immediately referred me for a CT scan. My appendix had been ruptured for a day and a half at that point, and I had sepsis/gangrene/massive infection. I was in surgery within a few hours, but prior to that the nurse that was with me said, "Yeah, this will be no problem. You'll be fine." Surgery was ok, but was followed up with a bunch of time in the hospital on intravenous antibiotics. My primary care doctor called me while I was recovering and told me the CT scan was one of the worst they had seen. The doctors I saw post recovery all had a *holy s**t* look when they saw scans and read the surgeon's report. Kudos to that nurse who kept me calm before surgery. Don't screw around with lower abdominal pain.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efarrun/" target="_blank"&gt; blownapp &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-39/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722496"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722496" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Probably too late to the party, but I had a lady come in to the ER listed as “Multiple Medical Problems”. This usually means diabetes and the issues stemming from it or maybe bleeding issues from another disease or maybe odd blood tests results at a clinic. I hadn’t seen the patient yet, but the Dr. came to the nurse’s station asking who had room 15. I jumped up and followed him into the room. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I walked in and saw what I thought was a corpse. Then the patient’s eye swiveled over to look at me. She truly looked like one of the people they found in a concentration camp. I could see every bone and her body was twisted in a decorticate position with her jaw locked open. Then the smell hit me: rotting flesh, death, and body fluids. I struggled to keep a neutral face and not gag. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I tried to place a blood pressure cuff on her arm and her skin just started flaking off in my hands. I gagged. The dr. started removing her clothes to examine her. Her feet were black to the ankles. Her hip bones were poking through her skin and were black. The skin around her ribs was worn away to oozing muscle fibers. Her calves were incredibly swollen and the skin was splitting like ripped pants. I removed her Depends, and there was feces coating her entire genital area. Then the dr. went to remove a large bandage on her lower back. Her entire sacrum was exposed and the bones were BLACK! The skin around it was a black liquified mass. It smelled like nothing I’ve ever smelled. I can’t even describe it. The dr. Told her family I would clean up her ulcers and wounds in preparation for surgery (liar, no surgeon would operate on her). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I had no idea how to clean dead bone tissue and liquified skin (they don’t cover that in nursing school). When I went to clean her sacral area, all the liquified skin separated and oozed all over the bed. I really struggled to keep my s**t together. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Afterwards, I needed a moment in the supply closet to cry it out for a second. I had no idea the human body could breakdown so much without dying. I still think about that woman sometimes and what led to her living like that. It still breaks my heart.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efb1pnt/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-42/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722465"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722465" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-8-682d9d6350c07-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical worker covering face with hands, pretending to be calm while witnessing something unbelievable indoors." title="Medical worker covering face with hands, pretending to be calm while witnessing something unbelievable indoors."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I’m an RN who specializes in wound care. We see a lot of crazy things in my clinic. A common occurrence is a pilonidal cyst, which is an abnormal growth in you gluteal cleft (aka butt crack) that contains hair. It usually happens with younger ppl (say 13-20s) and is obviously very embarrassing to the patient. When we get them, they’ve already had the surgery to open and extract the cyst, so there’s a few holes left that we have to heal. One poor soul that came in had the worst post surgical “hole” I’ve ever seen. It was so big, it extended from the top of her crack to the top of her a**s, then our on either side about 12 centimeters. It was like the surgeon carved out most of her butt :( The patient was devastated, and I tried to comfort her by telling her she’s not the worst I’ve ever seen.

Had a homeless guy call saying he stepped on a nail "about a year ago". I could smell it from the door so I expected it to be bad, but when I went to pick up the leg by his heel there was just...nothing there. His foot just evaporated into pus and maggots and his metatarsals clinked through my fingers. While I'm standing there trying to comprehend what happened he just sighed and asked me to pick up his foot (what foot buddy?), put it back on. He said "it falls off a lot these days, but it still hurts so that's good right?" I had no clue what to tell him. The nurses thought it was hilarious that "the baby medic(that's me btw)" got grossed out.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaspn3/" target="_blank"&gt; Bronzeshadow &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/exhausted-doctor-after-very-long-shift-in-the-hospital-dKWAjrJ_7ok" target="_blank"&gt; Getty Images / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-15/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722470"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722470" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-13-682da00a3df20-png__700.jpg" alt="Young medical worker covering face with hand, pretending to stay calm while seeing something unbelievable." title="Young medical worker covering face with hand, pretending to stay calm while seeing something unbelievable."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Had a patient who needed a lower gi study to find/fix a bowel bleed. To get a study done you need to poop clear mucus. Three days we bowel prepped with heavy laxatives and enemas. He barely pooped anything. He puts on the call light at 6:45, 15 minutes before my shift ends. He calmly says, "I kinda want to try and poop." He said it so casually I figured he was going to toot out another gas bubble and walk back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He stood from the bed, took one step, and the floodgates burst. 3+ days of the most rancid liquid stool I had ever encountered. It just wouldn't stop. He left a river of stool from the bed to the bathroom, coated the walls as he bend to park his butt on the toilet, and continued to dump out 7 people worth of poop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my 9 years I have never seen that much come out of a person. He was not a large man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was so embarrassed but I just kept my face as solid as possible, grabbed half the linen closet and 3 packages of cavi wipes, and sopped it up.

When I was getting treated for cancer I got a really bad case of pneumonia and had to be intubated and put into like a semi-coma type deal (I don't remember anything that happened in those six days but I was apparently made sober enough to open my eyes for visitors every day so I don't know if that counts as a coma). It was some pretty serious pneumonia because it was like less than two days between my first cough and them making the call that I would need to be intubated to stop me from drowning in my own fluids, so they didn't mess around and gave me a ton of antibiotics. You know how some hospital beds have a track along the ceiling that they can hang IV bags from? I had enough antibiotics hanging from mine that it broke and fell to the floor (again, no memory of this).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the thing that was truly unprecedented occurred when they were changing out my butt-bag (I don't fully understand what it was but they had something on or under my butt that collected all my bowel movements, they put it on after I was heavily sedated, and removed it before I was totally awake so I don't really remember it). For anyone who doesn't know, antibiotics can cause a lot of diarrhea. Apparently when they rolled me on my side that day I let loose a fire-hose of liquid s**t that arched through the air across the room and splattered all over the door and window which were about twelve feet away from my bed. I think it's super cool and funny so they didn't have to pretend like it was normal to comfort me.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaht4f/" target="_blank"&gt; FlutestrapPhil &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-hospital-room-with-a-bed-and-a-monitor-CjgwW0VR3d0" target="_blank"&gt; Frederic Köberl / unsplash (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-24/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722479"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722479" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-21-682db135f113e-png__700.jpg" alt="Medical workers showing calmness while holding a child, capturing genuine emotions in an unbelievable moment." title="Medical workers showing calmness while holding a child, capturing genuine emotions in an unbelievable moment."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Medical student here.

Three firefighters and a police officer were on top of a man who was prone and naked from the waist down. They immediately told my partner and I to restrain the patient to the gurney because the patient was combative. It turns out he took something thinking it was weed but turned out to be laced with something else (possibly PCP?). During his trip he attempted to cut his p***s off, but wasn’t successful. As fate would have it, I knew the patient personally and tried to comfort him on the way to the hospital. During the ride he became somewhat cognizant and was ashamed of himself. I tried to comfort him as I held his p***s in place.

I was particularly lucky in nursing school and got to watch open heart surgery, joint replacement, kidney removal, all kinds of neat stuff right over the surgeon's shoulder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only one that ever gave me a problem was this kid about 10 years old getting his tonsils removed. The doc had this hooked knife, he's reach into the kids mouth, hook the tonsil, and yank it back to cut it out. Blood flying out of the unconscious kid's mouth. So I'm standing there, I look up and all of a sudden everything's getting sparkly. I just said "I need to leave. Right now."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surgeon takes his tools out of the kid's mouth and says "OK. Someone please walk him out, thanks." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I learned that for some reason, I get queasy when it's kids being hurt. Which is funny, because I was a pediatrics nurse for quite a while after school.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the actual story. I wasn't even at work, but maybe four years ago, was living with my girlfriend at the time and her three young boys. That day, the youngest (about 7), had been climbing up a big lilac bush in the yard that I'd trimmed the day before. He slipped and fell out. A sharp, cut branch caught him in the face on his way down. I was in the kitchen, and heard this blood-curdling scream and ran outside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I brought him in, sat him on the kitchen table and took a look. It seemed like he was pretty lucky, there was just a deep cut on the bottom of his nose. Well, it was bleeding pretty decently so his mother and I took him to the emergency room.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We get there, there's only a physician's assistant on duty. He takes a look and thinks maybe it could use a couple of stitches. Or, he says, he could call the on-call ENT surgeon for another opinion. We told him that, all due respect, we would like to have a surgeon take a look, just in case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good thing we did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boy had nearly taken his entire nose off his face. The stick cut up under the nose, and traveled along under the flesh up to the bridge. The entire nose was hanging by a half inch of skin at the top. We just hadn't moved it much.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As soon as the surgeon came in and pulled this little boy's nose off his face, while he's laying on the exam table screaming absolute bloody murder, suddenly I got really hot, things start getting hazy, I realize I'm about to pass out. So I quickly exited the room and sat down, at the exact same time as my girlfriend, who was also a nurse. Neither of us could take it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaj1mk/" target="_blank"&gt; Gullex &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-28/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722488"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722488" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-28-682db581e748a-png__700.jpg" alt="Newborn baby wrapped in a blanket yawning, a common sight for medical workers staying calm in surprising moments." title="Newborn baby wrapped in a blanket yawning, a common sight for medical workers staying calm in surprising moments."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I'm a nurse and I work in a pediatric ER. A young woman brought her baby in to be seen for vomiting. I ask her to put the baby on the scale.

She said it matter of factually like it was no big deal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Que up calls to the police, CPS and a 1:1 sitter for the child and the mom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When all was said and done the baby was fine and turned over to her grandmother so no worries there. I have no idea what happened to the mother. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't believe she was intending to hurt the child.

I obviously didn't treat the patient myself, but I discussed his case with his doctor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The patient had severe anxiety and therefore hadn't been to a doctor of any kind in approximately twenty years. He ended up in our office because his wife had called the day before and expressed that he needed to be seen due to a foot infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he arrived, he approached the window and told the receptionist that he was sorry because his socks were dirty as he hadn't made it to the laundromat recently, which was a bit weird in and of itself, but we work for a podiatrist--we've seen it all before, as it were. He then sat in the waiting room, and it was mere moments before the smell seeped into the administration office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The receptionist put him in an exam room as quickly as possible, and upon her return, she informed me that the infection was literally oozing out of his sneaker. All we could do was open the widows and apologize to other patients as they arrived. It was foul, and when I entered the room after his appointment to clean it (the medical assistant was out that day), I immediately began gagging and had to forcefully push my manager out of the way as to avoid vomiting on her on my way to the restroom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As it turned out, the dude had had the infection for approximately three months, and had been showering with his sock on since he'd discovered it. He literally hadn't removed his sock from his infected foot in three months, and his wife had somehow been living with the overwhelming smell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The doctor said it was the worst infection he'd ever seen, but the patient was so incredibly anxious that he got the standard, "I've seen it all before," throughout his appointment.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efat2ul/" target="_blank"&gt; MedusaExceptWithCats &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-49/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722504"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722504" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Yep.

One called it a ticking time bomb. His heart had 2 chambers instead of the normal 4. He didn't have the big arteries that led from the heart to the lungs but a series of smaller ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will never forget the first time I saw him take his shirt off and you could literally see his heart beating in his skinny chest. Literally, every beat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the age of 25, 3 years after we were married, the time bomb blew. 7 years later I very vividly remember his chest moving as his f****d up heart beat.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efay1co/" target="_blank"&gt; ZoraTheDucky &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-53/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722508"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722508" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;In dental school, I had an emergency patient come in, complaining of sore gums. Upon examination, I found a massive calculus bridge (google it for pictures) behind her lower front teeth. She only had about 3 remaining lower teeth, but they were all connected with a whitish brown mineral deposit that was about the size of a golf ball. She had never had her teeth cleaned and she was probably 55 or so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I basically performed an emergency cleaning. She could speak so much better afterwords. Of course I had to play it off like it was normal, but in my years of practice I still haven’t seen a case that bad again. Get your teeth cleaned people. Even if you can’t afford every 6 months, once a year, or every other year is a hell of a lot better than never.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efawcda/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-54/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722511"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722511" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Worked in a heart procedure lab that helped try to get rid of bad heart rhythms. A prisoner came in for a last ditch effort to help his failing heart and had developed a condition called Ventricular Tachycardia. Setting the patient up and looking at his rhythm / heart, it looked pretty bad. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Before we got started he grabbed me on the arm and said "I'm scared. Is it going to be okay?" &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"We have very talented physicians here sir, and they do this all the time."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ventricular Tachycardia was set off during the procedure and deteriorated into Ventricular Fibrillation.

I got the cart set up for a vaginal exam, got her vitals, blood and urine (she couldnt pee because of the pain she said), all the basic jazz you do when someone comes into the ER. I process my samples and let the nurse know everything is done and she goes to talk to the woman and it essentially goes as this: no, she hasn't had any trauma, no no a*****t, no she doesn't know what's going on, but it started about 3 weeks prior. Long story short, we get the Dr as the woman refused to let the nurse take a look, and we are all in the room when the Dr turns the light on under the drape and immediately asks if she's been using any medication vaginally, there's clearly a lot of irritation and swelling as well as a VERY strong odor and she hadn't even inserted the spec yet. The woman says no, nothing. At this point the nurse goes to get some saline and I'm left to hand off tools and handle any swabs. The first swab handed to me was literally tinged a pale green, clearly infection. I'm capping it and the woman smells the odor slowly filling the room finally and starts apologizing. I had to say while trying not to gag "no no need to apologize, I've seen much crazier things, just relax and we will get you all fixed up." Well, the nurse comes back with saline and the Dr starts essentially flushing this woman's v****a trying to clear out all this discharge and infection so she can see what's going on, and all of the sudden she stops and asks if she's SURE she hasn't been putting anything in her v****a to treat any medical condition, even something not given by a Dr. And that's when we found out for about a month, this woman had been douching with a bleach and water mix to try and cure a yeast infection, because she read that "in hospitals we wash down with diluted bleach to k**l germs and thought it would work." She was riddled with chemical burns and infection and was immediately transported to a bigger hospital. So yeah, that happened. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efatinp/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-14/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722487"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722487" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medical-never-seen-so-bad-before-stories-27-682db4485f40c-png__700.jpg" alt="Blurred runners in motion during a city marathon with medical workers on standby for emergencies and support." title="Blurred runners in motion during a city marathon with medical workers on standby for emergencies and support."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Obligatory not a medical professional, but a first aider. I was doing a duty at the finish line of the London marathon as I have done for many years. I've seen enough chafing, dehydration and blisters galore. Someone always has the worst of the day but it happens so fast that you can hardly mentally tally who's nipples were the most raw.... &lt;br&gt;Until I had a runner come in covered in blood complaining that her nipples had completely gone. She had chafed so bad that her nipples and areolas were rubbed to nothing... And the worst part was that she had her nipples pierced and the piercings had EMBEDDED THEMSELVES IN HER EXPOSED BREAST TISSUE. &lt;br&gt;I had to talk her through sterilising the wounds while trying to assure her that 'it happens to everyone'.

I got called in on a Saturday for a lady who had an infection from a component separation. Basically they put a giant piece of mesh in you for hernias. I wasn’t prepared. When we lifted up her gown.... the smell wafted and I have never almost puked before until that moment. About 20 cm circle around her umbillicus was black and necrotic. It was absolutely awful. We basically removed the entirety of the necrotic tissue all the way down to the peritoneum. Just gray and black slimy mass of fat and skin. The worst part is that I had to measure the necrotic tissue and it requires me to lean in a little close to it. The surgeon was laughing because I was green when I got back to the surgical field. Then during that surgery another person who had the same procedure had come to the ER with an infection. AND THEN A THIRD! We stopped using the mesh because that’s what was getting infected.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efasneb/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-37/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722495"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722495" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;ER RN here. So, so many:&lt;br&gt;1) vaginal discharge the color and consistency of guacamole stuck on a speculum post-pelvic exam. The patient’s husband had recently been released from a period of federal incarceration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) The first time you smell a really funky, long-term GI bleed (bleeding into the intestines, usually the colon). P*o + blood = murder most foul. And the patient is sometimes a sweet, incredibly sick little granny watching us gag as we clean her up, apologizing for the smell, and we have to just say, from behind the peppermint oil-soaked mask, “oh sweetie, it’s okay, we do this all the time...”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) Dead, sloughed intestinal lining. Another smell that will haunt your daymares. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the winner winner chicken dinner in the “No, no... it’s not that bad... I’ve seen worse...” category was the homeless dude who came in complaining of blood in his urine. He wasn’t able to pee more than a few drops at a time, so we used a little ultrasound machine to see how much urine was in his bladder. More than 1000ml... you just bought a catheter sir. I tasked one of our male patient care techs with the job and had barely gotten back to the desk when he came running out yelling, “I need some HELP! Grab gloves!” &lt;br&gt;I lifted the gown covering this guy’s junk and grab the p***s to help...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MAGGOTS. IN. THE URETHRA. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And he was pissed off that we removed them because, “...in the Corps in ‘Nam, they teach ya to eat yer maggots! That’s free protein, dammit!”.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efapics/" target="_blank"&gt; benzodiazaqueen &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-41/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722499"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722499" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not my story but my SO was in training as a Nurse's Aide. &lt;br&gt;On her first internship, she was assigned to the ER at a trauma center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first person, on her first shift, of her first internship (of 3), was an older homeless man, complaining of his foot hurting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the medical staff took a quick look at the foot, they didn't initially see anything wrong, so they tried to remove his pants to examine the leg. &lt;br&gt;The pants didn't move. They were fused to his skin from the middle of the hip all the way down to his calf. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had to surgically remove his jeans by basically cutting the skin around the point where it was fused, and the moment the scalpel made the first incision, she described it as "As if Slimer from Ghostbusters barfed out of his leg." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently, there was enough gushing, green fluid, filled with maggots, that it covered the floor in the (small) examination room, and the nurse ran out of the room gagging. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After getting over the initial shock, they managed to peel a good amount of the skin off with the pant leg, and revealed that his lower leg had basically rotted all the way to the bone, and was full of maggots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently that's the moment when she knew she was meant for the job. Even the surgeon was having a pretty hard time keeping his composure, but she was fine. More fascinated than anything, and apparently not affected by bad smells as most people are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They had to tell him his leg was going to be OK - he was severely mentally ill and might have freaked the hell out - despite knowing he could die from the infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently he survived and they managed to save the leg, which is beyond incredible.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efav3b3/" target="_blank"&gt; Bonghead13 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-45/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722502"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722502" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Orthopedic Xray tech here.

Apparently the surgeon had a photo taken, post extraction, where he is cradling my dad's ~22.0 lb spleen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To top it off, one day into recovery, when doing on of those "gentle push on the abdomen" type exams on him, my dad's sutures catastrophically failed and he let loose a spray that coated the doctor, his nurse, and a good portion of the ceiling. Luckily for dad, the hospital staff was on point that day and kept him alive despite his body's best effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I heard all of this from the doctor while he was removing the line of staples (that went from c****h to sternum) some weeks later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dad didn't like to share, apparently.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efauzo8/" target="_blank"&gt; CallousJack &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-55/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722517"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722517" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was working as a CNA in a nursing home. There was a lady who had been neglected before she came in so she had stage 4 bed sores (all the way to the bone) and the treatment nurse wanted me because I am calming and really good with the residents that needed a little support. She has me roll her on her side and then carefully peels back the bandage. I'm staring done in half horror/ half fascination as I can clearly see the bone, ligaments, muscle, layers of skin... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm gawking hard and the nurse is showing me some neat procedure when I hear a small, frail voice, "Is it getting better?" I turn on my biggest, friendliest smile and reply, "It does! It looks SO much better. Does it feel better?" She smiles and nods; I change the subject to grand kids (she had a picture of them). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven't seen anything like it before or since. But she was such a lovely lady and I started looking forward to helping because she was such a nice lady to talk to.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efaw0l6/" target="_blank"&gt; dotchianni &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-63/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722520"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722520" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;A patient had an abscess on his arm about the size of a softball that had burst and was rotting and necrotic, he had also been sitting in a pool of his own s**t p**s and vomit for 3 weeks.

He'd been to the ER, they discharged him and said just the usual bumps and bruises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did my round of X rays, and his femoral heads were broken on both sides. Think of the leg bone as a capital L, with the bottom of the L hooking into the hip- his were cleanly broken through the bottom sections on both sides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out he'd had occult fractures on both sides the X rays didn't initially see, and walking on them collapsed them. Never seen that before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another was a patient with shoulder injury, both sides. Got an MRI, and both shoulders were basically destroyed. Complete failure of the rotator cuff on both sides, with the humerus being drawn up and back on each side.

So basically you could just have a look at him and tell that something was very, very wrong.&lt;br&gt;He stuttered that his wife was absent so he took some time to watch ''some videos of a certain s**y type online that inspired him''. Internally I started screaming, but on the outside I just nodded and acted like it was something I heard routinely. He proceeded to explain to me he had seen a video of someone putting a metal rod up his urethra and tried the same. But he used too much lube and it slipped inside. I remember stopping breathing for a second. He was just so embarrassed that I told him that this happens sometimes and we had seen it before. Well, no. Stuff up the butt, yeah, we see that. But this was a first. I pulled up the ultrasound machine hoping this was just a training situation by my attending to prank me, but nope, there was a glorious 10 cm long pen inside this man's bladder. &lt;br&gt;So he had hoped to have it extracted magically at the ER and then to go home. Well, he had to have surgery and stay overnight, his wife eventually found out. I kept the picture of the ultrasound as a souvenir and this memory as a great story to tell friends when they ask how my ''routine life'' is going as a (now) doctor.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efar49f/" target="_blank"&gt; chocpretzel &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-60/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722516"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722516" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I’m a surgeon. &lt;br&gt;A couple of years ago they send us this guy (52 yes old) that had shown up in the ER because he allegedly hadn’t pooped in a week or so. &lt;br&gt;To make a long story short X-ray showed he had SOMETHING lodged in his r****m (and sigma, and descending colon... so way up there) that was a little over a foot long. &lt;br&gt;He denied having put anything up there. Yeah, right.&lt;br&gt;We try to go from the bottom up and nothing. We see something but we can’t clamp onto it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So.

I used to get really bad ear wax buildup, so occasionally it would get enough that I'd go and get them cleaned out at my local clinic. The poor guy who was stuck doing it for me, really young-looking so probably still a student, at one point says under his breath, "God, this is so gross."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: Less related, but I remembered another story involving this guy. I went in once and they needed to do a strep test. I have a really strong gag reflex, so I warned him about it before he did the test. Dude looks me dead in the eyes and says, "You're not going to gag.".&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efask8t/" target="_blank"&gt; itsbeck &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-65/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8722521"&gt;  &lt;p id="8722521" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I was the patient. In middle school I somehow coughed so hard it tore a small hole in my lung. Everyone assured me it was more common then you would think, and that it's actually not to hard to fix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believed them until they asked if the med students could observe. Well of course!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About 30 of them filed in, lined up, and took turns squeezing my neck (where the escaped air ended up settling), and going "hmmm" "well would you look at that" and "oh my".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After they left I told my doctor "You know, for how common this apparently is, all those students seemed pretty interested in it." He replied with a half guilty grin and a nod, like yeah bud I caught you but can't really blame you for trying to calm me down.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/al2zw8/medical_professionals_of_reddit_when_did_you_have/efats8x/" target="_blank"&gt; BoredsohereIam &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-8616-67/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 23:02:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9FSS1iektLQmlSSjVLWUpGRHU4WVNDeGRRa1A1WHhmRnhWQld6ZkdkMkhIMWxFSzVtVjAwZHFRUWdGTUhYZEI2UFJjMHVUTHpndEI5ek9kWG5oRjRMYlRHd1RQNmpvb2ttcXRuNHFRa2dINTNhSFA0</guid></item><item><title>在弗吉尼亚州确诊的第二例麻疹病例- WTOP | 2nd case of measles confirmed in Virginia - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQNFNhWHJxNHhWdlFfVXVhcllUeFJUVS1UeW5nOU8wc0FON3VCUWtZYjBWaUxfWWpFVFh4dXBrSjZoMnhhbVNJLTRQSW1lNnZSLXdjNFg2cEdQX2Vpc2ZHRXdpRGhRdGFUTU9CSGF0MlJyeFNEV21FZk1Ha3pKLWNDeG0tUjd5ZnJYSXhmYjBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;A second case of measles has been confirmed in Virginia this year, health officials said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A second case of measles has been confirmed in Virginia this year, health officials said on Friday. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Virginia Department of Health said it was a teenager from the northwest region of the state who had recently traveled outside the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials released the following locations and times of when and where the teen could have exposed others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charlottesville Albemarle Airport between 2:15 and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play it Again Sports store on 1885 Seminole Trail in Charlottesville between 2:40 and 5 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodwill Store and Donation Center on 440 Gander Drive in Charlottesville between 3:10 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UVA Health Primary Care Riverside clinic on 2335 Seminole Lane, Suite 200 in Charlottesville, from 2 to 7:10 p.m. on Thursday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UVA Health University Medical Center Emergency Department on 1215 Lee Street in Charlottesville between midnight and 6 a.m. on Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2025/04/virginia-department-of-health-warns-of-potential-measles-exposure-in-woodbridge-fredericksburg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the first measles case was reported in Virginia&lt;/a&gt; — a child under 4 years old who possibly exposed other people in clinics in Fredericksburg and Woodbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/blog/2025/05/23/virginia-health-officials-confirm-second-2025-measles-case-in-the-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Virginia Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; said, “measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should contact your health care provider immediately if you have symptoms of measles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday that there are 1,046 confirmed measles cases, up 22 from last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;Texas, where the nation’s biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed only 10&lt;/a&gt; more cases this past week for a total of 728.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mexico-canada-ontario-0956a30c043b030ae79bc9f67c6ce89c"&gt;major outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in North America. One in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=323859266e21469b8b97a294d6c6f98e&amp;amp;sc_lang=en"&gt;1,795 cases&lt;/a&gt; from mid-October through May 20, an increase of 173 cases in a week. Another in Alberta, Canada, has sickened &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/measles"&gt;538 as of Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/mexico-measles-vaccines-misinformation-mmr-mennonites-misinformation-ea6158b9a4d513b20f33cbc09034e5c2"&gt;Mexican state of Chihuahua&lt;/a&gt; had 1,578 measles cases and three deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

Next week, protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s called “vibrio,” which covers as many as 12 kinds of bacteria in our waters and on the things we take from our waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection it causes is called “vibriosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No two men know vibriosis better than Richard Empson and Cornell Arceneaux.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Both are survivors. Some infected with one among the 12 in this group of bacteria have not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both have stories to tell, stories they hope will prevent fishermen and beachgoers the pain they have endured, and spare some the agony of an even worse fate for their families.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;It was 2016, Empson was wading in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, vacationing and fishing with his family. It was summer and warm coastal water — water temperatures above 70 degrees — is primed for one of this bacteria’s killer — vibrio vulnificus , the flesh-eating bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months later, sometime in August, Empson attended Sunday Mass at St. Thomas More in Baton Rouge. Each hand clutched a walking cane. He needed both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Got vibrio,” he said. “At the hospital (in Mississippi) I was told, ‘Your leg or your life.’ I chose life.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Empson said he believes vibrio vulnificus attacked his right leg on the fifth fishing day.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“My grandson fished every day just like me, but his immune system must have been stronger than mine,” Empson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began feeling symptoms that night. They packed up the next day, and he said he believed he could make it to Baton Rouge for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We left about 11 (a.m.) and I told my grandson to find a hospital nearby. I couldn’t make it home. We got to the emergency room in Bay St. Louis, and when they found out we’d been at the beach, they were calling for a surgeon, and they immediately moved me into intensive care.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said a doctor looked at his leg, saw blisters forming and told him he had a two-hour window “...t o receive medication to counteract what was happening. Otherwise, they would have to amputate the leg. He told me I had a 20% chance of the medication working, and I told him to take the leg, that I could learn to walk again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks in the hospital and more weeks of rehab in Baton Rouge left him with two canes. Now, he needs one to get around, to do yard work and fish – “I fish only from the bank. I still have a boat, but haven’t been in it for years. I still want to fish.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“The only thing I can’t figure is that I didn’t have a scratch on my leg, and the (hospital) staff believe it entered through my pores.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux, a never-say-die fisherman, is a three-time victim, twice from cuts while handling shrimp and crabs, and once after eating raw oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The external variety, the vulnificus, is much more virulent than vibrio gastroenteritis, the strain from raw shellfish, although Arceneaux tells of a lawyer he knew who ate an oyster poboy and was dead 24 hours later.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux’s advice is to be cautious when buying live bait.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“Live-bait tanks in the marina are a petri dish for staph, strep and vibrio,” Arceneaux said. “Handling shrimp in contaminated watercraft is the way I got vibrio the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second time I was handling five dozen crabs to entertain friends. I kept the crabs in a crab call (a basket submerged in water next to his camp) and I got a scratch on my arm. That was on a Thursday and within 24 hours I was on the way to the hospital and had surgery within two hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="5"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a photo of Empson is easy on the eyes, and easy to show the near-immediate effects of this virulent strain of vibrio, images of Arceneaux’s arm split open – a surgeon removed all the dead tissue — is gruesome. Even the image of scars running from hand to shoulder are not for the squeamish.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“It was 36 hours at the Baton Rouge General for the next one. To survive, I’m lucky twice, very lucky,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;While coastal water is the usual contact point for vibrio, Empson said his support group in Baton Rouge has a member who lost a leg after getting vibrio from False River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The CDC says…&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has pages devoted to vibrio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among its key points is that vibrio’s variety of bacteria “naturally live in coastal waters,” that you can get vibriosis after swallowing the bacteria or getting it in a wound, that the bacteria count is higher in coastal waters from May through October, and, if you suspect an infection, to seek medical care immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="6"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency estimates around 80,000 cases of vibriosis occur each year in our country, and 52,000 cases come from eating contaminated food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common gastric signs/symptoms are watery diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The signs of bloodstream infection include fever, chills and the two indicators for Empson, dangerously low blood pressure and blistering skin lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;And, for wound infection, signs/symptoms are fever, redness, pain, swelling, warmth, skin discoloration, leaking fluids discharge and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the CDC warns about preexisting conditions, complications like liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV, thalassemia; taking medicine to decrease stomach acid levels; and, recent stomach surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="7"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vibrio vulnificus, the CDC’s warning is clear: “Many people with the infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arceneaux said he continues to fish and enjoy oysters, the latter only when coastal water temperatures dip below 70 degree.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;He said he carries enough hand sanitizer, a chlorine bleach-water mixture and antibacterial soap on his fishing trips to immediately treat scratches.

						Health officials in Provincetown, Massachusetts, issued a warning of potential exposure to hepatitis A on Saturday, after a food service worker was infected with the virus.In a statement, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH), Barnstable County Department of Health and Environment and the Provincetown Board of Health warned anyone who dined at The Red Inn at 15 Commercial St. in Provincetown between April 30 and May 15, that they may have been exposed to hepatitis A and should contact their healthcare provider.According to the DPH statement, the food service worker at the restaurant who worked during those dates has a confirmed infection with the hepatitis A virus.As hepatitis A is highly contagious, the DPH urged customers who may have been exposed to the virus to contact their health care provider immediately to receive appropriate medical treatment.The DPH said preventive measures against the hepatitis A virus include the hepatitis A vaccine and hepatitis A immune globulin.However, the DPH said these are generally only effective at preventing hepatitis A infection if given within two weeks of exposure, prior to symptom onset.The DPH said early signs and symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice (dark urine, yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes). Hepatitis A typically varies in severity, with mild cases lasting two weeks or less and more severe cases lasting four to six weeks or longer.Additionally, the DPH said some people, particularly children, may not develop jaundice and may have an illness so mild that it can go unnoticed.However, the DPH said even mildly sick people can still be highly infectious, and people who become sick with hepatitis-like symptoms should consult a health care provider, even if the symptoms are mild.Hepatitis A can be spread between people through food handling, and the DPH said it can be spread by contaminated food and beverages. The DPH advises customers who dine at The Red Inn between April 30 and May 15 to practice thorough handwashing, especially before preparing food, to avoid any potential further spread of the virus.

It's a notion that a wealth of science backs up, and now a new study may shed more light on how this link between a parent's past trauma and a child's upbringing might manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists and other scientists have been studying the ways trauma can be passed down for years now, and much of the science has shown that it goes far beyond replicating our parents' mistakes, as we all used to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that trauma experienced during pregnancy &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2468749924000309" rel="nofollow"&gt;impacts the fetus&lt;/a&gt; in ways that are predictive of everything from poor life outcomes to mental illness. Even more fascinating, the study of epigenetics has shown that trauma changes our very genes such that it can be passed down from generation to generation in our DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found, for example, that &lt;a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(15)00652-6/fulltext" rel="nofollow"&gt;descendants of Holocaust survivors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jpsychopathol.it/article/view/566" rel="nofollow"&gt;Black Americans who were enslaved &lt;/a&gt;show genetic markers of those traumas despite having never experienced those events themselves, or even, in the case of slavery, often being multiple generations removed from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.14118" rel="nofollow"&gt;recently published Canadian study&lt;/a&gt; further showed how trauma goes far beyond just experiencing traumatic events themselves. It followed 501 Canadian families from the time their children were 2 months old until they were 5. All the mothers reported experiencing childhood traumas on the list of so-called "ACEs," or adverse childhood experiences that are predictive of poor life outcomes and mental health struggles. The list includes everything from parents divorcing to physical or sexual abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that maternal childhood trauma was substantially linked to both socioeconomic level and how attuned and responsive mothers were to their kids' needs. The traumatized moms in the study tended to be poorer and less sensitive overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking anecdotally as a child of a mom like this, the latter is often a result of the former. Regardless, poverty is itself on the list of ACEs, and low attunement and sensitivity can be forms of neglect, which is also on the list of ACEs. So it's easy to see why this has such an impact on kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/subtle-signs-woman-who-has-been-through-lot-life-according-research"&gt;11 Subtle Signs Of A Woman Who Has Been Through A Lot In Life, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When it came to the traumatized moms' kids, they showed three main tendencies:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Emotional problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/moms-childhood-trauma-raise-kids-emotional-problems.png" alt="Man who had a mom experience childhood trauma and he now has emotional problems" title="Signs Your Mom Experienced Childhood Trauma" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;cottonbro studio | Pexels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is certainly no surprise. Children of &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/family/kids-thrive-mom-dad-depressed"&gt;parents with anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt; are far more susceptible to having anxiety and depression themselves. And given that financial struggles alone are decisively linked to anxiety and depression, let alone childhood trauma, it's unsurprising that many of the mothers in the study had these conditions, and so did their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another unsurprising but important finding: The moms' rates of depression were also linked to their kids' fathers' histories of what the study called "conduct problems." The fathers' negative behaviors strengthened the link between maternal anxiety and depression and the same conditions in kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-parents-trauma-dumped-affecting-now"&gt;5 Signs Your Parents Trauma Dumped On You As A Kid &amp;amp; It’s Affecting You Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Behavior problems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found a strong link between the mothers' lower sensitivity and kids who were aggressive or rule-breakers, and an even stronger link between these behaviors and relationship conflict in the kids' parents, which itself was in turn strongly linked to maternal trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here again, the fathers had a major impact, though. A &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/signs-raised-emotionally-immature-father"&gt;father's own history of behavior problems&lt;/a&gt; as a kid was linked to their own children's issues. We can infer that this was also linked to the marital discord observed, though the study did not delve into this specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Struggles with academics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final outcome observed was &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/parents-blame-teacher-middle-schooler-failing-math"&gt;cognitive difficulties in kids&lt;/a&gt;, especially when it came to vocabulary and math skills. The scientists found that the moms' levels of sensitivity were the biggest factor, and resulted in low test scores in these skills for their kids. This is, of course, in line with the wealth of data showing childhood adversity has a direct impact on learning and academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study's authors say their findings are in line with what's called the "interactionist model" of child development. It's a sort of trickle-down effect that scientists call a "cascade of risk." Trauma impacts moms' mental health, socioeconomic level, and marital relationships, which impacts their ability to serve their kids' emotional needs, which in turn impacts their children's development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while one of the study's limitations is its lack of in-depth examination of fathers' impacts on all this, it nonetheless gives yet more confirmation that we should view trauma not as discrete events that happened to one person, but events that have wide-ranging impacts. It also lends yet more credence to how important the mental health work that so many younger generations are doing these days. That work doesn't just affect the past and present, but the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/family/impact-your-parents-childhood-trauma-your-marriage"&gt;The Impact Of Your Parents’ Childhood Trauma On Your Marriage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;John Sundholm is a writer, editor, and video personality with 20 years of experience in media and entertainment.

			&lt;p&gt;Slight variations in a person's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse"&gt;pulse rate&lt;/a&gt; could give clues about the likelihood of future cognitive decline, according to a new study, potentially giving us a valuable new test for cognitive problems that would be quick and easy to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that researchers invest a lot of time in, because knowing when cognitive decline &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-4-key-factors-that-may-predict-cognitive-decline"&gt;might start&lt;/a&gt;, and how it may progress, means better support and more clarity for those involved. Along the way, it also reveals new insights into how these conditions develop, and how they might be stopped for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, an international team analyzed pulse rate data across a night of sleep from 503 individuals with an average age of 82. Cognitive tests were also carried out around that same time, as well as in at least one follow-up visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a statistical model called distribution entropy that predicts health outcomes, the researchers found an association between pulse rate complexity – how much the pulse rate varied and adapted throughout the night – and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-trait-in-speech-that-foreshadows-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; in future years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Higher complexity of pulse rate is linked with slower cognitive decline in older adults," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.041448"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. By contrast, reduced complexity was found to be associated with faster cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Future studies should test whether complexity is also associated with future risks of neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia, and further elucidate the causal directions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distribution entropy is a relatively new, alternative method of measuring heart rate and the corresponding pulse rate sent through the body. Researchers have already linked this resting heartbeat complexity to other health risks, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.120.018483"&gt;including cardiorespiratory problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162073" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162073" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WatchPAT300.jpg" alt="Itamar WatchPAT 300 device" class="wp-image-162073 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WatchPAT300.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WatchPAT300-480x415.jpg 480w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/WatchPAT300-600x519.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162073" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The pulse oximeter used in the study. (Itamar Medical Inc)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thinking is that a more adaptable heart is a healthier heart. If the heart is going through a more complex set of changes in response to what's happening in the body, it's operating in a more nimble and agile way, like a runner changing pace and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2019.00710"&gt;previously been suggested&lt;/a&gt; between heart rate variability and cognitive function, but this new type of measurement seems to go deeper, even predicting problems with brain health before noticeable symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Heart rate complexity is a hallmark of healthy physiology," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/pulse-rate-measure-predicts-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical engineer and computational physiologist Peng Li, from Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our hearts must balance between spontaneity and adaptability, incorporating internal needs and external stressors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More conventional measures of heart rate didn't show any relationship to subsequent cognitive decline in this study, the researchers found, suggesting the distribution entropy approach might be more sensitive to health changes in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research can now look at why this relationship exists, and the sort of biological pathways it's operating along. The team also wants to analyze if there's a relationship to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk"&gt;the onset of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, as well as cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The findings underscore the usefulness of our approach as a noninvasive measure for how flexible the heart is in responding to nervous system cues," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/pulse-rate-measure-predicts-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Chenlu Gao, lead author and sleep scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is suitable for future studies aimed at understanding the interplay between heart health and cognitive aging."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.125.041448"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued: “I analysed the variant using population and patient databases, computer prediction tools and the results of functional trials, and came to the conclusion that the variant was probably cancer-causing and that children born from this donor should receive genetic counselling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children who have been shown to have the gene are advised to have whole-body and brain MRI scans. They are also recommended to have breast and abdomen ultrasounds as adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Paulli Budtz, a spokesperson for the European Sperm Bank, told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;: “We are deeply affected by this case.” She said the donor had been thoroughly tested but that “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit, and have advocated for this on several occasions. This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 18:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMS04Ym9BUjJMNDFTcE1NUjFsWGk3UTZBY19HOHZsWEg1eGYyek1JM1lJcnhHaUx4V3JwNTJySXBIbXNNV3hzSXdVUVcwYWR4U1FaaEdmdkFiUzEwYmtXdjk2VVFkcVFrUGE5TW5yZ2RTcW5fblBXcW10ZU1qaWJUVnRaeXcyM2NibWJORVNwdjlLRXM2eGgwd3NhdTQ</guid></item><item><title>Caturday Pootie日记：夏天来了- Daily Kos | Caturday Pootie Diary: Summer is coming - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQbDFaR3JjQWtZMDgtUzU0Y2pxUW1tblRjZy12ekFSWmF1cnZRZExLeFljek9QM0x0QjFpVzRGaVh6Y2t1d0tvRWdsbVJsLU9BMTE4cEJMSC1wVlo3S0JaaTJPT1p5Mlh3d2lSbjdiNWJOdzNucGdwcUNyZlJGZVNrbU9qVW9ueGI0MERZNno5aTFFMUxM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;I shook my head at the cat staring hopefully up at me. “You can’t have any,” I said, taking a bite of my sandwich. “You’re diabetic and your mouth is still healing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Surely I can have one little bite,” he argued. “One little bite won’t hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It might so we aren’t taking the chance,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He sighed, and turned his back on me to lie down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A gentle reminder of how we do things:  &lt;/em&gt;🐱🐶🐦&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="image-captioned align-right"&gt;&lt;img alt="StFrancisandthebird.jpg" src="https://images.dailykos.com/images/914058/large/StFrancisandthebird.jpg?1612489159"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do not troll the diary. If you hate pootie diaries, leave now. No harm, no foul.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please do share pics of your fur kids!  If you have health/behavior issues with your pets, feel free to bring it to the community.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pooties are cats; Woozles are dogs.  Birds... are birds! Peeps are people.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whatever happens in the outer blog STAYS in the outer blog.  If you’re having “issues” with another Kossack, keep it “out there.” This is a place to relax and play; please treat it accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are some pics we never post:  &lt;/strong&gt;snakes, creepy crawlies, &lt;em&gt;any and all photos that depict or encourage human cruelty toward animals.&lt;/em&gt;  These are considered “out of bounds” and will not be tolerated.  If we alert you to it, please remember that we do have phobic peeps who react strongly to them.  If you keep posting banned pics...well then...the Tigress will have to take matters in hand.  Or, paw.I snatched an apple out of the bowl on the kitchen island and dropped it into the lunch bag, then satisfied that I had enough to eat for the day, I zipped it closed. The microwave signaled that the egg was done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;




          &lt;p class="story-intro-divider"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          
&lt;p&gt;He stood and stretched (“Oooh, goooooooood streeeeeeeetch!”) then turned toward me and placed a paw on my lap. “I could lie on the furry blanket?” he said, hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s so hot,” I whined. “I’m sorry, I can’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You aren’t fun anymore,” he huffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Spring is not my fault.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m getting fewer treats — “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re crunchy and your mouth is still healing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s no kibble — “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can only have soft food for just a few more days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You keep shooting that terrible stuff down my throat!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I winced at that. The day after his procedure, his cheeks had swelled up a bit and the vet gave us some antibiotics for him just to prevent any infection that might be brewing from taking hold. The liquid was thick, and brown, and decidedly sludge-like. “I’m sorry about that. Only a few more days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You keep taking me to the vet! You left me there &lt;em&gt;all day&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That was to help you!” I defended myself. “And as long as your healing keeps going well you won’t have to go back for a while.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You should be nicer to me,” he said, darkly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My credit card is being very nice to you,” I shot back, then immediately regretted it. That wasn’t his fault. “I don’t mean that,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t even know what that means,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sighed, and petted him in attempt to defuse the situation. “It’s been a rough few weeks,” I commiserated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It really has,” he agreed, settling down again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry. This will be a good summer. Your mouth is going to feel so much better. No more pain!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That will be pretty good,” he grudgingly agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I frowned down at him. “I wish you would tell me when you were hurting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I can’t do that!” he said, scandalized. “What about the predators!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I smiled. “You’re an indoor cat,” I reminded him.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What do you want to do this summer?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sleep,” he said, immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Of course,” I said. “That’s the best way to beat the heat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I like to eat, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are all things you do all the time,” I pointed out. “Is there anything you want to do just for summer?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He thought about it. “Keep to myself and not be near any humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laughed. “Yeah, that is your favorite summer activity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Are you going to spend time in the weird big water dish?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I nodded. “Probably a lot of time,” I said. “You could go swimming with me. I bet you can do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recoiled a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Or not!” I said, quickly. “I’d never force you!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Human, the ducks go in there,” he said with exaggerated patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Yes, but I’m not afraid of them. And they don’t go in the backyard when I’m out there. I scare them away.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat in silence for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They poop in there,” he said, quietly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my turn to recoil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was partially asleep when I felt Freddie get up. He wasn’t trying to hard to keep me from waking up, walking over my lap without grace or gentleness. “Ouch,” I murmured, opening my eyes. “Where are you going?” I asked as he jumped to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to get a head start on Summer,” he said, over his shoulder as he left the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to ignore me?” I said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s time to ignore you,” he confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Caturday, Peeps! On Sunday night Freddie had some swelling in his cheeks and I called the vet (they are a 24/7 eVet as well as a regular clinic so someone is always there). I really thought it was a normal reaction but I just wanted to make sure. They told me it was not, in fact, a normal reaction and that I should bring him in. Since he was eating and not having trouble breathing, they made me an appointment with his regular vet for the next morning instead of recommending I bring him in that night. The swelling was better in the morning, but I still kept the appointment. His lungs were clear and he didn’t seem to be in any extra pain, so the vet just gave us some antibiotics to take home and instructed me to come back if the problem didn’t improve or got worse. He said that diabetes can sometimes complicate healing. By the next day, the swelling was gone altogether so I don’t think we’ll have to go back. He does seem to be doing pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

Medical Center's infectious diseases division's pediatric department, said: “The fact that we're still seeing deaths just means it's still circulating, and people are still catching it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts indicated that poor vaccination rates, declining immunity, and a lack of treatment availability are some of the reasons why individuals may still be dying from the illness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the data, just 13% of kids received the upgraded COVID vaccine within the same time period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weekly COVID deaths are likely a result of insufficient vaccination uptake, according to Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine specialist and president and co-director of the Atria Research Institute, reported ABC News.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some recipients of the vaccine, however, might not be exhibiting a healthy immunological response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poland noted that the chance of contracting COVID-19 increases when immunity to the vaccine diminishes over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this reason, it is currently advised that people 65 and older have two doses of the upgraded COVID vaccination in the gap of six months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 death rate in the US is now highest among people 75 and older, with 4.66 fatalities per 100,000, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Savvy Senior,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I take Advil pretty regularly for arthritis pain and headaches, but how can I tell if I’m taking more than is safe?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Achy Alan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Alan,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen – better known by one of its brand names, Advil – is one of the most popular medications on the market today for treating all different types of pain, headaches, fevers and cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the drug’s broad pain-reducing effects, safety record and availability over the counter (OTC), it’s no surprise that some people pop the little brownish-red tablets whenever they feel the slightest twinge of discomfort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But ibuprofen, which is also sold under brand names like Motrin and Nuprin, can pose certain health risks, especially for those with kidney or stomach issues. Here’s what you should know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What’s Safe?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most adults and children ages 12 years and older, the recommended OTC dose of ibuprofen is one (or two, if needed) 200-milligram tablets, caplets or gel caplets every four to six hours while symptoms persist. You shouldn’t take more than 1,200 mg (or six pills) in a 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you haven’t consulted a doctor about how much is safe, or if you aren’t certain about your risk factors, it’s best not to exceed the recommended limit of 1,200 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have chronic pain, or were recently injured or had surgery, your doctor may prescribe ibuprofen for you at a higher dose. Prescription tablets are usually stronger compared to the OTC dose, such as 600 mg and 800 mg. The maximum daily dose for prescription-strength ibuprofen is 3,200 mg in a 24-hour period. But it’s important only to take what your provider has prescribed for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also be aware that ibuprofen is sometimes added to certain cold and flu medications, so always read the ingredient list on medications before using them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Be Cautious!&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ibuprofen belongs to a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which reduce pain and inflammation by blocking the activity of certain enzymes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these enzymes also help maintain kidney and liver function and regulate the balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body. So, taking ibuprofen can be dangerous for patients with kidney disease or failure; those with liver damage or cirrhosis; and people with conditions that put strain on their kidneys, like high blood pressure or heart failure. Those at high risk for these conditions – as well as for stomach ulcers, heart attacks, strokes or bleeding problems – should talk with their doctors before taking ibuprofen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who take medications such as diuretics, anticoagulants, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) to manage cardiovascular issues should also be careful, because ibuprofen stresses the kidneys and the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reduce these health risks, don’t take the maximum recommended dose for more than a week or two at a time. If you are needing it for more than two weeks, or if you’re turning to ibuprofen every day to keep your aches and pains in check, you need to see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When taken for long periods, ibuprofen can also increase the risk of stomach ulcers. The drug inhibits enzymes that, among other things, aid in the production of mucus that lines and protects the stomach lining, so without these enzymes, the stomach becomes vulnerable to irritation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some alternatives to ibuprofen you should talk to your doctor about include acetaminophen (Tylenol), topical NSAIDs (diclofenac gel) that is not absorbed into the blood to the same extent as oral NSAIDs, nonacetylated salicylates, curcumin (an active ingredient in turmeric) and acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Send your questions or comments to questions@savvysenior.org, or to Savvy Senior, P.O.

Researchers observed that healthy spouses of partners with insomnia, depression, and anxiety developed similar mental health symptoms and microbiota profiles within six months of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found strong correlations between shared bacterial strains, altered cortisol levels, and increased depression and anxiety scores. While the findings are not yet causal, they highlight a possible microbial route for emotional contagion between intimate partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Convergence:&lt;/strong&gt; Spouses’ oral microbiomes became more similar over time, particularly when one partner had depression and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes in microbiota composition correlated with increased salivary cortisol and worsening mental health in the healthy partner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Bacteria Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher levels of Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae were linked to the depression-anxiety phenotype.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral microbiota dysbiosis and altered salivary cortisol levels have been linked to depression and anxiety. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that bacterial transmission can occur between spouses, this study aimed to investigate whether the transmission of oral microbiota between newlywed couples mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validated Persian versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory were administered to 1,740 couples who had been married for six months. The researchers compared 268 healthy control spouses with 268 affected cases in a cross-sectional study. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months, healthy spouses married to an insomniac with the depression-anxiety (DA) phenotype scored significantly higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and Beck Anxiety Inventory compared to their baseline scores. This indicates that their sleep quality, depression, and anxiety scores became more similar to those of their affected spouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the composition of their oral microbiota changed significantly, becoming increasingly similar to that of their spouses. Specifically, in couples where one partner had the DA phenotype, the oral microbiota of the healthy spouse mirrored that of the affected partner (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These microbial changes correlated with alterations in salivary cortisol levels as well as depression and anxiety scores. Linear discriminant analysis revealed that the relative abundances of &lt;em&gt;Clostridia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Veillonella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lachnospiraceae&lt;/em&gt; were significantly higher in insomniacs with the DA phenotype compared to healthy controls (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transmission of oral microbiota plays a partial role in mediating depression and anxiety among couples. Since this study is associational, further research is needed to establish whether this association is causal. If it is determined that this association is indeed causal, it could have significant implications for contemporary research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that, within the framework of diagnostic, predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine, the practical and theoretical implications of this study may enhance our understanding of various aspects of microbiota-host interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#097a6c7b7f606a6c49716068616c797c6b65607a6160676e276a6664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shelly Zhang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://xiahepublishing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Shelly Zhang – Xia &amp;amp; He Publishing Inc&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.14218/ERHM.2025.00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oral Microbiota Transmission Partially Mediates Depression and Anxiety in Newlywed Couples&lt;/a&gt;” by Neil Daghnall et al. &lt;em&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p id="p21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9XaThDUEtuZGVHVlQ4M2JyWG1Ba0dFRk41bnlhN3lpbVVEZjVldWFHZFlXNWM4RG0yM2dvbUtWQnFKdWVfOHJiRC0tTFVJTklRRHVDbHpKR2VZZGNrV19MLUlQME1fU0Jwd0N6bHpPeFRVUnVkd1VNVk4xQQ</guid></item><item><title>抗抑郁药可能有助于免疫系统对抗癌症- Earth.com | Antidepressants may help the immune system fight cancer - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPaktyeHRfUGxiS1ZvN2o1a0R5UkVXdHJBUWwtVmM1ckQ3TWNVUXVYM21RRzZVZWpzbFBtLWVJV0dkTFROMVRRc3VYNnpHaVdHQ3JCMUFadHZpRDRJaTM4eXVOQTlOaFRoZGxVMEZHcjVFcGR4QUNEb3lFMV80Y0hnR1dfZGlvbnYxM2x3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants are commonly associated with improving mood and mental health. But recent research suggests they may also have an unexpected effect: helping the immune system fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the &lt;a href="https://www.ucla.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of California, Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; (UCLA) found that a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) significantly boost the cancer-fighting abilities of T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both mouse and human tumor models, SSRIs were shown to suppress tumor growth across multiple &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/obesity-is-linked-to-32-cancer-types-that-could-drive-40-of-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-serotonin-s-cancer-fighting-role"&gt;Serotonin’s cancer-fighting role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It turns out SSRIs don’t just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier – even while they’re fighting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-research-ai-will-change-the-way-we-see-tumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tumors&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Lili Yang, UCLA professor of Microbiology, Immunology &amp;amp; Molecular Genetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These drugs have been widely and safely used to treat depression for decades, so repurposing them for cancer would be a lot easier than developing an entirely new therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs, which include well-known medications like Prozac and Celexa, work by blocking a protein called serotonin transporter (SERT). This action increases levels of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-dance-of-dopamine-and-serotonin-influences-social-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt;, often called the “happiness hormone,” in the brain. However, serotonin also plays a vital role in other bodily functions, including digestion, metabolism, and immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team began exploring serotonin’s connection to cancer after noticing that immune cells from tumors had more serotonin-regulating molecules than expected. Their attention turned to an enzyme called MAO-A, which breaks down serotonin and other neurotransmitters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-depression-drugs-to-tumor-fighters"&gt;Depression drugs to tumor fighters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2021, the team discovered that when T cells detect tumors, they produce MAO-A, which limits their effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models with melanoma and colon cancer, treating with MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) – another class of antidepressants – improved the T cells’ cancer-fighting abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But MAOIs come with risks. They can cause severe side effects and interact dangerously with certain foods and medications. That concern led the team to explore SERT, a molecule with a simpler role – transporting serotonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike MAO-A, which breaks down multiple neurotransmitters, SERT has one job – to transport serotonin,” explained Dr. Bo Li, assistant researcher at UCLA. “SERT made for an especially attractive target because the drugs that act on it – SSRIs – are widely used with minimal side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-antidepressants-tested-on-cancer"&gt;Antidepressants tested on cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the theory, the researchers used SSRIs in models of melanoma, breast, prostate, colon, and bladder cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were promising. Tumors shrank by more than 50% on average. At the same time, T cells became more efficient at killing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-each-day-at-any-speed-lowers-the-risk-of-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SSRIs made the killer T cells happier in the otherwise oppressive tumor environment by increasing their access to serotonin signals, reinvigorating them to fight and kill cancer cells,” Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-drugs-aid-immunotherapy"&gt;Mood drugs aid immunotherapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t stop there. The researchers also wanted to see if SSRIs could improve the effects of existing cancer treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts combined an SSRI with an immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy -specifically, an anti-PD-1 antibody. ICB therapies remove the brakes from immune cells, helping them target tumors more aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination had dramatic results. Tumor size was significantly reduced in all test cases, and some mice went into complete remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/reprogramming-the-immune-system-to-attack-cancer-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Immune&lt;/a&gt; checkpoint blockades are effective in fewer than 25% of patients,” said James Elsten-Brown, a researcher and PhD student at UCLA. “If a safe, widely available drug like an SSRI could make these therapies more effective, it would be hugely impactful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-antidepressant-side-benefit"&gt;Rethinking antidepressant side benefit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers now plan to study cancer patients who are already taking SSRIs, especially those undergoing ICB therapy. The goal is to determine whether these patients show improved outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since around 20% of cancer patients take antidepressants – most commonly SSRIs – we see a unique opportunity to explore how these drugs might improve cancer outcomes,” Yang said. “Our goal is to design a clinical trial to compare treatment outcomes between cancer patients who take these medications and those who do not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could also lower the cost and speed up the development of cancer treatments. Because SSRIs are already FDA-approved, they don’t need the same rigorous testing as new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies estimate the bench-to-bedside pipeline for new cancer therapies costs an average of $1.5 billion,” Yang added. “When you compare this to the estimated $300 million cost to repurpose FDA-approved drugs, it’s clear why this approach has so much potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00502-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:40:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPaktyeHRfUGxiS1ZvN2o1a0R5UkVXdHJBUWwtVmM1ckQ3TWNVUXVYM21RRzZVZWpzbFBtLWVJV0dkTFROMVRRc3VYNnpHaVdHQ3JCMUFadHZpRDRJaTM4eXVOQTlOaFRoZGxVMEZHcjVFcGR4QUNEb3lFMV80Y0hnR1dfZGlvbnYxM2x3</guid></item><item><title>这是您不想忘记清洗的身体部位： “总是捕捉污垢” -《纽约邮报》 | This is the one body part you don’t want to forget to wash: ‘Always traps grime’ - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPSllFZTJiRC1aVmRrVjl1NzM1eWxkQVFhQ3dyblg5ZlZ3SUFMSlRLQXBuWmwxQUJPQ1hISmoxYnY4d3hyRU9ybFU2YmV4LUZjZWJoRVBYVDhaSGY0U2dRampKdkM3OHIwS3g4VEZ6ZHJEUUdESXE1bThJQ2dPVmVnMy05NjlBZ3AybUp3NnQyUXlhOUZBNEo1YXFQMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;You might be rinsing and repeating — but you’re probably not as clean as you think.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dermatologists say there’s one spot most people overlook in their shower routine where dirt, oil and dead skin cells can accumulate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Left unchecked, that buildup can lead to bacterial infections, painful skin problems and a foul odor that lingers long after you’ve toweled off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Studies show roughly two-thirds of Americans shower daily.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daria – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctors &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/how-to-clean-your-ear"&gt;generally agree&lt;/a&gt; that your ears do a good job of cleaning themselves, so you can probably toss the Q-tips. But the area around them is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I always recommend people wash the skin behind their ears intentionally and specifically to get into the creases of where the ear meets your skin, as it can always trap grime,” &lt;a href="https://www.beloithealthsystem.org/find-a-provider/roger-kapoor-m-d-m-b-a-f-a-a-d-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Roger Kapoor&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and senior vice president at Beloit Memorial Hospital, &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/most-people-forget-to-wash-this-body-part" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told Parade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;That’s especially true in summer, when sweat and sunscreen create a moist breeding ground for bacteria and fungus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For people who wear glasses, the arms resting behind the ears can also easily transfer bacteria to the skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ear-itation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oil, dirt, and dead skin cells piling up behind your ears can clog pores and cause painful pimples and acne.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It can also irritate your skin — and even trigger &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/what-to-know-about-ear-eczema" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ear eczema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ear eczema symptoms range from hardly noticeable to extremely uncomfortable.

 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;artem_goncharov – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This inflammatory skin condition causes red, itchy patches that can be dry, flaky or waxy, depending on the type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Any inflammatory condition of the skin can lead to cracks in the natural skin barrier, allowing bacteria in and causing infections,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://stcharlesdermatologicsurgery.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stacey Tull&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and micrographic dermatologic surgeon, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-wash-dirtiest-body-parts-in-shower-study-8384889"&gt;told Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even tiny cuts, piercings or scratches inside the ear can open the door to infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In rare but serious cases, those infections can spread beyond the ear and into the bloodstream — potentially leading to life-threatening sepsis, when the body starts attacking its own organs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s that smell?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infections behind the ears can also give off a foul, cheeselike stench, often thanks to bacteria, yeast and fungi, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smell-behind-ears#causes"&gt;according to Healthline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Possible causes of a smell behind the ear include poor hygiene and infections.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Krakenimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sweat gland behind the ears also secrete perspiration starts to stink once it mixes with bacteria and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add sebaceous glands, which secrete a waxy mix of oils and fats, and you’ve got a recipe for some serious funk if it builds up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem can be even worse for people with overactive glands that release extra sweat and oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Wash up — and when to get help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an infection is painful, you have a fever, swollen lymph nodes or home treatments like over-the-counter antifungal creams don’t work, it’s probably time to see a doctor, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325081#prevention" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some infections need stronger antibiotics to clear up and prevent serious complications. Doctors can also prescribe anti-inflammatory ointments to soothe eczema symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors can help diagnose pain behind the ear and recommend various treatments.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;bnenin – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the area behind your ears is simple to clean. All you need is gentle soap and warm water.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trickiest part is probably remembering to scrub the area after hitting all the usual spots in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kapoor says shampoo can help break down oil and bacteria behind your ears, but it rinses off quickly unless you specifically scrub the area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you wear glasses, he also recommends cleaning the arms regularly to keep bacteria from transferring to your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

Mariya Borisova/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study suggests that vitamin D supplementation may help preserve the lengths of the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes known as telomeres.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers say maintaining the length of telomeres may help slow some aspects of biological aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telomere length is an important component of healthy aging, but the role vitamin D can play isn’t yet certain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study reports that vitamin D supplementation may help slow some of the mechanisms of biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shortening is a natural part of aging, but it has been linked to certain age-related diseases. Among those diseases are cancer of the bladder, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said &lt;a href="https://www.augusta.edu/institutes/gpi/gpi-faculty/zhu.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Haidong Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, the first author of the study and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University, in a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/vitamin-d-supplements-show-signs-of-protection-against-biological-aging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts agree the new research is interesting, but they note it has its limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Telomere length was protected with vitamin D supplementation, but it’s not clear how that translates to real life biological aging,” &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/marilyn-tan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Marilyn Tan&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a clinical associate professor of medicine at Stanford University in California, told Healthline. Tan wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present study involved only a relatively small number of people, looked only at telomeres in white blood cells, and did not look extensively at the health impact of these telomere changes,” added &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. “So, the clinical implications one can derive from this study are quite limited.” Cutler was likewise not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers based their findings on the results of the &lt;a href="https://www.vitalstudy.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;VITAL&lt;/a&gt; randomized controlled clinical trial, which was overseen by Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers tracked 1,054 participants to see if vitamin D and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-are-omega-3-fatty-acids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; can lessen telomere shortening and slow biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study group included females ages 55 and older and males ages 50 and older. The researchers followed the participants for five years, measuring telomere length in white blood cells at baseline, year two, and year four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reported that omega-3 fatty acids had no significant effect on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they said vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening and prevented the equivalent of nearly three years of aging in people who took vitamin D in comparison to people who were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say such a slowdown in the aging process has important benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Slowing biological aging may improve life expectancy and quality of life, and it could reduce the risk of various disease states,” Tan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health benefits of vitamin D have been touted over recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/vitamin-d-recommendations-insufficient-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has also indicated that a sufficient amount of vitamin D may help improve heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;35% of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; in the United States have a deficiency of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;current recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; for daily vitamin D consumption is 400 to 800 international units for most healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-dosage#deficiency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is known as the “sunshine vitamin” because the best source for it is sunlight. Your body makes dietary vitamin D3 out of the cholesterol in the skin when it is exposed to the sun’s UV rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-from-sun#time-of-day" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;best time&lt;/a&gt; to get the most of this beneficial sunlight is noon, when the sun is at its peak. However, experts say that too much sunlight can cause sunburns, eye damage, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heat-stroke" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;heatstroke&lt;/a&gt;, and skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren’t a lot of foods that are sufficient sources of vitamin D, but there are a few. They are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can drink &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-milk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;milk&lt;/a&gt; fortified with vitamin D. Some types of mushrooms as well as &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthiest-cheese" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; can also be healthy &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-foods-for-vegetarians#certain-mushrooms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; for vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tan said the amount of vitamin D a person needs depends on the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ideal amount of supplementation depends on one’s baseline vitamin D level,” she explained. “Various factors can impact vitamin D levels and metabolism, including sun exposure, time of year, geographical location, skin tone, kidney function, among other factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While sun exposure can increase vitamin D levels, excessive UV exposure has other health risks,” Tan noted. “Vitamin D can be obtained to a certain degree from the diet, but people often need additional supplemental vitamins. To know exactly how much vitamin D supplementation one needs, you should discuss with your healthcare provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler said people with healthy vitamin D levels probably don’t need supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been many studies involving tens of thousands of people seeking to document [the] benefits of vitamin D in healthy adults with normal vitamin D levels, and no benefits have been found,” Cutler told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has been no documentation of reduced cancer rates, less &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, increased longevity, protection from infection, or improved outcomes from &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-coronavirus" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best-supported strategies to preserve telomere length are &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/benefits-of-aerobic-exercise" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, diet, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/stress-coping-eliminate" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and avoiding harmful substances like &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/smoking/effects-on-body" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/effects-on-body" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;,” he added. “These lifestyle changes don’t just preserve telomeres — they also broadly support healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Healthline</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 14:23:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOOVktSjE5ZWN5VHRSRkdGYjl2c196ZG1pNWpWclBfcTJNbzF6VUZuc0xRNS1nbmpLT0hLMjl1NVB5bjhJWDRGamoxV2d4NW9meUd3UWRadnFOV3lfNjFFSW05YzU5V1BWTi1zOGdBRlhIdEtER2NpbXpydjBpWmFZSHNyY18weWZfMnVFT2pscw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，超过十分之一的老年兽医使用大麻-《华盛顿邮报》 | More than 1 in 10 older vets uses cannabis, study finds - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQSFU4dEhaVmN3amQ0QXJDOWlBeUtQU1lfWXZBeTdseWJxU1hfYVhSNE9WRHZ3TXp1blo1OHpKbWFlYVNqWGsyZGh6cXAwZEVFYlBmVnBvN25QZmtxQVFnSVdEeTlSS0ptQ25zbE5SN09nLTNGanQ0aUtkSXZwdWVWSWFqbmN1ajJZOXJBbA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DLXIEOHSZG5JGHJTEXTA3WMYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More than 1 in 10 veterans ages 65 to 84 used cannabis in the previous month, a new &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.10173" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data published in JAMA Network Open suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3RMBDDVIMRGDNCZGUWYCYOV63A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To learn more about cannabis use in older adults, researchers turned to the Veterans Affairs Cannabis and Aging Study, which follows a national cohort of veterans and their cannabis use.

However, its effects typically last only a week, and frequent dosing poses risks like dissociation or addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study demonstrates that ketamine’s benefits can be extended up to two months by using a compound that enhances ERK signaling, a pathway essential to ketamine’s long-term action. This breakthrough offers a proof of principle for safer, more sustained depression treatment strategies targeting intracellular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid-Acting Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Ketamine alleviates depression symptoms within hours, even in resistant patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended Efficacy:&lt;/strong&gt; A compound called BCI prolonged ketamine’s antidepressant effect up to two months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanism-Based Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Enhancing ERK signaling may help sustain antidepressant effects from a single dose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roughly 10 percent of the U.S. population is afflicted with major depressive disorder at any given time, and up to 20 percent will exhibit MDD symptoms over their lifetimes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite its prevalence, methods to treat MDD often fall short for a not-insignificant portion of the population. Antidepressants—the standard of treatment—don’t work for 30 percent with MDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When infused at a low dose ketamine shows remarkable efficacy as a rapidly acting antidepressant, with effects observed within hours even in patients who have been resistant to other antidepressant treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110354"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ketamine-antidepressant-effect-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, consistent infusions of ketamine are needed to maintain symptoms at bay, which could result in side effects, such as dissociative behaviors and the possibility of addiction, and stopping treatment can result in relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, Lisa Monteggia’s and Ege Kavalali’s labs show that it is feasible to substantially extend the efficacy of a single dose of ketamine from its current duration of up to a week to a longer period of up to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The premise of this study, which was led by Zhenzhong Ma, a fantastic research assistant professor, was based on a testable mechanistic model that we developed that accounts for ketamine’s rapid antidepressant action,” Monteggia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monteggia holds the Lee E. Limbird Chair in Pharmacology and is the Barlow Family Director of the Vanderbilt Brain Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, researchers in the field had determined that ketamine’s antidepressant effect requires the activation of a key signaling pathway called ERK, but only ketamine’s long-term effects—not its rapid effects—are abolished when ERK is inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fast-acting antidepressant, ketamine relies on ERK-dependent synaptic plasticity to produce its rapid behavioral effects. Ma and colleagues hypothesized that they could maintain ketamine’s effects for longer periods by enhancing ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent paper, Ma discovered that ketamine’s antidepressant effects could be sustained for up to two months by using a drug called BCI, which inhibits a protein phosphatase and results in increased ERK activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By inhibiting the phosphatase, the authors retained ERK’s activity and augmented the synaptic plasticity that drives ketamine’s prolonged antidepressant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the use of BCI make the application of these results to the clinic difficult, Monteggia said that the results provide a proof of principle that ketamine’s antidepressant action can be sustained by targeting intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Kavalali, the William Stokes Professor of Experimental Therapeutics and the chair of the Department of Pharmacology, have worked on the project since its inception and hope that it fosters other studies looking to identify specific molecules that will enhance and sustain the action of a single dose of ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this work will be a steppingstone toward improving MDD patients’ lives by reducing the burden of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afc2ceddc6dcdcce81dcc7cedfc6ddc0efd9cec1cbcaddcdc6c3db81cacbda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marissa Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vanderbilt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marissa Shapiro – Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abb6748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/a&gt;” by Lisa Monteggia et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced ERK activity extends ketamine’s antidepressant effects by augmenting synaptic plasticity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated ketamine treatment to maintain a rapid antidepressant effect can lead to side effects over time, highlighting an unmet clinical need for sustaining this drug’s antidepressant action from a single administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ketamine-induced synaptic potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses has been proposed to be a key synaptic substrate for antidepressant action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we found that ketamine-induced CA3-CA1 synaptic potentiation could be augmented by transiently increasing extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) activity through pharmacological inhibition of dual-specificity phosphatases 6 (DUSP6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant-like behavioral effects of acute ketamine treatment were extended by DUSP6 inhibition for up to 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selective deletion of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) in excitatory neurons abolished these DUSP6 inhibition–mediated synaptic and behavioral effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data suggest that ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects can be sustained by selectively targeting downstream intracellular signaling.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2025 13:35:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE93LWRCTXJvZnQzbUJTcjltTEFreVBEVXM5emdPVVZNUmlfWUUzMGVmRXVXcjMyLVdjcVFyaDlJdGNTRkN5WVlwNjNsRkxhN3oyX1p2WXp3MklQYmZ0cnd6WXlfQjdiQ2RsWFEzT0IwYUk</guid></item></channel></rss>
