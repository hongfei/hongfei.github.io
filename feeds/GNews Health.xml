Which is to say: It’s still pretty far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That’s not for lack of trying. Some researchers are attempting to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00183-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;reprogram cells&lt;/a&gt; to make them biologically younger, which has been shown to reverse features of aging in older animals. Unfortunately, this can also induce cancer. Other researchers are studying drugs called &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047637423001148" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;senolytics&lt;/a&gt;, which aim to clear aging cells out of the body. However, they can also destroy other cells humans need to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Transfusions of blood from young mice appear to rejuvenate older mice, but companies offering this unproven treatment for humans are charging a lot for a potentially dangerous therapy. And while some longevity enthusiasts are &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/well/live/rapamycin-aging-longevity-benefits-risks.html" title=""&gt;taking the drug rapamycin&lt;/a&gt; because studies have shown it helps animals live longer, it also weakens the immune system and hasn’t been proved to work in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;I find these efforts intriguing and worth pursuing. But most people don’t simply want to live until 110. They want to extend the amount of time they live free of serious disease, a concept known as health span. That’s why the most sensible approach is to reduce the toll of three major age-related diseases: cancer, heart disease and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. It may be less flashy, but it’s more attainable than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s estimated that at least 80 percent of cardiovascular disease cases, 40 percent of cancer cases and 45 percent of Alzheimer’s cases are preventable. Even with a long lag — these diseases can each take 20 years or more to develop — researchers have struggled to accurately define a person’s risk early enough to intervene effectively. Sure, someone can take a genetic test and learn he’s at a heightened risk for Alzheimer’s disease, but what good is that if he doesn’t know whether the disease will emerge early, when he’s 95 or not at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the near future, doctors may not only be able to identify whether a person is at high risk for a serious, age-related disease, they may also be able to predict when that disease is most likely to manifest and how quickly it could progress. Several recent discoveries from the science of aging are making this increasingly possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

'But for the first time, I’m kind of stepping outside of my comfort zone and letting go of my past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So it is a really big deal for me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decision follows a years-long, harrowing ordeal that saw Maya lose not only her mother but, for a time, her freedom – all while suffering from a rare condition that debilitates her to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the eloquent and soft-spoken teenager is taking more control over her life – and her healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;An agonizing condition that baffled doctors  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At nine years old, Maya started suffering mystery symptoms such as lesions, asthma attacks and lower-limb muscle contractions. She was in constant pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specialist Dr. Anthony Kirkpatrick diagnosed the young girl in 2015 with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), an extremely rare neurological condition that causes acute sensitivity to even the slightest touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kirkpatrick recommended ketamine infusion treatments for the pain - they noticeably helped. He also suggested a more intense procedure involving an induced coma that - after days of research - the family decided to travel to Mexico to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She showed signs of improvement, but severe abdominal pain in 2016 sent Maya to the ER at Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital (JHACH) in St. Petersburg, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Beata requested ketamine as treatment for Maya, doctors refused to administer the drug. And when she further explained that it was recommended by a doctor and the only remedy they'd found, then demanded it for her daughter, Maya was taken from her parents' custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata was then accused of having &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9834-factitious-disorder-imposed-on-another-fdia"&gt;Munchausen syndrome by proxy&lt;/a&gt; (MSbP) - a mental health condition where the affected falsely acts like someone within their care is sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya is leaving behind her home state altogether, along with the painful memories it holds of her mother’s death and her own medical kidnapping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya was just 10 years old when she went to hospital with a debilitating pain. Doctors accused her mother of abuse and Maya didn't see her for 87 days &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The story of Maya's medical kidnapping and the agonizing journey that drove her mother Beata (second from right) to death is the focus of the harrowing Netflix documentary 'Take Care of Maya'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent a court-ordered psychological evaluation which determined she did not have MSbP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Maya remained in the custody of the state and, for months, was allowed only minimal contact with her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While confined to her hospital bed in December 2016, Maya wrote a letter to the judge overseeing her case, outlining in excruciating detail how she was in more pain and begging him to let her see her family over Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya's lawyer also asked the court if there was 'any way' she could simply see her mother to give her a hug, but the judge refused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She only saw her mother once over the 87 days – when Maya appeared in court in January 2017 for a dependency hearing, where a judge would consider if she could return to her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya was in a wheelchair, and her family and legal team said she was looking 'worse' than ever, despite almost three months in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata died by suicide 48 hours later, believing that removing herself as a perceived obstacle was the only way to get her daughter better care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family sued JHACH, accusing the hospital of medical malpractice, false imprisonment and intentional infliction of emotional distress among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were stunned when they found staff had billed their insurance for 174 CRPS treatments - a remedy for the condition they’d accused her mother of manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five months after Take Care of Maya’s streaming premiere, a Florida jury found the hospital had falsely imprisoned Maya and contributed to her mother's death - the Kowalskis were awarded $261 million in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amount was later reduced to $213.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A judge struck down the hospital’s demand for a retrial. JHACH is appealing the decision, insisting they were not responsible for Beata's death because she wasn't in their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya started learning the piano at three years old with her mother's support. A natural performer, she is now hoping to put her ordeal behind her by moving to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Trying to put her traumatic childhood behind her  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya tries not to dwell on the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We have a limited time on this Earth,' she says profoundly, 'and why would I want to spend even a fraction of that thinking about the worst things that have happened to me?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, she looks to the future, focuses on spirituality and meditates overlooking the lake and private dock behind the Florida home she has been sharing with her father and younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to concentrating on mental health, Maya does physical therapy exercises in her family’s pool. But her pain has still not completely gone away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have my moments where it is worse, and I always get really scared,' she tells the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My biggest fear is being as sick as I used to be, but I am starting to do the things I know work for my pain management and promising myself that I’m going to take care of my physical being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I feel like the work has paid off. I’m walking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, she has limitations. She tried figure skating again – something she’d enjoyed doing with her mother – but ‘noticed the pain was getting a little bit uncontrollable’ and stopped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nowadays, Maya says, she’ll feel pain in her leg and lower back and ‘randomly’ in her left wrist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few months before her 19th birthday, she moved with her father and brother to Odessa, 95 miles north of the home she grew up in, to mark a new beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya still has ‘beautiful memories’ from her old house, but couldn’t escape the fact that it was where her mother died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s like every day I was reminded that she had killed herself,’ she says. ‘It was time for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Also, people in the community started to notice us for our traumatic history,' she recalled, adding that she has 'a hard time' when people she doesn't know have preconceived notions about her based off 'the worst part of my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In addition to concentrating on mental health, Maya does physical therapy exercises in her family’s pool. But her pain has still not completely gone away&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Healing through pursuing her passion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Immediately after the move farther north, Maya didn’t know what to do with herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’d earlier been accepted into the University of Miami and planned to study business marketing, but also considered becoming a homicide detective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, she decided to forego the classroom completely for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think I would be a lot more stable just starting my life as an adult, as opposed to going to school and then worrying about what people think of me,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From an emotional maturity standpoint, I definitely am a few years above average – which I see as a gift now, but it has been hard to cope with,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘I feel like an alien most of the time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’s also emerging from what she calls ‘one consistent' eight-year-long depressive episode where the trauma kept piling up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was ‘during a depressive episode’ after moving to Odessa that Maya leaned into a talent and passion that’s now sending her life in a new direction: the performing arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I looked up things in the [Odessa] area, and I found an acting studio,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘It was the first time I had genuinely laughed and smiled in a long time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A natural performer, she wanted to be a pop singer as a child and, with her mother's support, started learning piano at three years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I remember going to her about it, and she took it upon herself to educate herself on the very basics before putting me in class,’ says Maya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beata would listen to her daughter play while working and ‘found it very relaxing,’ Maya says. There’s a Yamaha baby grand in the pristine white living room of their new home that she likes to play at sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She’d been taking vocal coaching twice a week up until recently but hasn’t performed much publicly since her mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I sing, I think of her… it’s very emotional for me,’ she says. ‘I always end up crying.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has focused on acting - something she used to love doing in school productions until she got sick - and found it a very effective outlet for channeling her pain and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve only been acting for four months, and… I have so much room to grow,’ she says. ‘I don’t think I’m that great; I feel that I’m decent… but I know one of the silver linings of everything I’ve been through is that it has added so much life experience – and that life experience, I think, is more beneficial than talent, or what other people call talent, because it’s real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When you’re able to excavate those emotions and apply them to these projects, it’s actually very healing, as well,' she said, adding that it's allowed her to let go of some anger, sadness and hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She considers this catharsis a 'privilege.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I’m able to have this outlet to kind of project all of it in a healthy way... I’ve gotten to this place where I feel very grounded. I feel very calm,’ Maya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Obviously, I still struggle with sadness and anger and frustration, but the difference is, I have a coping mechanism – and for all people, at the end of the day, you have to learn how to forgive.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya can now frequently be found filming audition tapes or flying to jobs. Despite her newbie status, she’s already worked on projects that include a YouTube comedy series, a Hallmark movie and a dystopian short film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One day, I want to be in a feature film,' she says. 'And I just want to feel that I'm making movies that matter.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some collaborators know her history, such as the director who cast her as 'girl who’d lost her mother'. Others have no idea. And when it comes to genre, Maya says she does ‘gravitate towards drama, horror and dark comedy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The acting community has also introduced her to a new circle of ‘soul friends’ she would never have expected getting close to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I actually feel like they are my best friends,’ she says. ‘It’s hard to find people here (in Florida) that I could connect with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Beata took her own life in the garage of the family home in Florida after only seeing Maya once in 87 days  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And these people have gone through a range of things as well. So I think, the collective of their experiences and mine - we just have a different type of bond.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;The unbreakable bond with her father and brother  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her strongest bond, though, seems to still be with her brother, Kyle, who’s now 17 and keeping out of sight in Odessa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the trials of our life have bonded us together, and even though we’ve experienced them from very different angles, we still have that underlying understanding of pain,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kyle and Jack&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; accompanied Maya to California in February to help find a place for her to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trip coincided with Beata’s birthday - she would have turned 52 this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trio celebrates the day together every year, whether it be with dinner, a cake or Beata’s favorite, gelato - this time, they found somewhere in LA where they could enjoy it in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of her mother’s death, Maya says, ‘we talked about her a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then I think when the trial happened, we all got very quiet – because long days, emotionally taxing days, and then we all had to decompress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now we still talk about her, and we’ll share memories, but it’s always in a really positive light.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Keeping her mother's memory alive  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family will recall expressions and words Beata would use, fondly remembering things she loved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are echoes of their matriarch throughout the new home – whether it be her rosary, which Maya keeps within easy reach on her bedroom desk, or their dog's middle name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They brought Chelsea Benya Kowalski - a Yorkie - home in the aftermath of the suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The middle name ‘doesn’t make sense to a lot of people,' Maya explained, 'but it’s a nickname in Polish for Beata.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During moments of doubt and difficulty, it’s her mother’s spirit that Maya tries to channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I obviously wish she was still here,' the teen says. But she remembers her mother as 'so bold and audacious and brave – and no BS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya holds her mother's rosary at the home she is preparing to leave. She has tried to channel Beata's drive as she takes the bold step to move across the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘She was very goal-driven, and… she had this self-respect that I admire so much. I wish I had a little bit more of that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya calls her ‘strong, like strongest person I know. And whenever I’m feeling uneasy or self-doubt creeps in, I try to picture my mom and think, “What would she do? She wouldn’t be bothered by this. She would stand her ground and be who she is, regardless of what anyone says."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The young adult hopes to memorialize her mother in other ways, too, through a dream totally separate from but just as important as her acting goals: She wants to do some type of charitable work helping others with chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once my court is wrapped up and once I’m situated, I would love to start putting in some plans to make this happen.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She believes here mother 'would be on board' fully with those charitable efforts, which 'would be so important to her emotionally' given the trauma that devastated the Kowalskis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya says she'll 'do my best to live up to that’ passion and devotion so strongly exhibited by her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maya says she'll 'do my best to live up to that’ passion and devotion so strongly exhibited by her mother, almost a decade after her life was upended &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the teen remains, remarkably, philosophical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sometimes bad things need to happen for progress to be made,’ she tells the Daily Mail. ‘And I look at my situation, and if I was the person that had to go through all this bad stuff, so be it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maya says that while she largely doesn't pay attention to social media comments, she sometimes takes a peek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when she sees social workers, nurses, doctors or anyone in the medical field leaving positive words, it's gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’ve been told that my documentary is used to educate medical professionals, and I can’t even begin to express how happy that makes me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This really negative thing happened, sure – but the people who need to hear it most… they’re learning from it,' she says. 'Maybe [it] won’t happen to other people. So that’s a fulfilling thing for me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 04:12:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNS1JxMEpXN2NnXzJ3czNISnhiczdjaGdVeGI3SHlYMmVPd2R5T1dzeE9vdnFEUVpJd0RzTDZ1ekRwbGJMUVZtektVTFNrVDRoTGZ5eVJpNEpyUjhoMHZXWGVfdUVnYU1XZHluclJNREJmMGFQaURNdURvU0xDU3ZNa2pBU0lYYldQdngwNkxoQ25JR3FMT2tKR2ZIbFdpRUJvUGlJTXpKbHp3VUdqTnc</guid></item><item><title>所有表明您可能有新冠疫苗受伤的迹象-每日邮报 | All the signs that mean YOU could have a Covid vaccine injury - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNjlFM0N2OXN1bWdWakc4VGFXTjVZb0lYUWlkRWxObWQ4TUwwZkVQU1IwVWROR05VX3MtTXVLZmgyV3NyQkNzYUFGdGxuMFZpeUlGdEhoeHc1aklYSFMtNXB4VGhvUG5GVzRXVlk1SkRQSHVWdEw3M2lEX20xbXRwYnBXc1pHTnZaU1FEZ1BOaWM4NVdMdlduc1FLZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Covid vaccines made by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-2e91b5b0-1a37-11f0-8183-9dc3b1229fb2"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-40668940-19fc-11f0-9cce-837db1b5260f" class=""&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; helped lift the world out of the pandemic, but&lt;span&gt; a small group of people were left with debilitating side effects that they attribute to the vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many were told there was no evidence the shot caused it — because there wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The situation changed slightly in February when a team from Yale University said they had discovered a new condition known as 'post-vaccination syndrome' (PVS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The syndrome appeared to cause neurological issues such as brain fog, headaches and dizziness, and many other symptoms including exercise intolerance, insomnia and inflammation of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of these symptoms were commonly reported before the pandemic, so there is no easy way to prove if they are actually caused by the vaccine or are unrelated, and the fragmented &lt;span&gt;US health care system complicates the picture further. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sujana Reddy, a physician specializing in vaccine-associated injury and long Covid, told the Daily Mail: 'For the vast majority of people, vaccines are safe and lifesaving. But we do need to acknowledge that, in a small subset of individuals... there may be a risk of persistent symptoms post-vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patients shouldn’t be dismissed. Just because something is rare doesn’t mean it’s not real.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Below, the Daily Mail reveals the symptoms research has linked to vaccines and what to do if you experience them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The previously-unknown condition, dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome' (PVS), can persist years after taking the mRNA vaccines— made by the likes of Pfizer and Moderna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2024 study looked at the conditions most associated with Covid vaccinations. Heart issues like pericarditis and myocarditis were most often linked to the shots &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Neurological symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Yale researchers reported that PVS is characterized by symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and 'brain fog'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who experience these symptoms may suffer from debilitating head pain, feeling faint, weak or unsteady, confusion, thinking difficulty, problems with concentration and diminishing memory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This group of symptoms are among the most common and usually develop within 48 hours of receiving a vaccine and become more severe in the following days and weeks, and can persist over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study by UK researchers found the most frequently reported adverse events after receiving the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca in the UK were headaches, cluster headaches, migraines and dizziness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the PVS patients analyzed by the Yale researchers, brain fog was reported in 78 percent of people and difficulty concentrating or focusing was reported by 73 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate 2024 analysis found brain fog was reported in about one in 1,000 doses of an mRNA Covid vaccine - such as Pfizer's - and 56 in 1,000 doses of an adenoviral vector vaccine - such as Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson/Janssen's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while headaches can be common side effects of vaccines, a 2021 study found headaches post Covid vaccine could be a sign of cerebral venous thrombosis - deadly blood clots that form in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Zoe Lees, who studies metabolic medicine, told the Daily Mail that it is 'common' to have headaches or dizziness after a vaccine but they typically resolve in a short timeframe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: These symptoms are more likely to be due to the body's immune response rather than direct damage to nerves. Severe or frequent symptoms are extremely rare'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added: 'If symptoms [last] more than a few weeks, it is appropriate to seek further evaluation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people experiencing headaches or migraines, treatment can include over-the-counter pain medication or prescription drugs, as well as lifestyle and diet changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatments for symptoms like dizziness, confusion and difficulty concentrating can vary widely based on the individual and people typically have to trial and error multiple therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Exercise intolerance &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale researchers found exercise intolerance was among the most commonly reported symptom of people with PVS — with 80 percent of people suffering from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2023 preprint paper found exercise intolerance was suffered by 71 percent of people reporting PVS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise intolerance is characterized by the inability or struggle to perform physical activity at a person's desired intensity or at the same caliber they exercised at prior to receiving a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may manifest as running out of breath sooner than usual or being too tired to start or complete a work out. People may also experience muscle weakness, aches or pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to being linked to PVS, exercise intolerance has also been associated with long Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yale researchers discovered that, in people experiencing exercise intolerance, despite the heart and lungs functioning normally, the body isn't able to properly extract and use oxygen from the blood as fuel that would normally allow a person to perform at their highest ability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There aren't many options for treating the condition, but doctors may prescribe high-dose vitamins and a medication used to treat muscle weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Fatigue and difficulty sleeping &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2023 preprint found excessive fatigue was experienced by 69 percent of people reporting PVS and the Yale researchers report 85 percent of people with PVS experienced the symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, 70 percent of PVS patients had trouble falling or staying asleep, according to the Yale researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the 2022 UK study reported poor quality sleep among the most frequently reported side effects after receiving a Covid vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 study examining the relationship between sleep and the Covid vaccines found people who experienced vaccine side effects had less and worse sleep than people who experienced no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thirteen percent of people had moderate to severe insomnia. Nearly four percent had trouble falling asleep; 6.8 percent couldn't stay asleep; and 7.4 percent were consistently waking up too early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while brain fog is a PVS symptom itself, lack of or poor sleep can contribute to it, making it harder to concentrate and think. It can also lead to mood changes like irritability and depression and cause an increased risk of obesity, heart disease and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-f383e740-1a27-11f0-8183-9dc3b1229fb2" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adequate sleep is crucial for the body to repair itself and for the immune system, helping to strengthen it to fend off viruses. People with PVS who suffer from poor sleep may be at a greater risk for other medical issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat sleep problems, doctors may recommend medications, talk therapy, or changes to a person's lifestyle and diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lees told the Daily Mail fatigue is also one of the most common side effects of getting a vaccine but it should subside within one to two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, if someone is still struggling with the symptom for more than six weeks, 'supportive treatment is offered in post-viral syndrome clinics.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rory Nairn (pictured here), a 26-year-old from New Zealand, died from myocarditis 12 days after receiving his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine in 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Myocarditis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium) that can reduce the heart's ability to pump blood effectively, potentially leading to heart failure, abnormal heartbeat and at times, sudden death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is usually caused by by a viral infection and there are less than 200,000 US cases per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with myocarditis may experience chest pain or tightness, shortness of breath, fatigue and loss of energy, swollen legs and irregular heartbeats.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, mRNA shots have been shown to cause myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the sac-like lining surrounding the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The side effect is rare but exactly how rare is still being debated. A major 2021 study in Israel put the rate at one in 50,000. Other studies have come to vastly different estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jared Ross, an emergency medicine physician and medical school professor, told the Daily Mail post-vaccine myocarditis is more common in males than females, especially under the age of 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said the condition typically develops after a viral infection, but can be triggered by a vaccine - most commonly the Moderna Covid vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC data shows post-vaccine myocarditis and pericarditis - inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart - are established side effects of Covid vaccination, though the agency does not provide a number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the conditions, it's thought the immune system may register mRNA in Covid vaccines as a threat, leading it to attack itself and cause inflammation of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both conditions have also been linked to Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in January 2025, Canadian experts began calling for more &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14329779/covid-vaccine-research-heart-effects-new-study.html"&gt;research into heart damage linked to Covid vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that the scale of the issue remains 'under-documented' due to the studies being too narrow and haven't looked at the risk of these injuries months and years after receiving the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers from British Columbia also warn that these studies have been inconsistent in how they classify 'postvaccine' myocarditis and pericarditis, using different timeframes to define if the conditions were directly linked to the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for myocarditis includes medications, lifestyle adjustments, rest, surgery or a heart transplant in severe cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Ross said: 'Thankfully, most patients fully recover.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tinnitus is a hearing problem that most commonly takes the form of persistent ringing in the ears&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tinnitus is a hearing problem that most commonly takes the form of persistent ringing in the ears. It can also sound like buzzing, roaring, hissing, or clicking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aside from being a nuisance and disruptive, tinnitus can cause frequent awakenings during the night, as the perceived sound becomes more noticeable in the quiet of the bedroom - disrupting the normal sleep cycle and causing insomnia and sleep deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When such sounds last more than six months, it's known as chronic tinnitus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology that analyzed a survey of 398 cases of Covid vaccination-related tinnitus found it occurred in 47 cases per million complete vaccinations with Pfizer's Covid shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also 51 cases of tinnitus per million complete vaccinations with Moderna's shot and 70 cases per million complete vaccinations with J&amp;amp;J/Janssen's shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hamid Djalilian, chief medical advisor for NeuroMed Tinnitus Clinic, told the Daily Mail the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has about 12,000 reports of tinnitus following a Covid vaccination, 'but compared to the millions of vaccines given, the overall rate is low.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team at Stanford Medicine Molecular Neurotology Laboratory is studying to find the underlying cause of tinnitus and identify people at risk of developing it after getting a vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Konstantina Stankovic, an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon who is leading the research, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/covid-vaccine-side-effects-tinnitus-may-linked-inflammation-rcna80675"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;: 'We think that many forms of tinnitus reflect some damage in the inner ear and then the brain tries to compensate for the damage and starts to make sound of its own.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research is ongoing and findings have not been published yet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat tinnitus, doctors typically prescribe steroids and one case study also saw doctors treat a patient with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment, which is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that uses magnetic pulses to adjust brain activity that may be causing the ear ringing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Djalilian said 'the best thing is to start supportive care' if you develop the condition following a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'This includes antioxidants, hydration, and rest. Staying calm is important, as anxiety and stress only makes things worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother-of-two from Montana, told the Daily Mail doctors diagnosed her with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Blood clots and low platelets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The co-occurrence of blood clots and low platelet counts following a Covid vaccination is a condition called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is a rare but serious condition that has been linked to the J&amp;amp;J/Janssen Covid vaccine, the CDC reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involves the formation of blood clots (thrombosis) together with a decrease in platelet count (thrombocytopenia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood clots can travel throughout the body and lead to deadly complications like strokes, while platelets are essential for blood to clot and for wounds to heal, so having too few could lead to uncontrolled, deadly bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include severe headaches, blurry vision, difficulty speaking, easy bruising, leg pain or swelling, excessive bleeding and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A CDC report from August 2021 stated there had been 38 cases of TTS within 15 days of Covid vaccinations and four patients had died as of July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the overall TTS rate was three cases per 1million doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early 2021, the FDA and CDC recommended pausing the use of the J&amp;amp;J/Janssen vaccine over concerns of its connection to TTS - with six cases having been reported up until that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2021, however, it lifted the pause after a safety review and the agencies stated the benefits outweighed potential risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More recent data on TTS after Covid vaccination is limited. One 2022 study found the rate was five cases per 130,000 people based on data from Norway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, researchers wrote, suggests an incidence of one case of TTS in 26,000 vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The precise mechanism by which Covid vaccines cause TTS is not known, but it is believed to be set off by some sort of immune response.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for TTS includes anti-clotting medications and an infusion of blood that contains certain antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kari Ponce de Leon, a 43-year-old mother-of-two from Montana, told the Daily Mail doctors diagnosed her with a series of blood conditions that caused her immune system to block platelets- similar to what happens with TTS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And one doctor wrote in a letter that her condition was likely caused by the Covid vaccine 'because he couldn't find any other reason.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Numbness or burning sensations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2022 UK study found one of the most frequently reported adverse events after receiving the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was paresthesia - tingling, numbness, prickling or burning sensations throughout the body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the 2023 preprint found 63 percent of people with PVS reported experiencing numbness and 63 also reported neuropathy - or nerve damage that causes pain, numbness, tingling or weakness most commonly in the arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numbness and burning sensations were also among the most common ailments suffered by PVS patients analyzed by the Yale researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eighty percent of people reported tingling and numbness and 58 percent reported burning sensations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for these symptoms can include over-the-counter pain medications, anti-inflammatory creams, anti-anxiety and anti-convulsant medications used off-label, physical and occupational therapy and lifestyle and diet changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ross explained to the Daily Mail that Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a neurological disorder in which the body's immune system attacks and damages nerves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes muscle weakness, numbness, and paralysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said GBS is caused by antibodies that attack the nervous system and it typically occurs after a viral infection or a vaccine - such as the one for Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include unsteady walking, trouble with facial movements and speaking and tingling and weakness most often in the feet, legs, arms and upper body. While most patients recover, severe cases can result in paralysis or death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, recent studies have found evidence suggesting an increased risk of GBS among adults aged 18 and older due to the Covid vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the August 2021 CDC report, the agency said that after 12.6million doses of the &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine, there had been &lt;/span&gt;100 reports of GBS &lt;span&gt;between February and June of that year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the time, the rate of GBS was roughly eight cases per million &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine doses. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate study from 2023 published in The Cureus Journal of Medical Science found that Covid shots like the &lt;span&gt;J&amp;amp;J/Janssen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; vaccine - which is a type of vector vaccine - &lt;/span&gt;could make a person over twice as likely to develop GBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vector vaccines use a harmless virus to deliver genetic material into the body to trigger an immune response against the targeted disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conducted a review of 70 studies on post-vaccination GBS and found 80 percent of the patients developed GBS within 21 days following the first dose of a vector vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lees told this website that one meta-analysis estimated the overall incidence of GBS to be four per 1million doses of an adenovirus vector vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Lees, who is a medical writer at ZipHealth, said a Covid-19 infection itself is associated with an increased risk of developing GBS - 'higher than any potential risk associated with vaccination.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While scientists are yet to determine how the vaccine can trigger GBS, they noted that most of the affected patients were successfully treated and only one death was reported due to autonomic dysfunction - a condition where involuntary body functions such as heart rate, blood pressure and digestion do not function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no direct cure for GBS and therapy concentrates on alleviating symptoms and preventing complications through blood transfusions, respiratory support and physical therapy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 04:09:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQNjlFM0N2OXN1bWdWakc4VGFXTjVZb0lYUWlkRWxObWQ4TUwwZkVQU1IwVWROR05VX3MtTXVLZmgyV3NyQkNzYUFGdGxuMFZpeUlGdEhoeHc1aklYSFMtNXB4VGhvUG5GVzRXVlk1SkRQSHVWdEw3M2lEX20xbXRwYnBXc1pHTnZaU1FEZ1BOaWM4NVdMdlduc1FLZw</guid></item><item><title>研究将大麻使用与痴呆风险增加联系起来- WKRC | Study links cannabis use to increased dementia risk - WKRC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowJBVV95cUxQN1NRZFRrYUhMRVE2M3kwbmNoa1BkVUN0bGZ5WFBVQWMxaE5CN1Q5N21ZcU04LU95M21mSG9kY3d1UFJvUjBRekJ3RHR5T21ickh6LVFYeXVWZXc2bXVQRng5MnZrd0IwdVprSWtIcTFHWC1aOE95QzVIU2h2MFFJWHlZaWFQbkNhMmc1ZERVYmgyWjBCREI0LWhnd25nNlFhRGtMbUVrcEdWR3YzczI1TlIxQTBEb3BSM2xqU0JuLXlCWU5rVG0zOElVWkN6R3ZnNVBIUmZuV3Z3ekw1cDUxS3RuaUp6LWpFMDNmMGs2alVCMWE1UWJuUE85c1hUR3RlNGhvMElMbDlmSHNtUjZvMTJNZkt6ejdzYW8yb2JiLUd6ZnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNDATED (WKRC/CNN Newsource) - As cannabis enthusiasts celebrated 420 Day, a new study has emerged linking regular cannabis use to an increased risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which examined more than 6 million Canadians, found that within five years of an emergency room visit or hospitalization related to cannabis, 5% of individuals were diagnosed with dementia.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While there are many causes of rectal bleeding, including benign conditions such as hemorrhoids, it is important to seek evaluation to rule out other dangerous, and potentially life-limiting conditions, such as colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, amongst other potential diseases,” says &lt;a href="https://www.manhattangastroenterology.com/dr-michael-schopis/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michael Schopis, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Manhattan Gastroenterology.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Abdominal pain is something that is tricky because it sometimes just feels like a stomach ache.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “New evidence has shown that bloating can be an early sign of intestinal inflammation and, left untreated, can lead to other chronic health issues,” says &lt;a href="https://kennethbrownmd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kenneth Brown, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas-based gastroenterologist.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People gain or lose weight all the time, but if you’re losing weight and don’t understand why, it may be time to consult a GI doctor. “Weight loss will typically come as a loss of 10 pounds or more very suddenly without the person changing any of their exercise or eating habits,” says Cox. This could signal an underlying health issue that hinders nutrient absorption or lowers appetite. Some examples are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/celiac-disease-and-sneaky-signs-you-might-have-it-8652999" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt; or inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Changes in the color, consistency or shape of your stools might be a sign that it’s time to see a gastroenterologist. “A change in bowel habits is a sign that people will notice if they look at their stool and see differences in color and consistency or notice a stark change in how often they are having bowel movements,” says Cox. If this is you, schedule a visit with your doctor to see if there’s an underlying reason for these changes.

You Have Recurring Heartburn &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chronic heartburn can be tricky because sometimes it might seem like indigestion and people won’t pay much attention to it. But if you’re feeling a burning pain in your chest near your sternum, this is a telltale sign that it is heartburn and not just indigestion,” says Cox. It might be a sign of a hiatal hernia or gastroesophageal &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-acid-reflux-8760717" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reflux disease&lt;/a&gt; (GERD), so see a doctor for a thorough evaluation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

You Have Swallowing Difficulties &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Trouble swallowing can come in a few forms, such as food coming up in the throat or if food feels as if it’s stuck in your throat or chest,” says Cox. Persistent pain with swallowing is another thing to look out for. According to Schopis, your doctor might schedule an endoscopy so they can evaluate your gastrointestinal tract with a camera.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you notice any of the above symptoms, it’s worth seeing your health care provider. Other symptoms that warrant a doctor’s visit, according to Schopis, include persistent nausea or vomiting, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676216/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-iron-deficiency/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt; anemia or black or bloody stools. Your doctor can do further testing to see if your symptoms are a sign of an underlying health issue. “Many conditions are readily treatable if diagnosed early,” says Cox. So it’s worth seeing your doctor proactively to prevent the issue from progressing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it can be tempting to minimize digestive issues, it's better to be safe than sorry. A gastroenterologist can provide a thorough evaluation to ensure there isn’t something more serious going on. So if you experience symptoms like rectal bleeding, persistent diarrhea, bloating or heartburn or intense abdominal pain, to name a few, it’s time to see a gastroenterologist. While these symptoms may be benign, it’s best to see a GI doctor so that if there is something wrong, you can catch it early.&lt;br&gt;

"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors," the 43-year-old from Ipswich tells the BBC. "I didn't want to be a burden."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dan's pain continued to get worse, until he was "near enough screaming on the floor in pain" and had to take time off work.

But according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthcaresystem/datasets/experiencesofnhshealthcareservicesinengland" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;ONS Health Insight Survey&lt;/a&gt; from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and "rarely or never" used a pharmacy, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They also make up &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-outpatient-activity/2023-24" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments&lt;/a&gt; than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Men are "less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function," says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This all &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clywrl5460jo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;affects men's health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to "tough it out" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Society associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. "Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns," says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'Men are inherent problem-solvers'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem," says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report "self-managing" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence," Prof Galdas says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bda/live/f2655970-1cfc-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Kevin McMullan A man in a black t-shirt in front of a plain background smiles at the camera" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Kevin McMullan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Kevin McMullan says many men try solve their own mental health problems&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Services also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Women, in contrast, are "sort of forced to engage in the health system" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Because women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says.

And while the exact &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is currently under investigation, there is one interesting finding related to your blood levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're finding that people diagnosed with colon cancer have &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;low vitamin D levels&lt;/a&gt;,” says vice president of in-office care at One Medical &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md"}' href="https://www.hlth.com/2023event/speakers/natasha-bhuyan-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Natasha Bhuyan&lt;/a&gt;, MD. And while the correlation is still a bit chicken-or-the-egg (“this discovery is in the really, really early stages,” Bhuyan adds), there's something else to note: results from a couple of studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9537583/" target="_blank"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4229786/" target="_blank"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which reveal a “deficiency of vitamin D increases the incidence of colon cancer and also has a negative impact on the survival of colon cancer patients,” it might be time to ask to have your levels looked at the next time you're at the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a blood test will officially reveal if you're deficient. But with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4018438/" target="_blank"&gt;research showing&lt;/a&gt; that almost a billion people on the planet are deficient in vitamin D, it's worth asking your doctor for a test next time you're getting a physical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; plays an important role in both our physical and mental health, helping build strong bones, keep the immune system strong, and balance mental health. Bhuyan advises that there are actually a variety of ways to keep your vitamin D levels healthy. “Some people will eat &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/meals-rich-in-vitamin-d-and-magnesium" target="_blank"&gt;a vitamin-D-rich diet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-vitamin-d" target="_blank"&gt;fortified foods&lt;/a&gt;,” she says. “There's also the option of taking a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-benefits-winter" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/serotonin-vitamin-d-sun" target="_blank"&gt;spending time in the sun&lt;/a&gt; because that helps your body make it naturally. But we always advise you to be really cautious about spending time in the sun, because it can also increase your risk of skin cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the new diagnosis statistics are startling (“diagnoses of people under 55 years of age doubled from 11% (1 in 10) in 1995 to 20% (1 in 5) in 2019,” reads a press release from the &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/CRCFactsFigures2023" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;) for Gen Z, Millennials, and Generation X, knowledge can truly be power in this instance. And maybe eating more vitamin D can be, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 23:31:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE5RX1hKM2tOMmhsUHdqV3haTEw0X0RENUFoc3kyN1BzblJnbWt1Q1dna0lBRVlSZzJmdEVMVUVoOHFKVWdoRmdnSG40cXYxOVBHQjJhbU9zWXBJdkw1TkM0TktjMTZyWjZsSnh5cQ</guid></item><item><title>“运动型”女性在腰痛被误诊为坐骨神经痛后死亡-独立报 | ‘Athletic’ woman dies after lower back pain was misdiagnosed as sciatica - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxOazhCc0xBUU9ibFJXcXRQNmZ6bmRiVnJycHRmTTh4WDY3RDAza2dUenJVaHpJUWttWElRZWJFeVBFY0dSMkFvT3l6cXR4SWw0bUN5YUVabkF1d0V5Z0JWZGotV053NjhwX2FVUnM5OUh4eDZmVkNYVnVzRGllMHZOR0JCWU1XUno1NTBBUnh3ZXlpbU5QbVVXX3l6ZFNzdkFKNmprclN3TlVyX2ZHZENhVWlFOFFTeFM1U2VwMERFQVdHSkZJaGlN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 cDGSNR"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 kxbAkl"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 kGYWZt"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

pandemic, and she thought this was due to poor posture or a slightly uncomfortable working set-up,” Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By January 2021, the pain was more persistent and she had some new pain radiating into her hip as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="6" class="sc-482ou5-0 jjunLz"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=291%2C0%2C349%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/04/20/8/59/PA-Real-Life-Sarcoma-3.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=291%2C0%2C349%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Kate was given emergency radiotherapy and started chemotherapy treatment" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-20007"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Kate was given emergency radiotherapy and started chemotherapy treatment&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a pet parent to know that dogs and cats are like night and day. The history of dogs, at least in their current form, traces back around 15,000 years. According to current scientific consensus, toward the end of the Last Ice Age, more submissive individuals within the gray wolf population began adapting to human interaction in ways they hadn’t before. Many of the friendly traits these proto-dogs developed are still with us, only now, they’re genetically wired to &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/03/29/dogs-understand-our-words-more-than-they-let-on-science-reveals/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/03/29/dogs-understand-our-words-more-than-they-let-on-science-reveals/" target="_self" aria-label="read and respond to us"&gt;read and respond to us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike dogs, cats appear to have “domesticated themselves,” choosing to live alongside humans while maintaining their independence, a process that began 9,000 years ago. That might sound on-brand for cat meme material, but the science backs it up. Housecat DNA remains largely unchanged from their wild ancestors, and history has shown that these furballs are never too far from &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/07/14/a-house-cat-was-brought-to-a-remote-island-in-1894-a-year-later-a-species-was-extinct/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/07/14/a-house-cat-was-brought-to-a-remote-island-in-1894-a-year-later-a-species-was-extinct/" target="_self" aria-label="flipping back into elite predator mode when the right opportunity strikes"&gt;flipping back into elite predator mode when the right opportunity strikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this context makes the story of France’s 1960s feline space mission even heavier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In The ’60s, Cats Were ‘Chosen’ From The Streets Of Paris For A Secret Space Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, the United States made &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/04/19/3-animals-you-didnt-know-went-to-space---one-might-still-be-out-there-waiting-to-wake-up/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/04/19/3-animals-you-didnt-know-went-to-space---one-might-still-be-out-there-waiting-to-wake-up/" target="_self" aria-label="space history with a swarm of fruit flies"&gt;space history with a swarm of fruit flies&lt;/a&gt;. Launched aboard a captured German rocket, these unusual passengers were sent to study the effects of cosmic radiation on living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Cold War escalated, space became the stage for geopolitical flexing. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R were aiming for more than just technological milestones. It was a brazen display of ideological one-upmanship. In 1957, the Soviets launched Laika into space, and by the early ’60s, animals had become central to space programs around the world, their lives traded for data in the race beyond Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the backdrop in which France — late to the party but eager to join the club — made a curious choice. While the Soviets sent dogs and the Americans trained primates, France turned to stray cats, plucked from the streets of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen female cats were brought in by scientists at CERMA, France’s space medicine program. None of them were named. In fact, in a small attempt to keep things clinical, they were deliberately given ID numbers instead of names. It was treated as pre-launch protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cats were wired up with electrodes to monitor brain activity and put through a bootcamp of sorts. They were confined in tight containers for long periods, just to observe their reactions. Then came the centrifuge — designed to simulate the crushing G-forces of launch and re-entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For animals that had once stalked alleyways and rooftops, it was an abrupt shift in lifestyle. Eventually, six cats made it to the final round. One of them, a black-and-white tuxedo with the designation C341, stood out. Not because she was stronger, faster or more willing, but because she was the one who got chosen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An unnamed stray, strapped into a capsule, headed for a once-in-a-lifetime journey past the Kármán line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C341’s Launch Day In The Algerian Sahara, October 18, 1963&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slender Veronique AGI rocket stood poised at the Interarmy Special Vehicles Test Centre in the Algerian Sahara. There was no towering launch tower. Instead, there were four long legs holding it upright. Inside the capsule sat C341 — still unnamed, still wired up and still unaware she was a participant in a geopolitical power struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rocket lifted off just after 8 a.m. and carried her beyond the bureaucratic boundary of space, the Kármán line. She hit &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-missions/felicette-first-cat-space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-missions/felicette-first-cat-space" aria-label="9.5 g on the way up"&gt;9.5 g on the way up&lt;/a&gt;, spent a few minutes in weightlessness, then came back down under 7 g, sealed inside a capsule with no windows and no context. It lasted 13 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She flew 57 kilometers past the accepted edge of space, and minutes later, she landed upside down in the sand. When the press got hold of the story and assumed the space cat was male, they called her Félix. The scientists corrected them — Félicette. And with that, C341 finally had a name. However, it would take decades for anyone to remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-base embedly-align"&gt;&lt;fbs-embedly iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fv-tpmvGRoyw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dv-tpmvGRoyw&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fv-tpmvGRoyw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube"&gt;&lt;/fbs-embedly&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Autopsy That Taught No One Anything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Félicette didn’t get a reunion tour or a retirement cushion. Just a few weeks after her return, she was euthanized so scientists at CERMA could study her body. The goal was to see how spaceflight had affected her internal systems. But the results were underwhelming. Whatever they were hoping to find, they didn’t. The postmortem taught them little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, she was cataloged like any other lab subject. One experiment in a series. The only cat ever sent to space, and yet, for years, barely a footnote in history. That would change. But not for a while, and not in the &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/01/11/the-tragic-story-of-laika-the-soviet-canine-cosmonaut-who-made-space-history-in-1957/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2025/01/11/the-tragic-story-of-laika-the-soviet-canine-cosmonaut-who-made-space-history-in-1957/" target="_self" aria-label="same way we remember Laika"&gt;same way we remember Laika&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Félicette Was Remembered Again, But Only Sort Of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Félicette’s story was rediscovered in an era that had grown more reflective about the costs of our ambitions, particularly on non-consenting, non-human participants. In 2019, a statue was unveiled in her honor at the International Space University in Strasbourg. Cast in bronze, it showed her sitting atop Earth, looking up at the stars she once flew so close to. This gesture was the best we could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it’s only human to romanticize her, part of what makes her story so tragic is how unromantic it is. No one claimed she volunteered. She was a street cat who ended up strapped into a rocket. And yet, something about her legacy painfully lingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be because cats, despite all their independence, have evolved to understand us in subtle, unsettling ways. They respond to human emotion. They know how to earn food, how to navigate social cues and how to win affection without losing autonomy. Evolution, it seems, didn’t overwrite their instincts, it just &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1410083111" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1410083111" aria-label="rewired how they manage risk and reward in human environments"&gt;rewired how they manage risk and reward in human environments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, Félicette was the perfect subject: independent enough to survive the streets of Paris, adaptable enough to tolerate confinement and familiar enough for her absence to finally sting — just a few decades too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While Félicette’s story is a slow burn, the cost of human progess has turned into a display of the snowball effect in action.

Because it’s not only the exceptions who are redefining what is athletically possible later in life: &lt;a href="https://www.worldmarathonmajors.com/stars" target="_blank"&gt;the average age &lt;/a&gt;of a person finishing the World Marathon Majors is now 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Some recent science has helped bust myths around what people of middle-age and beyond can do safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“We are still fighting the old message that people need to slow down when they hit a certain age, but there is no core reason to tell someone that they can’t keep training like an athlete,” said Scott Trappe, who studies human performance and aging, and is the director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University in Indiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="BodyImage__BodyImagePhoto-sc-xeeopr-0 hMFmrT l-align l-align--right"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/TNY3DRNHCFAKVADVXUSRWKN4PU.JPG?auth=048422dec690bcc068dbcea34d6f0bc7580cb5e567923951ed67b1116ab669b8&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=400&amp;amp;quality=80&amp;amp;smart=true" aria-haspopup="true" data-photo-viewer-index="2"&gt;&lt;span class="u-visually-hidden"&gt;Open this photo in gallery:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-image-figcap c-image-figcap--block"&gt;&lt;div class="figcap-grid"&gt;&lt;div class="figcap-cc"&gt;&lt;p class="figcap-text"&gt;&lt;span class="caption text-gmr-4"&gt;Ed Whitlock, 74, crosses the finish line of the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon in just over three hours on Sept. 25, 2005.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit text-gmr-5"&gt;Tibor Kolley/The Globe and Mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;He explains how excessive caution in research has held back generations of seniors from exercising like athletes. In the 1980s, for example, studies showed that exercise did not lead to physiological adaptations in elderly people as it did in younger ones, suggesting that it may not be worth the trouble. As a result,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;many seniors limited their workouts to walking or &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070104013103/http://www.jazzercise.com/companyinfo.htm"&gt;jazzercise &lt;/a&gt;(look it up).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;But these studies, designed by researchers wary of injuring their participants, were not rigorous enough to generate physiological benefits, Trappe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Later research uncovered that the body’s response to cardiovascular exercise does not change much with age: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1540458/#:~:text=In%20conclusion%2C%20exercise%20enhances%20mitochondria,concomitant%20increases%20in%20mitochondria%20biogenesis."&gt;mitochondria still grow and multiply&lt;/a&gt;, capillary networks still &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/exercise-and-your-arteries"&gt;expand&lt;/a&gt; to improve blood flow, and metabolic enzymes still become more active and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4048572/#:~:text=Exercise%20requires%20a%20high%20amount,also%20by%20phosphorylating%20metabolic%20enzymes."&gt;better at converting fuel into energy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The belief that intense exercise would probably harm healthy elderly people was shown to be a tall tale – one of the same flavour that led early 20th-century scientists to believe that women’s uteruses would &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17632029"&gt;fall out&lt;/a&gt; should they run a full marathon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;“If you keep training, the body continues to respond to exercise in a positive manner deep into life,” said Trappe, who at 58, trains and competes as a triathlete, and does a weekly pool workout with a former colleague, who is 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Exercising in old age does come with a long list of potential pitfalls. One of the biggest is expecting the same performance as in earlier years and failing to account for natural physiological decline – such as a less efficient heart and reduced blood volume – which can lead to overtraining or injury. Orthopedic challenges that were not a concern earlier in life, like a bum knee or hip, are also common. And exercising with health conditions like diabetes or cancer brings a whole new list of considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;A good way to set oneself up for vigorous exercise later in life is to do it earlier in life, too. &lt;a href="https://www.sleepclinic.be/wp-content/uploads/Long-term-Change-in-Cardiorespiratory-Fitness-and-All-Cause-Mortality.pdf"&gt;Cardiovascular fitness&lt;/a&gt;, or VO2 max, is one of the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality in the world, and strength training two to three times a week can help stave off a number of conditions including osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, and heart issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The good news is that we are entering a golden age of fitness across age groups. Multigenerational sports such as pickleball are thriving, while age-group competitions at major events such as marathons and Ironman races are drawing more participants. Advances in gear are also improving performance and making it easier than ever for athletes to train in ways that support recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;And then there is representation: The more we see people older than 30 accomplishing impressive sport feats, the more we come to expect it and may eventually try it for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Yet, all this does not mean that we are sailing toward a future where everyone runs marathons beyond retirement age. Our work lives, which have become more sedentary, make us less fit than they used to, Trappe says. This leads to huge differences in health between those who invest in their fitness early and throughout life, and those who do not. It reminds me of a phrase on a poster at the physiotherapy clinic I frequent in Toronto: It’s easier to maintain fitness than to build it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Trappe agrees. “In our current conditions, vigorous exercise may be the most powerful medicine out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Globe and Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 19:41:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOMG15dS15X3M2RXQwMDNCZlh3alYydTlNb0lDM1dRbUF0TldHRldfTnpubEZfN3hIbFdUUUthS3Nod2VNT3B2ekFjSU1rWU5CWUlhbW45cG0xR3o4dHlxZE10cEZPbzB0V1UwMVlCYVN2VWxvaDFsaDFQYlF6R2JGZEx5NnpGTXVIWmJBaHRqQlEzaXM5bTVCd1VvYzhGZ29PTlNGUWNwMmhvb2QwZlpRYlBB</guid></item><item><title>路易斯安那州、密苏里州和弗吉尼亚州报告2025年首例麻疹病例- NBC新闻 | Louisiana, Missouri and Virginia report first measles cases of 2025 - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPc1l0bjhnai1WaGtkX05rRGpXZUVRYmtfOWhCTXdnNnZENkduMEZnWExzaTAxeUJ5M2tHWE5UNHc5c2pMTmpnV1MxNVowaUwtYWJ3WFZpRnVXRko1QUlEREZrRFY3bXRqV2ZLMzBvQVVhMzAyUm5RSWlZMjVXcUFSQUpKUmN4TjJaRTFyU1Uxb1NLcUgzNVNXd2JDTXVVbmpYT0d6b2wya1h4YnPSAVZBVV95cUxNWENwVV9ITEdwdFBkU3pCdFdwdFQ5cVdKOTQ4V3BWUHNhRmN1V0dicnhDMWVkQWVqeUtVWE5rVFduRHVpZ29oZGk0dnZPa1E0VUowMDl5QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Louisiana, Missouri and Virginia have all reported their first measles cases in 2025, and they say all three patients’ cases are linked to international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The most recently announced case in northwest Virginia is a child in the 0 to 4-year age range who had recently traveled internationally, according to the state’s health department.

			&lt;p&gt;Amid very real worries that tech is eroding our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/even-just-having-your-phone-in-view-reduces-your-brain-power-says-a-new-study"&gt;cognitive skills&lt;/a&gt; – why learn math or facts when you always have a calculator and Google? – a new study suggests that staying tech-savvy later in life can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shock-link-found-between-marriage-and-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Texas analyzed data from 57 previous studies, covering more than 411,000 people aged over 50, to look at the link between digital tech habits and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/up-to-13-of-dementia-cases-could-be-a-misdiagnosed-treatable-condition"&gt;cases of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You can flip on the news on just about any day and you'll see people talking about how technologies are harming us," &lt;a href="https://news.web.baylor.edu/news/story/2025/digital-dementia-does-technology-use-digital-pioneers-correlate-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychologist and neuroscientist Michael Scullin, from Baylor University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People often use the terms 'brain drain' and 'brain rot', and now digital dementia is an emerging phrase. As researchers, we wanted to know if this was true."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158365" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyChart.jpg" alt="Study chart" class="wp-image-158365 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/StudyChart-600x316.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158365" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers collated data from multiple studies, which all took different approaches. (Benge and Scullin, &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistical analysis showed that technology use was associated with a 58 percent reduction in the risk of cognitive impairment. Additionally, tech users showed between 26 and 34 percent lower rates of cognitive decline over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that this isn't the type of research that can prove direct cause and effect. Each study used different approaches, and measured technology use in a different way: some studies looked at smartphone use, for example, while others were measuring &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scrolling-through-social-media-has-a-unique-effect-on-your-body"&gt;social media use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the reduction in risk still held after adjustments for factors including occupation, education, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;. It seems there is a link here, which is worth investigating in further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our data suggests encouraging older adults to engage with technology, particularly in a manner that helps challenge, connect, and compensate for cognitive problems, could be a powerful approach to promoting cognitive health," &lt;a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2025/04/14/technology-use-linked-to-better-brain-health-in-older-adults/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropsychologist Jared Benge, from the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology use could help protect against cognitive decline and dementia in a few different ways, the researchers suggest. It might help to stimulate the brain, for instance, especially when it comes to learning how to use new devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech can also keep us better connected, with social media and video calls. We already know that being lonely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/loneliness-proteins-in-your-blood-could-be-putting-your-health-at-risk"&gt;is associated with&lt;/a&gt; a higher chance of developing dementia, while maintaining social ties can keep the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;brain humming along&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the idea of technology acting as 'scaffolding' around a drop in mental capabilities, and keeping elderly people more independent for longer – apps helping with reminders for medications and health appointments, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a complex picture, with a lot of factors involved, but given the broad reach of this new study and the large sample size, it could well be worth maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-6g-wireless-tech-is-500-times-faster-than-average-5g-smartphones"&gt;our relationship with tech&lt;/a&gt; as we get older – and helping others to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you have a parent or grandparent who's just staying away from technology, maybe revisit that," &lt;a href="https://news.web.baylor.edu/news/story/2025/digital-dementia-does-technology-use-digital-pioneers-correlate-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Scullin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Could they learn to use photo, messaging, or calendar apps on a smartphone or tablet? Start simple and be very patient while they learn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02159-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Blood vessels at the back of your eye may one day alert doctors to signs of early dementia, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-eyesight-could-be-putting-you-at-risk-of-developing-alzheimers"&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-vision-can-predict-dementia-12-years-before-diagnosis-study-discovers"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-could-tell-if-you-have-early-signs-of-dementia-with-high-accuracy"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-crucial-link-between-eye-disease-alzheimers"&gt;links&lt;/a&gt; between eye problems and dementia risk. Plaques of amyloid beta proteins, a hallmark of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="158444" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00921/full"&gt;have even been found&lt;/a&gt; in the retinas of people who have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eye-test-could-predict-cognitive-decline-before-alzheimer-s-takes-hold"&gt;Three years ago&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from the University of Otago in New Zealand discovered that thinning in a person's retina in middle age can be linked to cognitive performance in their early and adult life. That's the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists suspected these findings could &lt;span&gt;one day pave the way towards a simple eye test to help predict a person's risk for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Now, some members of that team have followed the hunch a step further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p paraid="1791504846" paraeid="{3f1d0684-7ab2-4f3a-b57b-23d27b101470}{141}"&gt;"It's thought that many of the disease processes in Alzheimer's are reflected in the retina, making it a good target as a biomarker to identify people at risk of developing dementia."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Barrett-Young and colleagues returned to the longitudinal database used in their &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2788716"&gt;2022 research&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/"&gt;Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study&lt;/a&gt;, which tracked 45 years of health data from New Zealanders born in 1972 and 1973.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their new research, the team only used data collected from 938 participants at age 45, including retinal photographs, eye scans, and a battery of tests that gauge midlife risk of Alzheimer's and related dementias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating the major part of their 2022 study, they checked for associations between cognitive decline and retinal layer thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They took special care over the layer of nerve fibers closest to the jelly-filled vitreous cavity that 'fills out' our rounded eyes, and its neighboring layers of ganglion cells and inner plexiform&lt;span&gt;. The nerve fiber layer is particularly important because it carries visual signals to the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158449" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158449" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/07902loa.jpg" alt="cross-section greyscale microscope image of retinal layers as horizontal stripes, from top to bottom labelled nerve fiber layer, layer of ganglion cells, inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer, outer plexiform layer, photoceptor layer (rods and cones) and retinal pigment epithelium.

(&lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/phpbin/medlib/histology/p/07902loa.htm"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked for possible associations with retinal microvascular health, ascertained by measuring the diameter of tiny arteries and veins in the retina. These "&lt;span&gt;are believed to reflect the integrity of the overall cardiovascular system of the body (including the cerebrovasculature), which is implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and, in particular, vascular dementias," the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.6082"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that, at least for the 45-year-old Kiwis involved in the study, retinal microvascular health was a much stronger predictor of dementia risk than the nerve fiber layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While thickness of the nerve fiber layer (though not the g&lt;span&gt;anglion cell–inner plexiform layer) was weakly associated with dementia risk, it was nowhere near as strong as the microvascular link.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found dementia risk scores were usually higher among people with narrower &lt;span&gt;arterioles (tiny vessels that carry blood away from the heart) and wider venules (miniature veins that receive blood from capillaries).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals won't be putting the findings of this study into action just yet, because it's too population-specific and observational. Also, as the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251321114"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt;, while the dementia risk measures are "&lt;span&gt;highly predictive of the likelihood of dementia decades later", they are by no means a direct measure of actual disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it seems we're getting closer to a world where a routine eye check could help flag the risk of dementia before it hits, and give you more time to plan treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Treatments for Alzheimer's and some other forms of dementia may be most effective if they're started early in the disease course," Barrett-Young &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/eye-health-linked-to-dementia-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251321114"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if a pill meant to help you sleep could also protect your brain from one of the most devastating diseases of our time? A new study suggests that a popular insomnia drug might act as an unexpected Alzheimer’s preventative, offering fresh hope in the long and difficult fight against memory loss and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long believed that poor sleep is linked to higher Alzheimer’s risk. Disrupted sleep often appears years before symptoms like forgetfulness or confusion, and researchers believe that’s no coincidence. Deep, high-quality sleep is when the brain gets a chance to clear out waste, including harmful proteins like amyloid-beta and tau that build up in Alzheimer’s patients.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Washington University in St. Louis have taken that connection one step further. In &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ana.26641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt;, they found that the sleeping pill suvorexant (commonly prescribed for insomnia) may help reduce the levels of those same proteins, even after just two nights of use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="is-wp-image-block wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?quality=82&amp;amp;strip=all" alt="woman sleeping in bed" class="is-wp-image-block wp-image-5932329" srcset="https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?quality=82 2560w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;amp;quality=82 150w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;amp;quality=82 300w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;amp;quality=82 768w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;amp;quality=82 1024w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;amp;quality=82 1536w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;amp;quality=82 2048w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=178%2C100&amp;amp;quality=82 178w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=190%2C107&amp;amp;quality=82 190w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=260%2C146&amp;amp;quality=82 260w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=360%2C203&amp;amp;quality=82 360w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=380%2C214&amp;amp;quality=82 380w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=389%2C219&amp;amp;quality=82 389w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=510%2C287&amp;amp;quality=82 510w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=520%2C293&amp;amp;quality=82 520w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=600%2C338&amp;amp;quality=82 600w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=720%2C405&amp;amp;quality=82 720w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=778%2C438&amp;amp;quality=82 778w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=1020%2C574&amp;amp;quality=82 1020w, https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rsz_adobestock_273856500.jpg?resize=75%2C42&amp;amp;quality=82 75w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="is-wp-image-block wp-element-caption"&gt;Good sleep is still one of the most effective ways to combat cognitive decline. Image source: Gorodenkoff/Adobe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, 38 healthy middle-aged adults were given a dose of suvorexant or a placebo. Those who took the drug saw a 10 to 20 percent drop in amyloid-beta levels in their brain fluid as well as a temporary dip in tau proteins. These results are early but promising and suggest that improving sleep may offer more than just rest; it could act as an unexpected preventative for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

The drop in protein levels was short-lived, and long-term use of sleeping pills can come with side effects like dependence and shallower sleep. Plus, there’s still debate in the scientific community about whether lowering amyloid is the key to stopping Alzheimer’s at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still don’t know &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/yale-breakthrough-may-uncover-the-root-cause-of-alzheimers/"&gt;the root cause of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, which is slowing down any chance of finding a cure. Still, the takeaway is compelling. Better sleep might help defend the brain. And while it’s too soon to recommend sleeping pills as a cure or preventative treatment, the results underscore how crucial sleep is for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until more research is done, experts suggest focusing on natural sleep strategies like consistent bedtimes, limiting screen time before bed, and treating sleep apnea. At least we can &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bgr.com/science/this-ai-can-tell-if-you-might-develop-alzheimers-just-by-hearing-you-speak/"&gt;count on AI to help diagnose Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; more easily while we continue searching for a cure.&lt;/p&gt;

This concerning symptom prompted an emergency hospital visit, leading to a startling discovery that has fascinated medical professionals. Inside his kidney, doctors found a parasitic worm measuring approximately 30 centimeters in length, actively living within his renal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unusual case of urinary obstruction reveals shocking parasite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival at the emergency department, the patient displayed mostly normal vital signs, with the exception of mild tachycardia. Medical staff noted significant kidney swelling during their initial examination. Blood tests indicated a possible infection, leading the medical team to implement immediate treatment protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors inserted a catheter to relieve the patient’s urinary retention and administered &lt;strong&gt;intravenous fluids along with antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt; to address the suspected infection. The patient remained under observation overnight as medical staff monitored his condition closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following morning brought a disturbing revelation. The collection bag attached to the catheter contained blood-tinged urine—and swimming within this fluid was a long, thin parasite. This unexpected discovery explained the patient’s inability to urinate, as the creature had been physically obstructing his urinary tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parasite measured approximately 30 centimeters in length with a width of 3-4 millimeters. Microbiological examination identified it as a male specimen of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt;, commonly known as the giant kidney worm—a rare parasitic infection in humans that perfectly matched the patient’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Giant kidney worm infection: causes and transmission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; parasite represents one of the largest worms capable of infecting humans. These formidable parasites can survive up to five years within the kidney of their host, causing progressive damage to renal tissue and function over time. Female specimens can grow even more impressive in size, potentially exceeding one meter in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When investigating the source of infection, doctors learned that the patient frequently consumed raw fish from a lake near his village. The patient confirmed this dietary habit and made a surprising admission—he had previously observed similar worms in his urine on other occasions, suggesting repeated infections despite the rarity of human cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transmission cycle of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; typically involves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eggs released into water through infected animal urine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aquatic organisms like oligochaetes consuming these eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fish or amphibians ingesting infected intermediate hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humans becoming infected through consumption of undercooked aquatic organisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of water in India represents a crucial factor in this case. Environmental contamination significantly increases the risk of parasitic infections from consuming raw or undercooked fish from local water bodies, as these environments may harbor various stages of the parasite’s life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medical management and patient outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment approach for this patient involved both supportive care and monitoring. After the initial parasite was expelled “naturally” through the urinary tract, doctors recommended an extended hospital stay for observation. However, the patient elected to return home against medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more severe cases of &lt;strong&gt;kidney worm infestation&lt;/strong&gt;, surgical intervention may become necessary. The parasite can cause significant damage to renal tissue, potentially leading to kidney dysfunction or failure if left untreated. When multiple parasites are present or when they’ve embedded deeply into renal structures, surgical extraction offers the most definitive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Symptom&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Potential Indication&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Medical Response&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inability to urinate&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Physical obstruction of urinary tract&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Catheterization&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Blood in urine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Tissue damage from parasite&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Antibiotics, monitoring&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kidney swelling&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Inflammatory response to infection&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Anti-inflammatory medication&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Abdominal pain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Parasite movement or tissue damage&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Pain management, parasite removal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical literature contains few documented human cases of &lt;em&gt;Dioctophyma renale&lt;/em&gt; infection, making this patient’s experience particularly noteworthy. Most infections occur in wild animals like mink, wolves, and dogs, with humans serving as accidental hosts when consuming contaminated food or water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventive measures against parasitic infections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unusual case highlights the importance of food safety practices, particularly when consuming fish and other aquatic organisms. Prevention strategies should include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly cooking all fish and seafood before consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding raw fish dishes from unregulated or questionable sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being cautious about water quality, especially in regions with limited sanitation infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeking prompt medical attention for unusual urinary symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following regular deworming protocols in high-risk areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While cases of human infection with &lt;strong&gt;giant kidney worms remain exceptionally rare&lt;/strong&gt;, they underscore the potential health risks associated with consuming raw or undercooked fish, particularly from freshwater sources in regions with suboptimal water quality. Understanding transmission patterns and maintaining vigilance regarding food preparation can help prevent such dramatic medical emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient’s previous encounters with similar parasites suggest that enhanced public health education in vulnerable communities could significantly reduce infection risks. By prioritizing food safety and seeking timely medical care for unusual symptoms, individuals can avoid the painful and potentially dangerous consequences of renal parasitic infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So she felt it was a cruel twist of fate when she contracted a rare neurological disease that took away her ability to speak and left her paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Abraham, 45 from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-c1c51da0-1c8e-11f0-864e-fb0d2908420c"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, had spent over 15 years helping children overcome speech obstacles and teaching them how to talk, but in March 2019, her life came to a standstill after she began to experience a severe case of the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-d5202c30-1bc8-11f0-824d-096c5aadc1b7" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She suffered from extreme exhaustion, body aches, nausea and vomiting, and soon, her voice began to wane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was quickly taken to her local emergency room but within two days had to be moved to the intensive care unit after facing respiratory failure and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sport/mlb/article-14544407/Freddie-Freemans-wife-shares-vital-health-update-son-4-amid-battle-heartbreaking-rare-disease.html"&gt;progressive paralysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Abraham wasn't a stranger to the ICU, having treated patients in the hospital rooms during her career. But now, she was the patient.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom-of-one told DailyMail.com: 'In the ICU, I was unable to move my arm or hold my head up. The neck muscles were so weak that my neck basically fell to the side, and I had to use a neck brace to hold it up. My condition was grave to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was a speech-language pathologist unable to communicate verbally.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vanessa Abraham, a 45-year-old mother, had spent over 15 years helping children overcome speech obstacles and teaching them how to talk when one day, she lost her own voice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some believed she was suffering from the central nervous system disorder multiple sclerosis, others thought she had neuromyelitis optica (a rare autoimmune disorder that also affects the CNS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she would go a year without a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that didn't stop her from healing. She told DailyMail.com she fought as hard as she could for her four-year-old daughter, scared she would never be able to speak to the little girl again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I was unable to move myself in bed, unable to use the restroom, was tube fed via g-tube and intubated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was a speech-language pathologist unable to communicate verbally... so I had to rely on things like eye gaze and movements, letters on an alphabet board or paper to type on and text to speech app on my phone.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, she required a tracheostomy, which creates an opening in the windpipe to insert a tube to help oxygen reach the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, she also required a passy muir valve (PMV) for communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A PMV is a speaking valve designed to facilitate communication for people with tracheostomies or those on ventilators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It redirects airflow through the vocal cords, mouth, and nose, enabling speech and improving communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As her condition worsened, experts continued to look for answers, but came up empty. Despite this, Mrs Abraham began intensive 'natural' rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the website: 'For my recovery, I took the most natural approaches I could find. I did acupuncture, cranial sacral therapy, chiropractic treatments, endermologie [massage with a device that promotes blood circulation], stretch therapy and lasers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I completely avoided any prescription medications to address pain. However, I did do monthly infusions of IVIG [antibodies] per my neurologists recommendation as there was no way possible I would experience any medical complications or side effects from this form of medication.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also worked with another speech pathologist in the ICU, as well as during rehab to regain her voice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As months went by, she started to &lt;span&gt;slowly relearn how to swallow, speak and move and was eventually sent home - still without a diagnosis - and was told to see a neurologist in hopes of finding answers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I was unable to move myself in bed, unable to use the restroom, was tube fed via g-tube and intubated. Eventually I required a tracheostomy and utilized a passy muir valve (PMV) for communication,' she told DailyMail.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She claims that her greatest motivation was her then-four-year-old daughter whom she feared she would never speak to again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then by June 2019, Mrs Abraham visited a new neurologist at the University of California in San Diego who recognized her symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: 'It was not until a few months after exiting the hospital environment that they finally diagnosed me. It was only because I saw a new neurologist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'That neurologist was able to diagnose me in a few minutes based off what I was presenting with [cervical, brachial, pharyngeal paralysis]. She said she had seen this before in her career and was very confident I had the PCB-Variant of GB.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mrs Abraham was diagnosed with pharyngeal-cervical-brachial (PCB) variant, a rare form of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;GBS is a rare neurological disorder in which the patient's immune system mistakenly attacks part of their peripheral nerves, responsible for sending information from the brain to different body parts and back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The condition typically starts to spread from the feet and legs and travels to the arms and face. However in Mrs Abraham's case, it began in her face and then went down her body - making it difficult for doctors to diagnose her. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She told DailyMail.com: 'In the ICU they tested me for GBS but quickly dismissed it because my variant took a different course to paralysis. Typical variants ascend from the feet up, and mine took the opposite - it went top down (head to feet).'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The PCB variant of GBS causes rapid weakness in muscles of the mouth and throat, cervical spine in the neck and nerves in the shoulder.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It also causes a complete absence of reflexes in the upper limbs and arms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Significant weakness in the mouth and throat can make it difficult to talk, swallow, chew and breathe. It can also cause a person to slur their speech, drool out of the mouth and lead to facial paralysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weakness in the neck and shoulder make it hard to hold the head up and nerve problems - all symptoms Mrs Abraham was experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As months went by, she started to slowly relearn how to swallow, speak and move &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Abraham pictured here with her husband as she spent time in rehab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to BMJ Journals, most neurologists are unfamiliar with the PCB variant and often misdiagnose it as brainstem stroke, myasthenia gravis (a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease causing muscle weakness and fatigue) or botulism (fatal poisoning and paralysis caused by a bacteria). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The causes of both GBS and its variants remain unknown, though they are believed to be triggered by an immune system response to an infection. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13100755/Largest-Covid-vaccine-study-finds-shots-linked-small-increased-risk-neurological-blood-heart-disorders-extremely-rare.html"&gt;GBS has also been linked to the Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GBS is diagnosed in about one in 78,000 people each year around the world. About one in 100,000 people are affected in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no known cure for GBS or any of its variants, therapies such as plasma exchange and immunoglobulin injections (proteins that your immune system naturally makes to attack invading organisms) can help alleviate symptoms and reduce recovery time if started within two weeks of developing GBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most people eventually recover from even the most severe cases of GBS and healthcare professionals tend to transfer patients to rehabilitation settings to improve. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, six years on from her life-changing diagnosis, Mrs Abraham, who is now able to speak clearly and walk, said: '&lt;span&gt;Recovery was awful, long and required a lot of mental health services to address severe depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I was unable to drive for nine months and eat for six. I didn't work for a year. I had a lot of pain and discomfort and exhaustion. I napped daily and spent a lot of time in outpatient rehab, at the gym, resting, and in therapy for depression.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also revealed how she managed to interacte with people while re-learning how to speak: 'I communicated with a passy muir valve that is a device that is used with a tracheostomy. It was the most exhausting, scary and difficult procedure I have ever been through in my entire life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Due to the nature of my disease, it made talking again hard. I had an extremely high level of secretions that would require a lot of suctioning in order to use the PMV and talk again. It was physically exhausting. The first time I used the PMV I was able to only use it for less than a minute because it was so hard. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Before the PMV I used every other modality as an SLP I could think of to talk. I pointed to pictures, typed on the letter board and when severe and unable to move anything in my body I used eye gaze.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Six years on from her life-changing diagnosis, Mrs Abraham is now able to speak clearly &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her recovery, Mrs Abraham told DailyMail.com that her illness forever changed her life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: '&lt;span&gt;I lost myself. I lost who I once was and had to say goodbye to many dreams for my future. I was profoundly depressed and missed myself and wanted to be the mom I envisioned I would be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I am not as active as I once was. I was once able to run, hike mountains for miles and ride bikes and participate in yoga classes. I have had to stop doing all of that because I am simply not strong enough and cannot perform these tasks safely. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Being tube fed was depressing and isolating. I was no longer able to sit at the table and eat with my family. That is isolating. I was no longer able to work. I lost my identify as not only a mom and wife but also a SLP/working mom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I no longer felt I fit into the world I once was an active participant in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for life now, she told DailyMail.com she still struggles - both physically and mentally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said: 'I am six years out and still participate in weekly ICU support groups for PICS [post intensive care syndrome]. I am unable to sleep through the night without anxiety attacks - I have insomnia.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, she is trying to move forward and raising her daughter, running a neurological rehab business called A Neu Healing where she helps patients recovery from neurological impairments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the end, Mrs Abrahams said: 'Surround yourself with people that "get it" and with that I mean that people you can connect with, that understand what you are going through. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'People that understand the grief, loss, depression and anxiety you are feeling through difficult times. For me, I found that through ICU support groups for Post Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) and through the support of prayer warriors around the United States that experienced tragedy like mine.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Of course, there are lots of ways to improve your gut health, and some exciting new research is now suggesting that adding a very specific type of juice to your morning routine could help boost your gut health by tamping down gut inflammation. For the roughly 60 million Americans who struggle with gastrointestinal diseases, these findings could even prove life-changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the study found, plus what gastroenterologists want you to keep in mind when interpreting the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ashkan Farhadi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA; &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ellen Stein,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ellen Stein,&lt;/a&gt; MD, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/15/2/306" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, focused on patients with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a37144670/ulcerative-colitis-counting-macros-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ulcerative colitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ulcerative colitis&lt;/a&gt;, a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder that causes stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers randomly assigned 35 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 to take either a 130 milliliter tart cherry drink made with 100 milliliters of water and 30 milliliters of concentrated &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a60329891/tart-cherry-juice-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tart cherry juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tart cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; or a placebo drink (that had a similar look and taste) twice a day for six weeks. The participants continued to take their usual ulcerative colitis medications during this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took a bunch of measurements during the study, including looking at the participants’ physical and mental health, and ulcerative colitis symptoms. The participants also gave regular blood and stool samples, and kept food diaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that people in the tart cherry drink group had a 40 percent reduction in calprotectin, a protein that’s released when there’s inflammation in the gut. Participants in the tart cherry drink group also reported a 9 percent improvement in their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This trial indicates that twice-daily tart cherry supplementation can improve irritable bowel disorder-related quality of life as well as the severity of symptoms and therefore may be important in the management of ulcerative colitis,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does an inflamed gut affect your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut inflammation causes more than just intestinal discomfort, says &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ellen Stein,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ellen Stein,&lt;/a&gt; MD, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, it can cause lots of issues with your overall health, including joint pain, feeling tired or fatigued, dysbiosis [an imbalance of gut bacteria], or malabsorption, she says. It can also lead to worse symptoms of lactose intolerance or fructan sensitivity, Dr. Stein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treating the underlying cause of the disease is important— avoiding gluten for Celiac disease patients, calming inflammation with medication for irritable bowel disease patients, and eating a healthy diet and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics for those with gut [imbalance],” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, it’s really important to take care of your gut, says &lt;a href="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ashkan Farhadi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. “When the gut is inflamed, there’s a lot of inflammation throughout the body,” he says. “It causes a lot of trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does tart cherry juice help reduce inflammation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to point out that this study was only done on a small group of people, and it was also funded by the Cherry Marketing Institute, a non-profit group that represents American cherries. (However, the organization didn’t influence the design of the study or the results.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a few theories on why this drink may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tart cherries have polyphenols, which are naturally occurring plant compounds that act as antioxidants, and which may help tamp down on inflammation, Dr. Stein says. “Some other theories suggest that there is a prebiotic effect of this substance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can also just take these findings at face value, because there is a lot of information to show that the juice reduces inflammation in the group that took it compared to the placebo,” Dr. Farhadi says. “But we really have to take this with a grain of salt because there were only a few participants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stein stresses that, at this point, more data is needed to prove this connection, since most studies on tart cherry juice are small and results have been mixed. “There is nothing truly convincing that this particular food is the key to all health,” she says. “That said, it probably tastes good and in moderation is a healthy food to consume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much would I have to drink to see the positive effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much. This particular study had people drink 130 milliliters of a tart cherry drink twice a day, which is a little less than 4.5 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to reduce gut inflammation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research into the potential impact of tart cherry juice on the gut is ongoing, doctors say there are a few things you can do to lower levels of inflammation in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stein suggests having a regular exercise routine, eating a healthy diet with fiber from natural sources, getting plenty of good quality sleep, trying to reduce chronic stress, and focusing on your overall health. “Eating a balanced diet with healthy foods and less processed foods also seems to help, like the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a60617751/mediterranean-diet-lowers-hypertension-risk-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:23:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9kNlplS09tQTFmaEI3bzdJNXJrMU1LWENPODQzWTR3NFdwWERHWU9TZFZKQW5zNU1RMDFVR3BFLXBxdm1FQzA3eUhrQVBUUGRQUHNRWnNaUFd3RWsxZV9UbGRSVlRPaUxzTEl2Nk9TclRXU2tZRF9BYU5LcU84QQ</guid></item><item><title>根据最新研究，高纤维饮食可以挽救您的生命- SciTechDaily | A High-Fiber Diet Could Save Your Life, According to New Study - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQNXo0QjhFanFuRnNXSnNMcThoMGxLUDNpX2hLcnJjaXdTYzFEdmQtMlNZM1UtY0Z4Uy1NTW14UmI1dnVjYmtZRVhSeTlwNEpzMHlfRTFjT1NseldlWWIzVk9nQ0xiMjVjdFRZem1kYXdPMk9GRW9zdEgxbUJMZXBfeVl2LUQ1eVlHTkdTWHZXc3g?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 16:15:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQNXo0QjhFanFuRnNXSnNMcThoMGxLUDNpX2hLcnJjaXdTYzFEdmQtMlNZM1UtY0Z4Uy1NTW14UmI1dnVjYmtZRVhSeTlwNEpzMHlfRTFjT1NseldlWWIzVk9nQ0xiMjVjdFRZem1kYXdPMk9GRW9zdEgxbUJMZXBfeVl2LUQ1eVlHTkdTWHZXc3g</guid></item><item><title>新的电池技术可同时发电和净化废水- The Daily Galaxy | New Battery Tech Makes Power and Cleans Wastewater at the Same Time - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE0tdmprRF90YU1DUkNYdXlOb3NrdS1ZQzVJaF9Wc1VUTFlUczh2d1hrY3hhVS1BOEEwMVk2bFRJd1VJUmpwQ0lEZUNLRlVfQzBJbjJmbmpKUXBFZUVfdE5BcFZ1TlJGRGRSUnlYQS1JMjl6Um9QVVJnVmhmcVV4SGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;a href="https://iisc.ac.in/events/using-batteries-to-produce-hydrogen-peroxide-from-air-for-industrial-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Indian Institute of Science (IISc) &lt;/a&gt;have introduced an unexpected innovation that could transform both &lt;strong&gt;energy storage&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;industrial pollution treatment&lt;/strong&gt;. Published in the journal&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652622012719" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; ACS Applied Materials &amp;amp; Interfaces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, their new technique uses &lt;strong&gt;zinc-air battery technology&lt;/strong&gt; to produce &lt;strong&gt;hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)&lt;/strong&gt; in a way that is cleaner, cheaper, and potentially scalable — all while tackling toxic dyes from the textile industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dual-purpose Battery Technology With Clean Production Potential&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zinc-air batteries have long been studied for their promise as &lt;strong&gt;low-cost, energy-dense alternatives&lt;/strong&gt; to lithium-ion systems. They rely on &lt;strong&gt;zinc metal&lt;/strong&gt; as the anode and &lt;strong&gt;ambient air&lt;/strong&gt; as the cathode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this new study, IISc scientists have reengineered the zinc-air battery to not just store power, but also to &lt;strong&gt;generate hydrogen peroxide&lt;/strong&gt; as a &lt;strong&gt;byproduct of its discharge cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The battery’s operation induces a &lt;strong&gt;reduction reaction at the cathode&lt;/strong&gt;, converting oxygen into H₂O₂ rather than simply &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/They-Were-Cleaning-Dirty-Water%E2%80%94What-They-Found-Could-Power-the-Future.jpg" data-type="attachment" data-id="83675" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1210948600" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="86776"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. This feat, however, requires precise control of the chemical pathway — something the team achieved by integrating a &lt;strong&gt;metal-free, chemically modified carbon catalyst&lt;/strong&gt; into the system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike traditional H₂O₂ manufacturing processes, which demand &lt;strong&gt;high energy input&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;precious metal catalysts&lt;/strong&gt;, this method offers a low-cost, metal-free alternative with significant emissions reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Hydrogen Peroxide as a Weapon Against Toxic Industrial Dyes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because hydrogen peroxide is colorless, they added &lt;strong&gt;toxic synthetic dyes&lt;/strong&gt; (commonly found in textile effluents) to the mix. When the peroxide is generated, it interacts with these dyes, causing a visible&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/color-might-love-doesnt-exist/"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;color change&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and simultaneously &lt;strong&gt;breaking down the pollutants&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over time, this results in the &lt;strong&gt;complete degradation of color and toxicity&lt;/strong&gt;, showcasing a new approach to &lt;strong&gt;industrial wastewater treatment&lt;/strong&gt; using an &lt;strong&gt;energy storage system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doctoral researcher Asutosh Behera, lead author of the study, highlighted this &lt;strong&gt;dual-use concept&lt;/strong&gt;: generating a disinfectant and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/is-air-pollution-blocking-the-sun/"&gt;degrading pollutants &lt;/a&gt;in a single, integrated process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The H2O2 generated will further decompose into various radicals (such as hydroxide and superoxide) — highly raw, reactive organic species — that will eventually degrade the textile dye,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Clean Leap Forward From Traditional H₂o₂ Production&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, producing hydrogen peroxide involves the &lt;strong&gt;anthraquinone process&lt;/strong&gt;, an energy-intensive method that consumes fossil fuels and emits carbon dioxide. It also depends on &lt;strong&gt;rare and expensive metals&lt;/strong&gt; like palladium or platinum as catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The IISc breakthrough bypasses these issues entirely. Using &lt;strong&gt;abundant zinc&lt;/strong&gt; (especially plentiful in India) and &lt;strong&gt;ambient oxygen&lt;/strong&gt;, the new method leverages &lt;strong&gt;chemical energy in batteries&lt;/strong&gt; to drive H₂O₂ production. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Professor Aninda J. Bhattacharyya, the study’s corresponding author, this makes the approach not only &lt;strong&gt;environmentally sustainable&lt;/strong&gt;, but also &lt;strong&gt;economically viable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This method is very sustainable, low-cost, and highly energy-efficient,” Bhattacharyya stated in the institute’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;This Battery Might Power Your Home — And Clean Your Water&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study sits at the intersection of &lt;strong&gt;energy innovation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;green chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;environmental remediation&lt;/strong&gt;. It opens the door to energy systems that are &lt;strong&gt;multifunctional&lt;/strong&gt; — capable not just of storing electricity, but also of &lt;strong&gt;performing useful chemical reactions&lt;/strong&gt; as part of their operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In rural or off-grid locations, such a system could simultaneously provide power and clean water. Hydrogen peroxide also serves in medical sterilization, wastewater purification, and textile processing, making this innovation potentially valuable across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also contributes to the global trend of &lt;strong&gt;rethinking battery chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers are revisiting older technologies — from &lt;strong&gt;iron-alkaline batteries&lt;/strong&gt; once championed by Thomas Edison to &lt;strong&gt;hydrogen-generating nickel cells&lt;/strong&gt; — and uncovering ways to repurpose byproducts once seen as problems into &lt;strong&gt;secondary outputs&lt;/strong&gt; for other industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

"Shaken baby syndrome is 100% preventable. Background shows that there's no demographics that it doesn't affect. It is purely done out of anger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodily saw her life changed through shaken baby syndrome in December 1997, when her son, Elijah Fisher, was shaken and killed by his father. Bodily's story came to light after she made known in Elijah's obituary how he died and some local news organizations reached out in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Emily Bodily and her son Elijah are shown in this undated photo. A symbolic ribbon cutting marked the celebration of the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome’s 25th anniversary as an organization on Tuesday in Farmington. (Photo: National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last thing that I wanted was to explain over and over again, so it was just common sense to me to put how he died," Bodily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, she ended up sharing her story with the world as the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome later produced a documentary entitled Elijah's Story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that I was never prepared for something positive to come out of something so negative," Bodily said. "I am so happy to be able to be fighting against all of this and be able to have that chance to not let Elijah's voice die and be out there preventing this type of abuse until we can completely diminish it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still a lot of work to be done. National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome Executive Director Danielle Velazquez said the organization has been monitoring cases in Utah with publicly available data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have increased substantially over the last few years," Velazquez explained. "A lot of times it's fathers, it's mothers, boyfriends, daycare providers … And every single story is related to frustration with infants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome's main messages focus on what it calls &lt;a href="https://store.dontshake.org/category-s/108.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;the Period of PURPLE Crying&lt;/a&gt;, which begins around 2 months. The program is shared with hospitals and other health and childcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the only evidence-based shaken baby center prevention program in the world that can actually show a reduction in cases by about 35% of shaking and 30% of infant physical abuse," Velasquez explained. "Our materials are provided to those new families after the birth of their new baby by those healthcare providers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="divbox"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for parents and caregivers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try calming a crying baby by swaddling in a blanket or holding baby against your bare skin

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer a pacifier, rock gently and sing or talking softly

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If possible, try taking a walk with stroller or going for drive in the car

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are getting upset, focus on calming yourself down. Parenting is hard work! It's OK to ask for help

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put the baby in a safe place and walk away to calm down. Continue to check on the baby every five to 10 minutes

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider calling a friend, relative, neighbor, parent helpline, or your child's healthcare provider for support

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call the doctor if you think the child is sick

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never leave your baby alone with a person who is easily irritated, has a temper, or a history of violence

			&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood has historically been overlooked in research – considered only to be a &lt;a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjsrh/2021/11/18/menstrual-blood-no-longer-just-a-waste-product/"&gt;waste product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But menstrual blood actually has a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266657192400032X"&gt;rich cellular and molecular makeup&lt;/a&gt;. It contains immune cells, stems cells and endometrial cells – as well as metabolites such as proteins and lipids (fat). This makes menstrual blood a potential goldmine for insights into many different health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be a less invasive way for researchers to access important biological material without the need for surgical biopsies or other invasive techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its important composition, researchers are now using menstrual blood to investigate whether it can be used to uncover the causes of a disease, identify signs of a health condition and develop personalized treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where menstrual blood could be integral is research investigating  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/endometriosis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73093" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;. This condition causes endometrial tissue (which normally lines the uterus) to grow outside of the womb and on other organs, such as the bowel and ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research into endometriosis is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-01475-2/index.html"&gt;severely underfunded&lt;/a&gt;, despite it affecting &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/endometriosis"&gt;10 percent of women&lt;/a&gt;. It's also difficult to understand the mechanisms behind the disease without using invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, current treatment options – which include surgical lesion removal, hormonal contraceptives and pain relief – fail to address the root cause or associated complications (such as infertility).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some researchers have managed to develop  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-an-organoid" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="106655" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;organoids&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02194-y"&gt;using the endometrial cells from menstrual blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organoids are miniature, lab-grown 3D models of organs derived from the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; found in the blood. These organoids can mimic what happens in the actual endometrium (the innermost lining of the uterus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives researchers a non-invasive way to investigate the health status of the endometrium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By developing organoids from the menstrual blood of those suffering with endometriosis, researchers are able to model the disease in the lab. This may one day lead the way to better understanding the underlying mechanisms of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is also considered to be an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8836207/"&gt;inflammatory condition&lt;/a&gt;. This is because there's an over-activation of the immune system seen in people with endometriosis, which worsens symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, an area of high interest for research into endometriosis is the study of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood contains &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24249743/"&gt;live immune cells&lt;/a&gt; which have come from the reproductive tract. These immune cells offer insight into the inflammation that's occurring in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may help researchers better understand and develop treatments for painful sex, a common symptom for people with endometriosis which is &lt;a href="https://www.endofound.org/painful-sex-dyspareunia"&gt;linked to inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the presence of endometrial cells makes it an ideal tool for studying endometriosis, menstrual blood is also being used to offer insights into other reproductive diseases. For example, it has unveiled immune differences in patients with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35560014/"&gt;recurrent pregnancy loss&lt;/a&gt; that was not previously detectable using blood from the vein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stem cell research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9580754/"&gt;contains stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it an important resource for research into a variety of other health conditions – including those involved in critical processes such as &lt;a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5876-5-57"&gt;cardiovascular function, respiration and nervous system function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells are defined by their naive status and ability to become a new, specialized type of cell under the right conditions. Adult stem cells are usually taken from umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, bone marrow or fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it requires invasive techniques to extract a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; sample from these areas – and only small amounts can be acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But menstrual blood, a fluid which is typically produced monthly, has been found to contain &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9580754/"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; that are also capable of differentiating into various other cell types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly exciting as menstrual blood is readily available, naturally regenerates and collecting it does not require any surgical procedures or discomfort. This makes it a convenient and ethical option for stem cell research and potential therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158631" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158631" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor.jpg" alt="This Overlooked Waste Product Is Proving Useful For Medical Research" class="size-full wp-image-158631" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BloodSugarGlucoseMonitor-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158631" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Menstrual blood is even being used to monitor blood sugar levels. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEXEmmlehs/"&gt;Nataliya Vaitkevich/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from using these menstrual blood-derived stem cells to investigate reproductive diseases such as &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/molehr/article/20/9/905/2459769?login=true"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, there are also several studies looking at using these cells in other applications. For example, researchers have used them to investigate techniques for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30656863/"&gt;promoting wound healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/scd.2013.0390"&gt;improving blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="158338" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of diabetes, menstrual blood is also being used for a proof-of-concept study to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34759003/"&gt;monitor glycaemic control&lt;/a&gt;. This offers alternatives to traditional blood tests – such as &lt;a href="https://qvin.com/"&gt;the Q pad&lt;/a&gt;, a pad which contains a removable collection strip for blood testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other diseases which are showing promising results in being diagnosed through menstrual blood include &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9377370/"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11427561/"&gt;chlamydia&lt;/a&gt; and diseases associated with &lt;a href="https://sciforschenonline.org/journals/clinical-laboratory-medicine/JCLM130.php"&gt;lipid levels&lt;/a&gt; – such as atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The new normal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual blood is gaining traction in research due to its novelty and because it's a less invasive way to collect different cells and molecules for testing. It's easily accessible as a monthly "waste" product, and allows women to collect samples themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could bypass the need for doctors and nurses and the inconvenience of appointments if it becomes a more reliable diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite its promise, there are practical challenges that researchers face. Discussion around menstrual blood is still &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dirty-red-how-periods-have-been-stigmatised-through-history-to-the-modern-day-206967"&gt;sometimes seen as taboo&lt;/a&gt;. Some women may not feel comfortable handling their own blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also inconsistencies with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266657192400032X"&gt;how menstrual blood is collected&lt;/a&gt; between studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, studies which only required a smaller volume of menstrual blood have been able to make use of sanitary pads and tampons to collect samples. However, those which require a larger sample used menstrual cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue with this is that the products used have different compositions, which can interfere with the reliability of the results. Another issue lies predominantly with menstrual cups and the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11205264/"&gt;lack of knowledge&lt;/a&gt; surrounding their proper use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, addressing stigma and promoting awareness around menstrual blood research is vital. While it has historically been overlooked, menstrual blood must now be recognized as a powerful, non-invasive tool in advancing research.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253384/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Hess&lt;/a&gt;, MD, Dean at the Medical College of Georgia and a neurologist and stroke specialist, who was not involved in the study, explained that “One of the tests they use is a novel object recognition. So a smart mouse is going to explore a new object it’s never seen before… this is a very standardized test that we do in the lab to measure cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another test was the Morris water maze, which involved finding a hidden underwater platform based on previous tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After behavioral testing, researchers were able to examine the brain tissue of mice for further analysis, as well as vitamin K in the liver and kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Low vitamin K vs. regular diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, mice on the low vitamin K diet saw worse outcomes than mice who received a regular diet. For one thing, researchers found that male mice who had the low vitamin K diet had a decreased survival rate. They also had a lower weight gain than female control mice. Female mice on the low vitamin K diet did not experience these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers also found that mice on the low vitamin K diet had lower levels of Menaquinone-4 (MK4) in the brain. MK4 is the major form of vitamin K when it is present in the brain. There were also lower levels of vitamin K in the liver and kidneys of the mice on the low vitamin K diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the novel object recognition test, mice on the low vitamin K diet did not explore the novel object as much as the control mice. This implies these mice had problems with recognition memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice on the low vitamin K diet also took longer on the first three days of the Morris water maze learning how to locate the hidden platform. Over the four days, they also took longer than controls, but this level did not reach a level of statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also noted differences in the hippocampus area of the mice’s brains if they were on the low vitamin K diet. The mice with the low vitamin K diet had decreased neurogenesis in this brain area. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29678-2_3846" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Neurogenesis&lt;/a&gt; has to do with the body creating neurons that are mature and able to appropriately function. These findings suggest that vitamin K may affect neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hess explained the following to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In mice and in all mammals, we don’t make new neurons, usually throughout the brain. We make them in specific areas. So one area where they’re made, and this has actually also been shown in humans, is the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. So the hippocampus is the part of the brain that’s best associated with recent memory, which is affected very early in Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study authors speculate that vitamin K’s impact on hippocampal neurogenesis may then affect cognitive functions like learning and memory that are related to the work of the hippocampus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that mice on the low vitamin K diet had changes in specific cells called microglial cells in the hippocampus, which suggested the activation of these cells. These observations of the microglial cells indicated increased neuroinflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These results suggest that low vitamin K may induce an increase in neuroinflammation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors speculate that vitamin K might protect hippocampal neurogenesis in part through its anti-inflammatory effects. Vitamin K’s effects on cognition could also be somewhat related to how it affects inflammation and protects against oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research offers critical insight into the potential impact of vitamin K on learning and memory. However, it also has limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, mouse studies provide limited information on how low vitamin K affects brain function in people. The researchers also chose to focus on a specific form of vitamin K that is present in human diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also only had so many mice left for behavioral testing because of the higher death of male mice in the low vitamin K diet group. The authors acknowledge that the final endpoints of the study also did not have data from the male mice who died before the study was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors could have affected the observed results, too. For example, the authors note that vitamin K could be involved in metabolizing a cell membrane component called sphingolipids. They note that sphingolipids “contribute to proliferation, differentiation, and neuroinflammation.” They explain that more research is required to see if the changes to sphingolipids from low vitamin K are involved in neuroinflammation and hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also unable to measure proteins dependent on vitamin K in the brain and levels of an enzyme called γ-glutamyl carboxylase because of the limited amount of brain tissue and the experiments they ran. It’s possible these proteins were responsible for the observed effects of vitamin K, so more research is likely required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also unclear how the severity of impairment from vitamin K deficiency relates to the time frame of deficiency and mouse age.

For the first time, scientists have discovered tiny plastic particles in human ovarian follicular fluid, raising serious concerns about their impact on female fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing impact of plastic pollution on the human body is becoming increasingly evident, as tiny plastic particles, even thinner than a hair strand, silently infiltrate the brain, heart, lungs, and other vital organs, affecting their function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, researchers looked for microplastics in the follicular fluid of 18 women going through assisted reproductive treatment at a fertility clinic in Salerno, Italy, and found them in 14 samples. Here's the alarming impact of microplastics in human ovaries. Let's first understand what follicular fluid is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that microplastics pose a significant risk to women's reproductive health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is follicular fluid?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luigi Montano, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the University of Rome says the findings are 'very alarming', and also crucial in terms of understanding the impact of microplastic on women's reproductive systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montano's current findings are part of a larger project that also found microplastics in human urine and semen, and examined the impact on male fertility. The researcher said microplastics could be behind the declining sperm counts and a drop in sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact of microplastic on women's health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While men are more affected by the toxic effects of microplastics, the impact on women is no less. Animal research has linked microplastics to ovarian dysfunction and health problems, like reduced oocyte maturation, and a lower capacity for fertilization. It can also lead to alterations to ovarian tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montano said that bisphenol, phthalates, Pfas and other highly toxic chemicals that use microplastics as a “Trojan horse” to get into the body, and into the ovaries, are 'very dangerous'. They can disrupt hormones and harm women's reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Reproductive health risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics have been detected in human ovarian follicular fluid for the first time, raising concerns about their potential impact on female fertility. These particles could interfere with the development and maturation of eggs, affecting reproductive health and hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Hormonal disruption&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can mimic or interfere with the body’s hormones. In women, this can lead to imbalances in estrogen, progesterone, and other key hormones, potentially contributing to conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, and irregular menstrual cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Increased risk of inflammatory diseases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics, when absorbed into the bloodstream, may trigger inflammation throughout the body. Chronic inflammation is linked to a variety of health issues, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular problems, and even certain cancers. Women may be more vulnerable due to differences in immune system responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Impact on pregnancy and fetal development&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to microplastics during pregnancy may have potential risks for both maternal and fetal health. The particles could cross the placenta, affecting fetal development and leading to complications such as low birth weight or developmental delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Respiratory and digestive issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inhalation and ingestion of microplastics can cause respiratory issues, such as irritation and inflammation in the lungs. Women, particularly those in urban environments, are at risk of developing chronic conditions like asthma or bronchitis due to continuous exposure. Similarly, ingestion may disrupt digestive health, leading to gastrointestinal discomfort or long-term issues like gut inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Microplastics and male fertility&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are formed due to breaking down or decomposition of plastic that leads to formation of numerous microplastics (MPs), less than 5 mm in diameter. They enter the soil, and ocean. They become part of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 15% of couples worldwide face &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9134445/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;infertility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, with nearly half of the cases linked to male factors. Male semen quality has significantly declined over the years. From 1940 to 1990, sperm concentration dropped from 113 million/ml to 66 million/ml. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also observed this decline, reducing the normal semen concentration value from 60 million/ml in 1980 to 15 million/ml in 2010, with little change in the latest 2021 guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline in sperm quality over the past 80 years coincides with the rise of plastic pollution. While other factors like obesity, diet, and environmental toxins may also play a role, plastic pollution remains a major persistent threat to male fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Covid-19 podcast: Closest known relatives of Covid virus found.

While most people know to cut down on salt when trying to control their blood pressure, a new study has revealed this might not actually be the best plan of action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Anita Layton of the University of Waterloo said: “Our research suggests that adding more potassium-rich foods to your diet, such as bananas or broccoli, might have a greater positive impact on your blood pressure than just cutting sodium.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the study claims managing high blood pressure could be as simple as comparing how much potassium and sodium we eat. Potassium is mostly commonly found in fruits like bananas, potatoes, spinach and avocados while sodium is in most fast food, pizza, bread and ready meals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajprenal.00222.2024" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;American Journal of Physiology Renal Physiology&lt;/a&gt;, the new research found that increasing your potassium intake helps your body cover and regulate after having sodium. Essentially, sodium increases your blood pressure and bananas can drop it, so combining both of these simple diet swaps could make some powerful changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers even claimed that looking at the sodium to potassium ratio of your diet could “be a stronger predictor for blood pressure, risk of cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality” than only focusing on one of these compounds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This also matches the current global trends. Western diets are often packed with sodium and are low in fruits and vegetables, where potassium would come in so our bodies aren't equipped to handle the amount of sodium we’re taking on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study explained: If your sodium intake and blood pressure is high but you increase the amount of potassium you eat, this could stabilise your blood pressure by washing out the excess sodium. Men were found to be more likely to have high blood pressure but also more likely to benefit from these dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Future research is expected to see how medications interact with this system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 14:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNNDNFcnQ5M0RGN3c0OGljNHRjNVRNOFFEM2dEWWYtblJ5WXF5N3huVFJnbTdPRnpWR1U0UzJ0UWRzVDRYdWRxYWktTnk3dGJyNVpUTy1LY0JZQktBMWtvSFZSUTFRcUp2SlJGVWhrdFoyMnhXeWpjQkFXNGtYSUF3X0w0LVNkM2pM</guid></item><item><title>致癌砷在世界大米中积聚- Gizmodo | Cancer-Causing Arsenic Is Building Up in the World’s Rice - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOVzlES1JSSTh4b2ktaXZhT05PalN1bS1NRXdmeTZlam1BTVVkS2dRMFpGUWtpZkdBc19pbFBmY2l2Mms3eEZ4YjlTYlhmXzFTbFdSLUNuakQ1NDlDSHc0X3I3TFBucDBfTi12MGk4SWpqdDdRekNTYzF0OXBZMlQ2d1dESk5kWWZrdElyQ0xrc2E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;

Sign up for Grist’s &lt;a title="Weekly newsletter" href="https://go.grist.org/signup/weekly/partner?utm_campaign=republish-content&amp;amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;amp;utm_source=partner"&gt;weekly newsletter here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Throughout the Yangtze River Delta, a region in southern China famed for its widespread rice production, farmers grow belts of slender green stalks. Before they reach several feet tall and turn golden brown, the grassy plants soak in muddy, waterlogged fields for months. Along the rows of submerged plants, levees store and distribute a steady supply of water that farmers source from nearby canals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;This traditional practice of flooding paddies to raise the notoriously thirsty crop is almost as old as the ancient grain’s domestication. Thousands of years later, the agricultural method continues to predominate in rice cultivation practices from the low-lying fields of Arkansas to the sprawling terraces of Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;As the planet heats up, this popular process of growing rice is becoming increasingly more dangerous for the millions of people worldwide that eat the grain regularly, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the journal Lancet Planetary Health. After drinking water, the researchers say, rice is the world’s second largest dietary source of inorganic arsenic, and climate change appears to be increasing the amount of the highly toxic chemical that is in it. If nothing is done to transform how most of the world’s rice is produced, regulate how much of it people consume, or mitigate warming, the authors conclude that communities with rice-heavy diets could begin confronting increased risks of cancer and disease as soon as 2050.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“Our results are very scary,” said Donming Wang, the ecological doctorate student at the Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences who led the paper. “It’s a disaster … and a wake-up call.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Back in 2014, Wang and an international team of climate, plant, and public health scientists started working together on a research project that would end up taking them close to a decade to complete. Wading through rice paddies across the Yangtze Delta, they sought to find out just how projected temperatures and levels of atmospheric CO2 in 2050 would interact with the arsenic in the soil and the rice crops planted there. They knew, from past research, that the carcinogen was a problem in rice crops, but wanted to find out how much more of an issue it might be in a warming world. The team didn’t look at just any rice, but some of the grain varieties most produced and consumed worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Although there are &lt;a href="https://www.riceassociation.org.uk/types-of-rice"&gt;an estimated 40,000 types of rice&lt;/a&gt; on the planet, they tend to be grouped into three categories based on length of the grain. Short-grain rice, or the sticky kind often used in sushi; long-grain, which includes aromatic types like basmati and jasmine; and medium-grain, or rice that tends to be &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/types-of-rice?srsltid=AfmBOop6Nx25mqFpHopqAD6gC-ZdLve2kvlZ8nEYym0Dfl8RwLT2cIxb"&gt;served as a main dish&lt;/a&gt;. Of these, the short-to-medium japonica and long-grain indica are the &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.857896/full"&gt;two major subspecies of cultivated rice&lt;/a&gt; eaten across Asia. Wang’s study modelled the growth of 28 varieties of japonica, indica, and hybrid rice strains central to cuisine for seven of the continent’s top rice consuming and producing countries: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam. India, Vietnam, and China are among the group of &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/rice/trade#:~:text=Despite%20its%20current%20export%20restrictions,of%20annual%20global%20rice%20exports."&gt;eight nations&lt;/a&gt; that lead the rest of the world in rice exports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;After nearly a decade of observing and analyzing the growth of the plants, the researchers discovered that the combination of higher temperatures and CO2 encourages root growth, increasing the ability of rice plants to uptake arsenic from the soil. They believe this is because climate-related changes in soil chemistry that favor arsenic can be more easily absorbed into the grain. Carbon-dioxide enriched crops were found to capture more atmospheric carbon and pump some of that into the soil, stimulating microbes that are making arsenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;The more root growth, the more carbon in the soil, which can be a source of food for soil bacteria that multiply under warming temperatures. When soil in a rice paddy is waterlogged, oxygen gets depleted, causing the soil bacteria to rely further on arsenic to generate energy. The end result is more arsenic building up in the rice paddy, and more roots to take it up to the developing grain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;These arsenic-accumulating effects linked to increased root growth and carbon capture is a paradoxical surprise to Corey Lesk, a Dartmouth College postdoctoral climate and crop researcher unaffiliated with the paper. The paradox, said Lesk, is that both of these outcomes have been talked about as potential benefits to rice yields under climate change. “More roots could make the rice more drought-resistant, and cheaper carbon can boost yields generally,” he said. “But the extra arsenic accumulation could make it hard to realize health benefits from that yield boost.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Arsenic comes in many different forms. Notoriously toxic, inorganic arsenic — compounds of the element that don’t contain carbon — is what the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/arsenic"&gt;classifies&lt;/a&gt; as a “confirmed carcinogen” and “the most significant chemical contaminant in drinking water globally.” Such forms of arsenic are &lt;a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/toxmetal/arsenic/the-facts-on-arsenic/"&gt;typically more toxic&lt;/a&gt; to humans because they are less stable than their organic counterparts and may allow arsenic to interact with molecules that ramp up exposure. Chronic exposure has been linked to lung, bladder, and skin cancers, as well as heart disease, diabetes, adverse pregnancy, neurodevelopmental issues, and weakened immune systems, among other health impacts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Scientists and public-health specialists have known for years that the presence of arsenic in food is a mounting threat, but dietary exposure has long been considered much less of a risk in comparison to contaminated groundwater. So policy measures to mitigate the risk have been slow going. The few existing standards that have been enacted by the European Union and China, for example, are considered inconsistent and largely unenforced. No country has formally established regulations for organic arsenic exposure in foods. (In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has established &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/chemical-metals-natural-toxins-pesticides-guidance-documents-regulations/supporting-document-action-level-inorganic-arsenic-rice-cereals-infants"&gt;an action level of 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic in infant rice cereal&lt;/a&gt;, but that recommendation for manufacturers isn’t an enforceable regulation on arsenic in rice or any other food.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Wang hopes to see this change. The levels of inorganic arsenic commonly found in rice today fall within China’s recommended standards, for example, but her paper shows that lifetime bladder and lung cancer incidences are likely to increase “proportionally” to exposure by 2050. Under a “worst case” climate scenario, where global temperatures rise above 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and are coupled with CO2 levels that increase another &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/humans-didnt-exist-the-last-time-there-was-this-much-co2-in-the-air/"&gt;200 parts per million&lt;/a&gt;, the levels of inorganic arsenic in the rice varieties studied are projected to surge by a whopping 44 percent. That means that more than half the rice samples would exceed China’s current proposed limit, which limits 200 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic in paddy rice, with an estimated 13.4 million cancers linked to rice-based arsenic exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Because these health risks are in part calculated based on body weight, infants and young children will face the biggest health burdens. Babies, in particular, may end up facing outsize risks through the consumption of rice cereals, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“You’re talking about a crop staple that feeds billions of people, and when you consider that more carbon dioxide and warmer temperatures can significantly influence the amount of arsenic in that staple, the amount of health consequences related to that are, for lack of a better word, enormous,” said study coauthor Lewis Ziska, a plant biologist researching climate change and public health at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;But everyone should not suddenly stop eating rice as a result, he added. Though the team found the amount of inorganic arsenic in rice is higher than a lot of other plants, it’s still quite low overall. The key variable is how much rice a person eats. If you are among the bulk of the world that consumes rice multiple times a week, this looming health burden could apply to you, but if you do so more sporadically, Ziska says, the inorganic arsenic you may end up exposed to won’t be “a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;In that way, the study’s projections may also deepen existing global and social inequities, as a big reason rice has long reigned as one of the planet’s most devoured grains is because it’s also among the most affordable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Beyond mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions — what Ziska calls “waving my rainbows, unicorns, and sprinkles wand” — adaptation efforts to avoid a future with toxic rice include rice paddy farmers planting earlier in the season to avoid seeds developing under warmer temperatures, better soil management, and plant breeding to minimize rice’s propensity to accumulate so much arsenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Water-saving irrigation techniques such as alternate wetting and drying, where paddy fields are first flooded and then allowed to dry in a cycle, could also be used to reduce these increasing health risks &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the grain’s enormous methane footprint. On a global scale, rice production accounts for roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/20/climate/rice-farming-climate-change.html"&gt;8 percent of all methane emissions from human activity&lt;/a&gt; — flooded paddy fields are ideal conditions for &lt;a href="https://climateandhealthalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MethaneReport-Ag-FINAL.pdf"&gt;methane-emitting bacteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“This is an area that I know is not sexy, that doesn’t have the same vibe as the end of the world, rising sea levels, category 10 storms,” said Ziska. “But I will tell you quite honestly that it will have the greatest effect in terms of humanity, because we all eat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://grist.org/"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/"&gt;https://grist.org/food-and-agriculture/the-king-of-poisons-arsenic-is-building-up-in-rice/&lt;/a&gt;.
