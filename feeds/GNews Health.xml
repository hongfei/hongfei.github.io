&lt;p&gt;I had a double mastectomy when I was 40 years old in 1997. I was married and had two children under the age of 11. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting off my breasts when I didn’t have cancer seemed radical, but it wasn’t radical to me. I have the BRCA1 gene mutation. That means I have a 60% chance of getting ovarian cancer and an 85% chance of getting breast cancer ― the deadly kind that doesn’t respond to treatment. For me, those odds felt like 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before genetic testing was available, my mother got ovarian cancer when she was 62 and a few years later, she died. Then two of my cousins got breast cancer before they were 60 and both of them died. So, I got a prophylactic hysterectomy and a double mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I’m 64, and I know I made the right decision because I’m alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the surgery, I spoke to a few other women who had mastectomies. They told me how it hurt to lift their arms after the procedure and how it took months to stretch their skin to accommodate the implants used to make reconstructed breasts. None of that scared me. I knew that a cancer diagnosis, chemotherapy, and death were, of course, much worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I had the surgery and then took my son to his first day of kindergarten three days later with surgical drains hiding under an oversized shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask the plastic surgeon how my breasts would look after the reconstruction. I even thought they would look better, fuller, like they did before I nursed two babies. I was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My implants are nothing like the ones many women get to look and feel sexier. Mine, the kind you get when the surgeon scrapes every bit of breast tissue out, are right under the skin. The skin covering the implants is thin and taut, and cold to the touch ― a different temperature than the rest of my body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that breast reconstruction after a radical mastectomy is a difficult process. After the initial surgery, I had surgery six more times over the next 15 years to deal with the pain caused by scar tissue, and also to try to make my boobs look more normal. Three times, the plastic surgeons attached fake nipples made from skin taken from my pubic area, and they always fell off within a month of the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boobs were ugly, and I hated to let anyone see them. Even doctors couldn’t hide their disgust. When I went to the dermatologist once a year for a skin cancer screening, I reminded him about my mastectomies and reconstruction to avoid the slightest change in his facial expression, like I saw the last time he opened my paper gown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the surgery, I shut the door when I took a shower or turned away from my husband when I changed my clothes in front of him. I never asked him if he wanted to see or feel my boobs, nor did he ask. I kept my T-shirt on during sex for the remaining 12 years of our marriage, and we never talked about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my divorce and more reconstructive surgery, my breasts, now with tattooed nipples where the flesh ones should have been, looked better, but they still weren’t “normal.” They were too hard and too cold. When I started dating, it had been 30 years since I was with a man other than my husband. I was anxious about intimacy, about letting a man see or touch my over-50 body. But my breasts made me consider never dating again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I told the first man I dated how taking my shirt off made me uncomfortable, he said, “You never have to take your shirt off for me. We’ll play shirts and skins, like in a pickup basketball game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly, that’s what we did for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, when I started seeing David, I went over to his house for dinner. We were standing in his kitchen talking and sipping our drinks, a vodka cranberry for me, and a scotch for him. He looked at me and said, “I’m dying to kiss you,” and leaned in for the kiss. I kissed him back. It felt good. As the kissing got more passionate, we moved to the couch. A few minutes in, I pulled away and put my hand on his chest. &lt;/p&gt;

Fortunately, it is rare, but it can be very deadly," Dr. Alok Patel, ABC News medical contributor and pediatrician at Stanford Children's Health, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This bacteria normally exists in warm water, salty water, sometimes brackish water, especially during summer months," Dr. Patel explained. Brackish water occurs where fresh water meets salt water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The bacteria can infect people in two ways: through open wounds exposed to coastal waters or by eating raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters. Symptoms can range from stomach illness to severe wound infections, and in some cases, life-threatening blood poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If you come in contact with ocean water when you have cuts or eat raw seafood and you get sick, you want to make sure you see a doctor immediately, because this needs to be treated quickly," Patel warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health noted that certain people face higher risks, including those with liver disease, cancer, diabetes or weakened immune systems. About one in five people with severe infections died, sometimes within just days of becoming ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To stay safe, health officials recommended avoiding salt water if you have open wounds, thoroughly washing any cuts exposed to ocean water and being cautious with raw seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The ocean is dirty news.

Your body metabolizes the alcohol you drink into a chemical called acetaldehyde, which is classified as a carcinogen,' Dr Nishan Tchekmedyian, a hematologist and oncologist at City of Hope in Irvine, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-726ce7e0-6e34-11f0-b2bd-2165c94e8f3c" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Alcohol can also increase cancer recurrence in certain cases. For example, studies show that breast cancer survivors who drank more than three to four drinks per week were at a higher risk for recurrence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular pre-made canned cocktails make enjoying a drink easier than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The demand for alcoholic canned cocktails increased by 20 percent in 2023, and the drinks continue to gain popularity among those under the age of 45, according to a study by Veylinx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, doctors caution even if a beverage has &lt;span&gt;low alcohol by volume (ABV), the ingredients that come with the convenience - including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14843031/Startling-number-foods-drinks-contain-cancer-linked-ingredient-revealed-major-study.html"&gt;food dyes and preservatives&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;span&gt; can increase the risk of developing disease and neurological conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The National Institute of Health has found Yellow 5 to be contaminated with benzidine or other carcinogens&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are particularly concerned about colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under the age of 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14799325/addiction-cancer-Crave-book-smoking-alcohol-fast-food.html" class=""&gt;expected to die from colorectal cancer this year&lt;/a&gt;, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still a minority, experts remain concerned about increasing cases among younger people. Officials estimate 2,600 new cases among those under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Canned cocktails such as Smirnoff Ice Red White &amp;amp; Berry are known to contain Blue 1, Red 40 and sodium citrate as some of their primary ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 Toxicology Reports study conducted in mice found that Blue 1 dye can damage DNA and cause inflammation in the colon, potentially raising the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, previous studies have shown that consumption of Blue 1 can cause seizures, liver damage, thyroid damage and may contribute to the development of tumors in the bladder and stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The petroleum-based dye has also previously been associated with childhood behavioral problems, as well as infertility in adults.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blue 1, also known as Brilliant Blue FCF, is a synthetic water-soluble food dye derived from petroleum that is used in various food items, drugs and cosmetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dye - which is also a major ingredient in the Monaco Blue Crush canned cocktail - is known to cause allergic reactions and hyperactivity in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Canned cocktails such as Smirnoff Ice Red, White &amp;amp; Berry are known to contain Blue 1, Red 40 and sodium citrate as some of their primary ingredients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Red 40, or Allura Red AC, is made by extracting hydrocarbons from petroleum that are then processed with salts added to create a brilliant red color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Food companies use the ingredient to make their goods more appealing to consumers, with Red 40 being the most commonly used food dye in the US having been found in more than 36,000 products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But over recent decades, studies have suggested the coloring could be linked to hyperactivity, irritability and trouble focusing in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the FDA notes that there is not enough evidence to classify Red 40 as a risk to human health, the European Union restricted its use in 2010 and California and West Virginia have also approved bans on the coloring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/rfk-jr/index.html" id="mol-ec47ba10-6d6a-11f0-a65b-29defdbea910" class=""&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; has been cracking down on the use of Red 40 in all items across the country and is now ready to ban the dye, months after banning Red 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sodium citrate is used as a preservative in many foods and drinks to control acidity and prevent ingredients from separating - it adds a sour and salty flavor and also works as an emulsifier in cheese, preventing it from becoming greasy when melted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The preservative, found in both White Claw Hard Seltzer and Topo Chico Mango Hard Seltzer cans, has also been proven to promote the growth of cancerous tumors in the bladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Blue 1 is a major ingredient in the Monaco Blue Crush canned cocktail&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from this, experts are also warning against ready-to-drink beverages such as canned Aperol spritz, which contains Sunset Yellow FCF (an orange-yellow azo dye) and Ponceau 4R (a red azo dye). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both dyes have been proven to cause allergic skin reactions in sensitive people, such as rash, eczema or hives, and can also lead to shortness of breath and asthma-like attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Nishan Tchekmedyian, a hematologist and oncologist at City of Hope in Irvine, California&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While current evidence does not point to a significant cancer risk in adults, studies have shown that excessive consumption of Ponceau 4R can lead to neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe that the dye contains traces of aluminum, a metal that has been previously linked to promoting the development of &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-560e2f40-6e4e-11f0-b2bd-2165c94e8f3c" class=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson's disease in the brain, which can lead to dementia and loss of motor activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingesting aluminum in high quantities can also change the composition of bacteria in the digestive tract (the microbiome) and disrupt the immune system, leading to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has also found that Ponceau 4R can mimic the effects of estrogen in the women potentially affecting sexual function and leading to obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High estrogen levels can increase the risk of certain cancers, particularly breast and uterine cancers, as it can stimulate the excessive growth of cells in these organs, turning them cancerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another popular canned cocktail, especially with younger Americans, is BuzzBallz, which has&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nearly 30 grams of sugar per bottle and harmful dyes such as Yellow 5 and Blue 1, both of which have been linked to hyperactivity and neurological issues in multiple animal studies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sodium citrate is used as a preservative in many drinks including Topo Chico Mango Hard Seltzer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;BuzzBallz drinks are made of harmful dyes such as Yellow 5 and Blue 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I wouldn't recommend drinking BuzzBallz, not even occasionally,' Dr Michelle Routhenstein, a preventive cardiology dietitian, told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With 15 percent alcohol and nearly 30 grams of added sugar in a single serving, they pack an undesirable combination that can spike blood pressure and blood sugar, cause arrhythmias, strain the liver, promote fat buildup, and increase inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From a cardiovascular standpoint, these drinks pose unnecessary risk with no health benefit, and over time, they can negatively contribute to chronic conditions like heart disease, fatty liver and type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e68953a0-61c0-11f0-84e9-f11a28450733" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess sugar consumption on a regular basis can pave the way for weight gain, high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity, both of which are major risks for cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the American Heart Association, men should consume no more than 36 grams or 150 calories of sugar per day while women should consume no more than 25 grams or 100 calories of sugar per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Yellow 5, also known as tartrazine, is a synthetic food dye approved by the FDA for use in food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have linked the dye to hyperactivity in children and genotoxicity, meaning it can damage DNA and potentially lead to cancer in adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Institute of Health has also found Yellow 5 to be contaminated with benzidine and other carcinogens that can increase the risk of cancer development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has reached out Smirnoff, Monaco Blue, White Claw, Topo Chico and BuzzBallz for a comment, but has not heard back.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 22:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQYWJTb2lPaFFLejVoRjBnMi1pTWs4aW56bjdfa0w3UW9ySm02dU9sT0RwTmZWV1lfSnR0Q3lWMWFpSTJqNnVXRW1iaHRLZ0ppckNpX2dBaVFIaVdUMURnQkdzbHl3VmQ1NnhSazVtWDQ4RnJXTFlqdjBlbExSaEl3TlhCZ25mSUpYeWQtWEVNTmpxb052VldXLTJiejR1RHZnWENwazZsLTNVYzY3ZnlTM0xrZmFIN0ZnYjY5VkVfREJCQ2g3bHQyLVU1RVpPSk9VNW5BWmdGT2RCQQ</guid></item><item><title>对可能降低癌症治疗效果的常见甜味剂的警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common artificial sweetener loved by millions weakens the effects of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-47601180-6f15-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;University of Pittsburgh researchers discovered that sucralose, a zero-calorie sweetener, reduced immunotherapy effectiveness in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially developed in the 1970s for people with obesity and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-4760d4d0-6f15-11f0-b899-97c7884526fb" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to sweeten food while avoiding blood sugar spikes, sucralose, more &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14539329/Sugar-free-diet-foods-artificial-sweetener.html"&gt;commonly known as Splenda&lt;/a&gt;, has become ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s used in over 4,500 foods and drinks, including diet sodas and low-calorie foods. In the US, it accounts for 30 percent of the sweetener market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy, which boosts the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells, may reach for a diet soda or sugar-free baked good, believing they’re &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11950929/Youd-need-consume-75-packets-Splenda-DAY-suffer-health-problems-fear.html"&gt;making a healthy choice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sucralose kills some good bacteria that reside in the gut while allowing harmful strains to grow, impacting the body’s ability to digest foods and break down fiber, train immune cells to fight pathogens, make vitamins like folate and B12, produce serotonin, and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Dr Diwakar Davar, an oncologist and hematologist at UPMC, said in a statement: ‘We found that sucralose impeded the effectiveness of immunotherapies across a range of cancer types, stages and treatment modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These observations raise the possibility of designing prebiotics, such as targeted nutrient supplementation for patients who consume high levels of sucralose.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cancer patients on immunotherapy might choose diet drinks or sugar-free treats thinking they're healthier options (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team used mouse models, some with lung cancer and some with melanoma, to test how sucralose altered their microbiomes, finding that the sweetener disrupted the delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reduced key amino acids such as arginine, which are needed to fuel immune cells. It also led to dysfunctional CD8+ T cells, critical for fighting cancer, and blunted the effects of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, a class of cancer treatments that includes popular medicines Keytruda and Opdivo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Dr Abby Overacre, an immunology professor at Pitt and UPMC Hillman, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.upmc.com/media/news/073125-artificial-sweetner"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘When arginine levels were depleted due to sucralose-driven shifts in the microbiome, T cells couldn’t function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As a result, immunotherapy wasn’t as effective in mice that were fed sucralose.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To assess the relevance of these findings for humans, they questioned 132 advanced cancer patients, including 91 people with melanoma and 41 with lung cancer, about their sucralose intake, as well as 25 people at high risk of their melanoma recurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People reported drinking diet sodas, using the artificial sweetener in coffee and tea, and eating low-calorie snacks sweetened with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high amount of sucralose was considered anything above 0.16 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. For a 155-lb person, that’s less than a single packet of Splenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with melanoma and lung cancer who consumed at least that much sucralose had a 3.2 times higher risk of their cancer progressing faster, as well as less tumor shrinkage in response to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sucralose reduced immunotherapy effectiveness in various cancers regardless of type, stage, or treatment approach  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People at risk of melanoma recurrence who drank or ate at least that much sucralose had a higher risk of their cancer returning after surgery and immunotherapy and fewer signs of a strong immune response to tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experiments in mice revealed that disruption to the microbiome due to sucralose was the driving force behind alterations in their cancer-fighting T cells, which were starved of the crucial amino acid arginine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When scientists transplanted feces from sucralose-fed mice into untreated mice, the latter exhibited a similar poor immune response to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when scientists supplemented their low levels of arginine using the amino acid citrulline, commonly found in melons, pumpkins, and legumes, T cells regained their cancer-killing ability, reversed their resistance to immunotherapy, and their tumors shrank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/doi/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-25-0247/763776/Sucralose-consumption-ablates-cancer-immunotherapy"&gt;Cancer Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Overacre said: ‘It’s easy to say, “Stop drinking diet soda,” but when patients are being treated for cancer, they are already dealing with enough, so asking them to drastically alter their diet may not be realistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We need to meet patients where they are. That’s why it’s so exciting that arginine supplementation could be a simple approach to counteract the negative effects of sucralose on immunotherapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope to launch a clinical trial investigating whether citrulline supplements, which boost arginine levels more than arginine itself, affect the gut microbiome and anti-tumor immune response in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Instead, it only focuses on the amount of plaque in the body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scan is meant for those who have a family history of early coronary artery disease and have an intermediate risk for a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also advised to those who have a history of tobacco use, high cholesterol, diabetes or high blood pressure and those who are obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A coronary calcium scan is not recommended as a general screening test for those at a high risk for heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also not recommended to those who have already had an attack, have a heart stent or had coronary artery bypass graft surgery before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Based on the amount of plaque in the arteries, experts assign a calcium test score that can range from zero to over 1,000 (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the amount of plaque in the arteries, experts assign a calcium test score that can range from zero to over 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with a score of 100 or less have mild evidence of CAD, those ranking between 100 to 400 have moderate amount of evidence of the disease and those above 400 have strong evidence of CAD in their bodies, according to Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Robert Segal, a board-certified cardiologist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robert Segal, a board-certified cardiologist said: 'I've seen too many patients suffer heart attacks that could have been prevented by knowing their Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The CAC Score is one of the most powerful tools we have to detect heart disease early, before symptoms appear. I strongly recommend getting a CAC scan. It can truly save lives.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This non-invasive scan is usually not covered by insurance companies and can cost anywhere between $100 to $400.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After getting tested, Hollander was told she had a calcium test score ranging in the 50s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was the first indication of what was going on inside my arteries,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/calcium-scoring-test-underused-heart-attack-risk/"&gt;KAFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on this, she was prescribed &lt;span&gt;Crestor (a brand-name prescription drug for statins that help manage cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart attacks) three days a week and she self-injects Repatha (a prescription medication used to lower levels of bad cholesterol) twice-a-month. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 21:15:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNNGc1OWRpblJlNE5YU1JTZ1NwMExPWWlhTVFmN2JPWGdCZ0hPaTdSc1U0eEZqU2dKM25Mc1Y2M1RPMzM0UV8zbTlQanVFOHF5SlBaRzFOZ3ZzVkNZdm5IZVFILXZyWjI0UVhvS1lvZHIybTJUcDk2dDZmYXNTTkxPM1UzRkNMWDBVT1doZDhrUWFENURERnJmWG5aWm1MQzlFYzJtZTBwZ9IBrAFBVV95cUxNWFJHcWtZWmtNWmZ6Rm90S2lERDFvd3ZKcG1NU1hVeDZYNW5raWpfSU1xR2NZMUNYQVlEQmpaVkJtTkhUU0dfdzdMMEpYNDBtOE5zWWR2dkR5WmEteks1QVJNdGc0RzFfdE05NEFYVWNsVFJoZDlhZDZMMDRvTC1oSC1GRnJTYy11a29XTnh5WDlHb2FzbHBxX0dTVXJydmxSNjBxS1JGYWxOdmRn</guid></item><item><title>84%的海德拉巴IT员工存在肝脏风险： Nadda - Deccan Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-main-content dropcap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Hyderabad: &lt;/b&gt;Union health minister Jagat Prakash Nadda on Thursday raised alarm over the high prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and associated metabolic disorders among employees in Hyderabad’s IT sector, calling it a “silent epidemic” that demands urgent and coordinated action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing a study published in Nature Scientific Reports, Nadda told the Lok Sabha on Friday that 84 per cent of IT workers surveyed in Hyderabad showed increased liver fat accumulation, a key indicator of MAFLD. Further, 71 per cent were obese and more than one-third had metabolic syndrome — a cluster of risk factors that heighten vulnerability to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-1 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_1_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The health of India’s workforce is paramount,” said Nadda, emphasising the ministry of health’s existing guidelines under the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases (NP-NCD). These guidelines focus on promoting healthy diets, regular exercise, weight control, and reducing intake of sugar and saturated fats.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replying to questions from Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi and others, Nadda said recent Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) findings showed a 37.19 per cent prevalence of fatty liver disease even in rural Rajasthan, underlining its spread beyond urban centres.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-2 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_2_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To raise awareness, the government is conducting extensive campaigns across print, electronic, and digital media platforms. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has rolled out creative public outreach materials, including engaging short videos on liver health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising the sedentary nature of IT jobs, the ministry of AYUSH has introduced a five-minute “Yoga Break” protocol to be followed during office hours. It combines simple yoga postures (Asanas), breathing techniques (Pranayama) and meditation (Dhyana) to promote physical and mental well-being.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-3 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_3_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, integrated clinical guidelines that blend traditional Indian medicine with modern protocols have been published to ensure a holistic national response. States and Union Territories have been asked to implement screening and referral systems at the community level to aid early detection and intervention.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadda emphasised inter-ministerial collaboration and workplace health advisories as vital tools to combat the rising tide of metabolic and lifestyle diseases, especially in urban corporate ecosystems.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_before_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-before" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_before"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-4 inside-post-ad ads_common_inside_post" id="inside_post_content_ad_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad-after" id="inside_post_content_ad_4_after"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spotlight on Hyderabad’s IT workforce is galvanising India’s public health machinery to address a crucial but under-recognised epidemic to safeguard the well-being of millions in fast-evolving workplaces. The prevalence of increased liver fat and obesity conditions in IT employees highlights the profound impact of sedentary, high-stress work environments common in the tech industry. These findings have prompted comprehensive workplace wellness initiatives to safeguard the health of India’s young, urban workforce.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="hide inside-post-ad filler-ad-unit-inside-post" id="filler_ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key Highlights:  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. 84% of Hyderabad IT employees affected by MAFLD; 71% obese; 34% with Metabolic Syndrome  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Government guidelines promote healthy eating, physical activity and weight management  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.  Multi-channel public awareness campaigns under the National Programme for NCDs and FSSAI outreach  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.  5-minute Yoga Break proposed by the ministry of AYUSH for stress relief and metabolic health  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.  ICMR studies confirm widespread fatty liver disease beyond urban centers  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.  State-level screenings and inter-ministerial collaboration prioritised for comprehensive management  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deccan Chronicle</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 20:58:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>参与绑架、强奸和谋杀13岁女孩的八个“怪物”将她关在水下“直到泡沫停止” --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxPaUZJUEVlT0VBV2FKMHgtYjZfOE9HOEVhRy1Md1RfWkJnajU5aS03NDdwcENmUzRQQnBlbGNCNURxeDZwM09KcXFYb3pPUFpvWWdNTGdQN2hKS01NaWJRU3VwTF9CSWh6ODN3ck5mSkdfaU1sMTN2WFFXTlpINWJUWVJLT1U2S1llQWcyLTVlOFZmMGdkb0xqbTYtYXY3dXIwT3Rhb29mWnRZZE1F0gGyAUFVX3lxTE5lcmZtMVpXOF85SUlvbF9LZlc2emRSUGg0elRBWUhDb2tsRWdYLTY0VnQyT0d3Nkc2LXhoV24yenEzSENUYlVYMTM3TkpJSXhlQTg3S1pVNC1UejZJaWZLYVpNMjMtSXd5U19yS2F5WG91VzZjUVdvVHhnT0w1MkJkcmpVV0hueVNiVEtxWmE0dzFCWDg5SmlrVlBibjVXSkt6R2liSDZYaTBvUmE4Q25HdHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A group of eight 'monsters' banded together in a sick plot which saw a 13-year-old girl kidnapped, gangraped, and then killed - with her remains left floating in a river for nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maryann Measles was last seen on October 19, 1997, when she was abducted from a supermarket parking lot by five men and three women, who she had considered to be her friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The seventh grader had been waiting in the car while her mother carried out errands at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles endured a campaign of torture in the moments before her death, which is laid bare in the latest episode of Investigation Discovery's documentary series A Killer Among Friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And, after her kidnapping, it would be years before her loved ones got answers over what happened to her - and who was responsible for her murder. Here, FEMAIL unpacks the senseless violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being snatched from her mother's car, Measles was taken to River Road in New Milford, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-0e8f76f0-6f08-11f0-afe3-fbe74f109da3"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; where her known attackers - Keith Foster, Dorothy Hallas, Maggie Mae Bennett, Alan Walter, Jeffrey Boyette, Ronald Rajcok, Deaneric Dupas, and June Segar - began beating her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three women who participated in the murder were said to be angry that the teenager had sex with their boyfriends. Measles, however, had been a victim of statutory rape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although she broke away and ran for help, she was chased down by one of the perpetrators, Segar, and dragged back to her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Maryann Measles was last seen on October 19, 1997, when she was abducted from a supermarket parking lot by five men and three women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was years before her friends and family members found out the truth about what happened &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recounting hearing how his late friend Measles died, a man named Scott said in the documentary: 'Them beating on her and raping her and holding her under the water until the bubbles stopped, that's probably the comment that haunts me the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Until the bubbles stopped.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another friend, Donna, added: 'They wrapped her in blankets and chains and they threw her into the river. It breaks my heart that I wasn't there to help her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months before her life was taken, Measles began hanging out with the group of older friends who would later attack and kill her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One evening, she confessed to her mother that she had been raped by some of the older men in the group, including Walter and Foster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles's mother took her to the police station to file statutory rape charges against the men, however only filed a report regarding Walter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although they planned to file a report against Foster, the group of friends hatched a plan to silence Measles, who had opened up about her ordeal and confined in her plan to June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine months after her death, Measles's body was found in Lake Lillinonah in Connecticut, but it was still years before police made any progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles was in the seventh grade when her friends kidnapped her and killed her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the summer of 2001, four years later, cops offered a $50,000 reward for people to come forward with evidence to help solve the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Segar, one of the killers, was keen to get her hands on the money and in 2005, she reached out to police and led them to a crucial piece of evidence: an abandoned washing machine in the middle of the woods containing Measles's clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After linking herself to the crime, Segel admitted that there was eight people involved in the murder and that Walter orchestrated it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking in the documentary, Measles's friend Ashleigh said: 'I was just so sick to think that Mariann thought she was hanging out with friends, but they were planning on murdering her.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was mind-blowing seeing their pictures in cuffs in the news and all over the newspapers,' Scott added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was like wow, I spent every day with those people. I was hanging out with a group of murderers and I didn't even know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I will always harbour some guilt and blame because I literally introduced one of my best friends to her killers and that will never go away.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walter had sex with the teen's corpse before they wrapped her in blanket, tied it with a chain and padlock and then pushed her into the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foster was the only perpetrator whose case went to trial where he was sentenced to 110 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Keith Foster was sentenced to 110 years in prison for his role in Measles's murder &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alan Walter plead guilty to felony murder, first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree sexual assault, and tampering with physical evidence &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was guilty on charges that included felony murder, first-degree sexual assault, three counts of first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping, tampering with a witness, and tampering with physical evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Walter was handed a 60-year sentence for his involvement and was charged with felony murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For their part in the murder, Boyette was sentenced to 50 years, Dupas was sentenced to 47 years , Rajcok was sentenced to 36 years, Segar was sentenced to 30 years, and Hallas was sentenced to 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bennett was sentenced to 19 years after she was charged with first-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, risk of injury to a minor, tampering with a witness, and tampering with evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time of writing, only one out of the eight perpetrators has been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bennett, who received the lightest sentence due to her plea deal, was freed in 2019 after 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She testified that at least three of the boys took turns raping Measles before dragging her to the water to drown her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reflecting on the murder, Measles's younger sister commented in the documentary: 'Two of the guys would have got 18 months for statutory rape, so instead they ended her life and ruined all of ours forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've never raised my kids to believe there are not monsters… I've lived my life with eight monsters.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 20:47:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPaUZJUEVlT0VBV2FKMHgtYjZfOE9HOEVhRy1Md1RfWkJnajU5aS03NDdwcENmUzRQQnBlbGNCNURxeDZwM09KcXFYb3pPUFpvWWdNTGdQN2hKS01NaWJRU3VwTF9CSWh6ODN3ck5mSkdfaU1sMTN2WFFXTlpINWJUWVJLT1U2S1llQWcyLTVlOFZmMGdkb0xqbTYtYXY3dXIwT3Rhb29mWnRZZE1F0gGyAUFVX3lxTE5lcmZtMVpXOF85SUlvbF9LZlc2emRSUGg0elRBWUhDb2tsRWdYLTY0VnQyT0d3Nkc2LXhoV24yenEzSENUYlVYMTM3TkpJSXhlQTg3S1pVNC1UejZJaWZLYVpNMjMtSXd5U19yS2F5WG91VzZjUVdvVHhnT0w1MkJkcmpVV0hueVNiVEtxWmE0dzFCWDg5SmlrVlBibjVXSkt6R2liSDZYaTBvUmE4Q25HdHc</guid></item><item><title>在RFK Jr的领导下， CDC跳过了疫苗接种率的研究，悄悄地在DROP上发布数据- Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNQUFlZ3hRMDRNNWJjU3EwOWRfUjBxajRNbTA5alprcW9ocVgwbDVzVzJzV1NqQzVsSGxEdjJWR3BNN193dnNpMXktRk5iQ05KeWllaW5wT2NjY3d5RW5vaWZJMnFEcWNRZ3hVdjB1M0VodWZpdTZLd1NwQmwySWpLZDF6TlNyYU9BQ3E0dmJfeS1vaVV1TDdaWXo5ZVZHelhsaEJPR2pRSkF4YWI0TE9idUczc0RKMTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates among the country's kindergartners have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;fallen once again&lt;/a&gt;, with coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination dropping from 92.7 percent in the 2023–2024 school year to 92.5 percent in 2024–2025. The percentage changes are small across the board, but they represent thousands of children and an ongoing downward trend that makes the country more vulnerable to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest school year, an estimated 286,000 young children were not fully protected against measles. At the same time, the country has seen numerous explosive measles outbreaks, with case counts in 2025 already higher than any other year since the highly infectious disease was declared eliminated in 2000. In fact, the case count is at &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/07/measles-cases-reach-33-year-high-as-rfk-jr-pursues-anti-vaccine-agenda/"&gt;a 33-year high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest small decline is one in a series that is eroding the nation's ability to keep bygone infectious diseases at bay. In the 2019–2020 school year, 95 percent of kindergartners were protected against measles and other serious childhood diseases, such as polio. That 95 percent coverage is the target that health experts say prevents an infectious disease from spreading in a community. But amid the pandemic, vaccination rates fell, dropping to 93.9 percent MMR coverage in the 2020–2021 year, and have kept creeping downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anti-vaccine era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the height of the pandemic, some slippage in immunization coverage could be blamed on disrupted access. But anti-vaccine sentiments and misinformation are clearly playing a large role as vaccination continues to decline and access has largely resumed. For the 2024–2025 school year, nonmedical exemptions for childhood vaccinations once again hit a new high. These are exemptions driven by ideology and have risen with the influence of anti-vaccine voices, including current health secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;

They discovered that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14821553/Dirty-habit-smoking-marijuana-heart-health-disease.html"&gt;daily smokers were&lt;/a&gt; 3.25 times more likely to develop oral cancer than those without the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Raphael Cuomo, an anesthesiology professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine who led the analysis, said: ‘Cannabis smoke contains many of the same carcinogenic compounds found in tobacco smoke, which have known damaging effects on the epithelial tissue that lines the mouth.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cannabis smoke packs a heavy load of toxic chemicals and carcinogens, about 2,600 of them, similar to tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But researchers are only recently getting a fuller understanding of what those chemicals are. They now know that marijuana smoke contains hundreds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, and ammonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These chemicals adhere to mucus membranes in the mouth, enabling carcinogens to seep into oral tissue. Meanwhile, THC, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana, can suppress crucial immune system pathways that would typically patrol for, and kill, those rogue cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly 18 million Americans are daily or near-daily cannabis users, which researchers have found increases the risk of oral cancer by more than three times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the more than 45,000 patients included in the study, 949 had cannabis use disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The group that did not smoke or smoked only occasionally remained either weed free or only occasional users over the five-year study. Over 97 percent were still abstinent or infrequent users by the time researchers followed up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, 106 patients were diagnosed with oral cancer. Among people without CUD, the rate of oral cancer was 0.23 percent, which matches general population rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, among participants with CUD, 0.74 percent developed oral cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancer includes cancerous growths that develop in the mouth and throat, including the lips, tongue, gums, the floor of the mouth and the roof of the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 59 men and 1 in 139 women will develop oral cancer at some point in their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral cancers account for about three percent of cancers diagnosed in the US every year, with about 58,500 diagnoses and 12,250 deaths annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said their findings will have implications for cancer screening practices in primary care and mental health settings, as patients with CUD often present with overlapping social and behavioral risk factors, including tobacco use, alcohol use, and a lower likelihood of engaging in preventive healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with CUD who were also tobacco users were 6.24 times more likely to get oral cancer. Age also played a role, with each additional year of age increasing cancer risk by about four times per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like tobacco smokers, marijuana smokers see damage to their lung and throat cells, leading to abnormal cell growth that can cause cancer and tissue changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those effects can occur in people who are not tobacco smokers, though, indicating that marijuana smoke can be just as harmful on its own as cigarette smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cuomo said: ‘These findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic or problematic cannabis use may contribute to cancer risk in tissues exposed to combustion products.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335525002244"&gt;Preventive Medicine Reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the United States, marijuana is fully legal for recreational and medicinal use in 29 states. It is entirely illegal in four states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of the public, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use/"&gt;about 88 percent&lt;/a&gt;, supports legalization, according to the Pew Research Center. But public health experts are raising concerns over potential long-term effects, of which scientists still do not have a complete understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In June, University of California researchers reviewed 24 studies involving 200million people to investigate the relationship between weed and cardiovascular disease, stroke and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - a group of heart conditions in which there is reduced or blocked blood flow to the heart, such as a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found there was a 29 percent higher risk of ACS among cannabis users, a 20 percent higher risk for stroke and double the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, which includes coronary artery disease, heart failure and irregular heartbeats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, findings from an FDA-run clinical trial were released, investigating dangerous liver enzyme spikes in people who consumed cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cannabis is becoming easier to access and more potent. The graph refers to smokable cannabis. Other forms, such as vapes, contain up to 98 percent of THC, the psychoactive chemical in the drug linked to psychosis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results showed that eight users of CBD, the substance derived from the hemp plant that's free of the psychoactive chemical THC, developed enzyme spikes above the safe threshold, raising the risk of chronic liver damage or failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seven people dropped out due to liver concerns between weeks three and four. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, everyone's liver tests normalized after quitting CBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, regular use of potent cannabis in adolescence has been linked to long-term changes in brain structure, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, the region responsible for decision-making, emotional regulation, and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also the age when many psychotic disorders first appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;THC may trigger schizophrenia or psychotic episodes in individuals with genetic predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 review by University of Bath researchers, which analyzed 20 studies involving 120,000 people, found users of high-potency cannabis were four times more likely to develop addiction and three to five times more likely to suffer a psychotic break compared to those using lower-potency strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, a report in JAMA Network Open found that emergency room visits in Ontario, Canada, linked to schizophrenia in marijuana users tripled after legalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2006 and 2022, the rate of schizophrenia among those with cannabis use disorder climbed from four percent to over 10 percent. In contrast, just 0.6 percent of non-users developed the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

People who eventually develop MS began increasing healthcare visits—especially for general symptoms like fatigue, pain, and anxiety—15 years before neurologists identified their first demyelinating event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest a lengthy prodromal phase for MS, similar to early-stage Parkinson’s disease, where nonspecific symptoms quietly precede more recognizable ones. Identifying this earlier timeline could lead to proactive support, monitoring, and even future prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long Prodrome:&lt;/strong&gt; Healthcare usage increased steadily over 15 years before MS diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Indicators:&lt;/strong&gt; Fatigue, dizziness, mental health issues, and eye problems were among the first signs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Results challenge the belief that MS only begins with clear neurological symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earliest warning signs of multiple sclerosis (MS) may emerge more than a decade before the first classical neurological symptoms occur, according to new research from the University of British Columbia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published today in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, the study analyzed the health records of more than 12,000 people in British Columbia and found that those with MS began using healthcare services at elevated rates 15 years before their first MS symptoms appear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings challenge long-held assumptions about when the disease truly begins, offering the most comprehensive picture to date of how patients engage with a range of healthcare providers in the years leading up to a diagnosis as they search for answers to ill-defined medical challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“MS can be difficult to recognize as many of the earliest signs—like fatigue, headache, pain and mental health concerns—can be quite general and easily mistaken for other conditions,” said senior author Dr. Helen Tremlett, professor of neurology at UBC’s faculty of medicine and investigator at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings dramatically shift the timeline for when these early warning signs are thought to begin, potentially opening the door to opportunities for earlier detection and intervention.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study used linked clinical and administrative provincial health data to track physician visits in the 25 years leading up to the onset of a patient’s MS symptoms, as determined by a neurologist through detailed medical history and clinical assessments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the first study to examine healthcare usage this far back in a patient’s clinical history. Most previous studies only examined trends in the five to 10 years leading up to a patient’s first demyelinating event (such as vision problems) using administrative data. This is a much later benchmark compared to the neurologist-determined date of symptom onset.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings revealed that, when compared to the general population, people with MS had a steady build-up of healthcare engagement over 15 years with different types of doctor visits increasing at distinct points in time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;15 years before symptom onset:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to general practice physicians increased, as did visits to any physician for symptoms like fatigue, pain, dizziness and mental health conditions including anxiety and depression.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;12 years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to a psychiatrist increased.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Eight to nine years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Visits to neurologists and ophthalmologists increased, which could relate to issues like blurry vision or eye pain.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Three to five years before:&lt;/strong&gt; Emergency medicine and radiology visits increased.&lt;br&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;One year before:&lt;/strong&gt; Physician visits across multiple specialties peaked, including neurology, emergency medicine and radiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patterns suggest that MS has a long and complex prodromal phase—where something is happening beneath the surface but hasn’t yet declared itself as MS,” said Dr. Marta Ruiz-Algueró, a postdoctoral fellow at UBC and the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re only now starting to understand what these early warning signs are, with mental health-related issues appearing to be among the earliest indicators.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study builds on previous work by Dr. Tremlett and her team to characterize the early stages of MS, or prodromal phase, when subtle symptoms appear before the hallmark signs become recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodromal periods are well established in other neurological disorders, like Parkinson’s disease, where mood changes, sleep disturbances and constipation often arise years before the more familiar motor symptoms like tremors and stiffness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the researchers caution that the vast majority of people who experience general symptoms will not go on to develop MS, they say recognizing and characterizing the MS prodrome could one day help accelerate diagnosis and improve outcomes for patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“By identifying these earlier red flags, we may eventually be able to intervene sooner—whether that’s through monitoring, support or preventive strategies,” said Dr. Tremlett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It opens new avenues for research into early biomarkers, lifestyle factors and other potential triggers that may be at play during this previously overlooked phase of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0173647869606f602f69646075696473686f66756e6f417463622f6260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reyhana Heatherington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ubc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of British Columbia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Reyhana Heatherington – University of British Columbia&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.24635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Healthcare use before multiple sclerosis symptom onset&lt;/a&gt;” by Helen Tremlett et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare use before multiple sclerosis symptom onset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care use increases before multiple sclerosis (MS) onset. However, most studies have focused on the 5 to 10 years preceding the first demyelinating disease code from administrative data. Few studies have examined patterns before clinically determined MS symptom onset from clinical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine health care use 25 years before MS symptom onset in a clinical cohort from British Columbia, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matched cohort study accessed data prospectively collected from January 1991 to September 2018. All data were released mid-2024 for analysis. The study was conducted in British Columbia using publicly funded universal health insurance data. Patients with MS were identified from MS clinic records and matched with up to 5 individuals randomly selected without replacement from the general population by sex, birth year, socioeconomic status, and postal code of residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linked clinical and administrative data were used to compare physician visit rates 25 years before MS onset using adjusted negative binomial models and 15 years before MS onset by &lt;em&gt;International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;ICD-9&lt;/em&gt;) chapter and physician specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 2038 patients with MS (mean [SD] age at symptom onset, 37.9 [10.9] years; 1508 female [74.0%]) and 10 182 matched individuals were included. All-cause physician visit rate ratios (RRs) for patients with MS were consistently elevated from 14 years before onset (adjusted RR [ARR], 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.33), peaking the year before MS onset (ARR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.21-1.35).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RRs for ill-defined symptoms and signs were consistently elevated 15 years before onset, exceeding 1.15 and peaking at 1.37 (95% CI, 1.19-1.56) the year before MS onset. Mental health–related RRs from 14 years before onset were significant (excluding years 7, 5, and 4), with RRs in the 3 years before MS onset ranging from 1.30 (95% CI, 1.05-1.58) to 1.38 (95% CI, 1.12-1.68).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensory, musculoskeletal, and nervous system RRs were elevated 8, 5, and 4 years before onset, respectively, with, for example, a peak of 2.42 (95% CI, 1.90-3.07) for nervous system concerns the year before MS onset. By physician specialty, general practice visit RRs were significantly elevated in each of the 15 years before MS onset, reaching 1.23 (95% CI, 1.17-1.30) in the year before onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatry visit RRs were elevated 12 years before onset (2.59; 95% CI, 1.23-5.47). Neurology and ophthalmology RRs were significantly higher up to 8 to 9 years before onset, peaking the year before MS onset at 5.46 (95% CI, 4.30-6.93) for neurology and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.30-2.08) for ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this matched cohort study of people with and without MS, health care use was higher among patients with MS 14 to 15 years before MS symptom onset, suggesting that MS may have started earlier than previously thought. Mental health and psychiatric issues along with ill-defined signs and symptoms might be among the earliest features of the prodromal period preceding nervous system–related and neurologic visits by 7 to 11 years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 19:53:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBVVHlJdkl1eWxZZ1kzMEZuTnNjeVBNUERmekl5REJVZGVEZE1lWUstX1MxM3FGbW5iZDdEb2hzLXd5a0hEeGhUV2phaVh1MGxmY0tWQWEwYi1xOGlON3JIcldENTRtNzFpdTZiZkw5RWhSeWdm</guid></item><item><title>蝙蝠在亚利桑那州飞进女人的嘴里，花费了她近21,000美元的医疗费用- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxON28zSUZrTmsyOE1yMDdDVUlXR194TkRybzczSTFpQjZaQmtZb3NDYTNmbHh3eW80RzdzZDFBNk1oaUZvNzIxZ2l5ZVhIdU0zOWdTalZHYjA0Ui1HRzBjNlRjU0UyYzVQa0JscEVPeXBwVmFXMlRia3pCdWpJalR6T1RWdzRpSTlSeVQyOUVHUmoyUl9pWjRuU2hUb1N1amtaUm90ZmN0NUJ3ei1Rd1E0dnJaRdIBVkFVX3lxTE1iUmthYXJ4eW5FYnc2bWJxSGdnMHpzZy1QdG9pNHZvRUxWVGhjWWsyR1RjaGttWFdONlBRaHhaYlpsa05yOWtod1ZCa0RtaklvdzRzUGt3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2eaaeb" class="body-graf"&gt;A Massachusetts woman was bitten by nearly $21,000 in medical bills &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/chicago-concert-rabies-bat-exposure-rcna174362" target="_blank"&gt;after a bat flew &lt;/a&gt;into her mouth during a freak incident while vacationing in Northern Arizona, the unlucky traveler said Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d7038d" class="body-graf"&gt;Erica Kahn, now 33, had recently lost her job as a biomedical engineer when she traveled to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in last August, she told NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b92c72" class="body-graf"&gt;Kahn, whose woman-vs.-animal story was first reported Thursday by &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tourist-rabies-treatment-wild-bat-in-mouth-surprise-bill-of-the-month/" target="_blank"&gt;KFF News&lt;/a&gt;, was snapping pictures of the night sky when a bat approached and got caught in between her camera and face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b87d6f" class="body-graf"&gt;Then a part of the bat got into her mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-398796" class="body-graf"&gt;"It was kind of dark out and we were out on a cliff, so I was looking down and at my camera, I didn't really see it coming," she said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0e59e" class="body-graf"&gt;"When it got kind of tangled between my face and the camera, it was probably just like a few seconds.

It is critical for hundreds of basic biochemical processes, including muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, the ability of cells to create proteins, and blood pressure regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also calms the nervous system before bed, relaxes the muscles, and helps produce the sleep hormone melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 70 million Americans &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14950975/study-link-irregular-sleep-172-diseases.html"&gt;struggle with insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, and around a quarter of Americans experience daytime sleepiness as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium has been shown in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, the research gold standard, to extend a person's time asleep, improve sleep quality, increase the concentration of melatonin, and decrease the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For sleep improvement, it is crucial to choose magnesium glycinate over magnesium citrate, which is a laxative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 70 million Americans struggle with insomnia. But clinical research has shown magnesium glycinate helps people sleep longer and more efficiently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended daily amount of magnesium is 320 milligrams (mg) a day for women and 420 mg a day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood tests can show whether someone is deficient in magnesium, which can lead to muscle cramps and fatigue, or more serious conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. The normal range for blood magnesium is 1.7 to 2.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One fan of the supplement on Reddit said: ‘It does really improve my sleep in my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I tried magnesium, it's the first time in like decades that I'm sleeping straight for like eight to nine hours. I used to sleep like six hours a day.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another person said: ‘Magnesium did wonders for my restless legs and overall capability to rest. Great stuff!’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third added: ‘I've taken magnesium for the past five years and swear by it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people mentioned, though, that the benefits to their sleep were short-lived, with one saying: ‘It's effects wore off after doing it two nights in a row or so.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some combine it with other supplements for a boost. A commenter said she takes magnesium glycinate combined with calcium and zinc, ‘and I believe it has helped me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Magnesium glycinate calms the nervous system before bed, relaxes the muscles, and helps produce the sleep hormone melatonin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The three-part nighttime cocktail can bring out several benefits, such as enhancing muscle relaxation and melatonin synthesis, boosting GABA (which slows down brain activity), and supporting deeper sleep. The trio may also stabilize circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Magnesium glycinate is well-absorbed in the body, making it more effective, and its gentle nature on the stomach makes it a popular choice for people who struggle to fall asleep or sleep through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2012 double-blind, randomized &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3703169/"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; suggests that magnesium supplementation may significantly improve both subjective and objective measures of insomnia in older adults, offering a potential alternative to conventional sleep medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, conducted among 46 elderly people, found that an eight-week regimen of 500 mg of magnesium daily led to notable improvements in sleep duration, efficiency, and key hormonal markers linked to sleep regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings, while they seem small, were statistically significant improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They revealed that compared to placebo, the magnesium group experienced statistically significant increases in sleep time by 0.2 percent and sleep efficiency increased by three percent, alongside reductions in sleep onset latency by two percent and insomnia severity scores down by 0.06 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Biomarkers such as serum renin, an enzyme that helps regulate blood pressure, and melatonin rose significantly, by more than 0.1 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cortisol levels associated with wakefulness declined significantly by 0.8 percent, suggesting that magnesium plays a dual role in modulating both brain chemical pathways and the body’s circadian rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Getting too little sleep, generally considered to be fewer than seven hours, contributes to several health issues, including bloating, brittle nails, overeating, diabetes, and poor skin. It can also leave people with too little energy to exercise and be active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Past research has shown that ghrelin, a hormone promoting hunger, increases with insufficient sleep, while leptin, a hormone contributing to satiety perception, decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor sleep hygiene has also been linked to inflammation in the body, which can spur the growth of cancer cells, and a higher risk of heart attack or stroke, dementia, and autoimmune disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:46:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQWG5Mc1p1ZDdXR3puaUhpYjk4aThrSlpDNldNdzM5TkJhYTlJZThrOWxlX01qQTA1U2l3UlJKZkROOEdBRUQ1SVpPdFVodFpaYWU4bUEtYzdFMHFfUlJmaVE0VTVNX2JWbzVpQm11TkxvVGJsbEVzc0pjQWVXWVM1dWZJbkpUZ2tMSGo2VXpkbjlPZmhxUFdRcHdXRzlVS05TSlFqS0dYbjVOMEdoNExrOWJB0gG3AUFVX3lxTFBkSklWanpfVl9BbDJ3UEZ1SzVjVkVVeG1vb1pBTkRpMFgxN2ZWSlFHQWZHbjI5cFQyOEZTclBnc05udjNDbW03ZmhKQlZ6ZFc0bUtoelhFM3dJV1FiRlN6dHVSYzlITWZXRlU0Nzg5YWwtMDFCWXpSRVd4anQxbi1ia01qTUp5amljclJlOThRRl9aMnBTdWVKb2FRWHhIaUhteGZNdUo0UzA5ejhmQUhzMFhtcjI5Zw</guid></item><item><title>我的姻亲要求我们提供不可能的帮助。我丈夫让情况变得更糟。-石板</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNM2JsYVhuemhueGlPeVRweUk5SU5PdXZiX0lpVXQwUUhESkQ0YUEwb3BnUUpKY0g1YWxpUlg2NjMzN0ZVbmxTbG1JSlRVeVYxWF9KU29kNFdac3hiYUxDYi1HOWM3cDVqWmhySjRiUExzdEc0WXJzUzl0RFRxODRLU1hn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt4q4ci000j3b7auj8ypuce@published"&gt;My husband’s sister is going through a difficult time: She made some choices that led to her losing her job and may also potentially end her marriage. For now, she and her two middle-school-age kids are staying with my husband’s parents, about an hour away from us. My father-in-law and mother-in-law privately reached out to us to ask if we could take the kids on Saturdays. My in-laws are aging, the kids are emotionally struggling, and the combination is really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt4stx000113b7a6vy32m6b@published"&gt;We have a new baby, and I was not thrilled about the prospect of trying to fit two middle schoolers into the grind of baby care, chores, and no sleep. Money and time are already tight. Plus, I’m still in physical therapy from birth issues. But I agreed to take the kids on Saturdays, with one caveat: That my husband would do most of the active care for them. He agreed, and to his credit, he has been planning activities for the kids. He also isn’t afraid to lay down rules and say no to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt59m8m002j3b7av0oksem3@published"&gt;But the one thing my husband won’t do is food. He’s always avoided doing the shopping and cooking in our house: If there’s no dinner, he’d rather have crackers than shop. One of the kids has very specific dietary needs, something no one told us until my mother-in-law was literally dropping them off. I’m already struggling to feed myself (I’m ravenous all the time from breastfeeding and struggling to keep my weight up). I cannot be planning and budgeting for other people’s brand-name-only specific foods from a store 45 minutes away!&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t want the child to go hungry, but I cannot do one more thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt4q4lz000n3b7asb2t8zen@published"&gt;Don’t do it! Your husband is taking care of these kids and he should be able to feed them. If there are times where you can prepare a meal for everyone that meets your nibling’s dietary needs, then great; you can also try to have a snack on hand for them if you can squeeze that into your normal grocery shopping.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt55q5700253b7a2dglk9bu@published"&gt;But this is not your responsibility. If your husband can’t feed these children, then they can’t come to the house. I could see if your husband’s work schedule prevented him from getting food, but his excuse is simply not wanting to do it? He’s weaponizing his incompetence. I hate that this may mean your nibling will have a few light meals until you husband either gets it together to cook something more substantial or gets out of the babysitting arrangement. But if you step in now, he’ll never get his act together.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdt57ohp00293b7aadvo3gwh@published"&gt;Let your husband know that it is unconscionable that he refuses to provide food for his niblings, especially considering that you are dealing with postpartum issues. Be clear that you won’t be taking on this responsibility and stick to it. If he continues to let the kids come over without adequately caring for them, talk to your in-laws about what’s going on. Your sister-in-law may simply have to make other arrangements. Also, if this is a recurrent issue you’re having with regards to your husband helping around the house, it may be time for couple’s counseling.&lt;/p&gt;

Keep your little one out of Grandma’s house until she makes some major changes. If you’re up to it, you may offer to join in and organize, but if her problem is as bad as it sounds, she probably won’t take your help. Let your husband know that this is not a personal gripe with his mother, but that her place is simply unsafe. Tell him that she needs professional help and offer to brainstorm ideas for how you can make that happening. Hoarding is a serious issue, and it’s not going to go away just because she’s denied a visit from  her grandchild.  You shouldn’t compromise your child’s safety to please her, nor your husband. Keep your foot firmly planted down.&lt;/p&gt;

When the baby was born, I was asked to limit visits to once a week. (We live about 4 miles apart.) This worked fine, and I certainly understand all the exhaustion that comes with a new baby. But a few months after the baby was born, I was right next to their apartment for a medical appointment and texted to ask if I could stop by for a cup of tea and bring pastries. I also voiced that I did not understand the need for complete rigidity, especially after months had gone by. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2024/09/parenting-advice-grandparent-visit-boundaries.html"&gt;Well, I got a big no …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This leads to a dangerous buildup of blood sugar and ketones, which can be life-threatening without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What breakthrough did researchers make about leptin’s role in DKA?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: Scientists discovered that leptin, a hormone signaling energy sufficiency to the brain, can normalize blood sugar and ketone levels—even without insulin—by reprogramming the brain’s response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the implications for diabetes care?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A: If clinical trials succeed, leptin-based therapies could reduce or replace the need for daily insulin injections, revolutionizing type 1 diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A decade after an overlooked discovery, researchers now confirm that the hormone leptin can reverse diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) even without insulin. The brain, misled by low leptin into thinking the body lacks fuel, triggers a metabolic emergency — a core process in DKA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administering leptin in rodents rebalanced glucose and ketone levels, proving the brain can stabilize blood sugar independently of insulin. These findings suggest type 1 diabetes may be treatable through the brain, challenging a century-old insulin-centric model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leptin as a Regulator:&lt;/strong&gt; Leptin informs the brain of energy sufficiency; low levels activate glucose and ketone production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Driven DKA:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s misinterpretation of energy stores, not just insulin loss, drives DKA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapies Ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Leptin-based treatments may offer insulin-free management for type 1 diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Washington&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than a decade ago, researchers found that an acute complication of type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), can be resolved with the hormone leptin, even in the absence of insulin.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis published&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;today in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt; explains how leptin affects the brain and how it might be used in future therapeutics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112055"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-300x233.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-770x599.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-293x228.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-150x117.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a Brain and insulin syringes." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-300x233.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-770x599.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-293x228.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/leptin-type-1-diabetes-neurosciecne-150x117.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Leptin helps the brain regulate appetite and body weight. Leptin is produced by your body’s fat cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;DKA happens when the body is unable to make insulin and begins to break down fat for fuel. This can lead to a life-threatening buildup of sugar (glucose) and ketoacids in the blood. Doctors have typically administered insulin to address the complication, authors noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But evidence now shows that, when insulin is insufficient, the brain plays a key role in  driving DKA, according to the new analysis, based in literature and research that includes studies conducted at UW Medicine since 2011.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pancreas can’t make insulin, “the brain gets the message that the body is out of fuel, even if it’s not. This information is being communicated in part by a low blood level of the hormone leptin,” said senior author Dr. Michael Schwartz, professor of medicine, Division of Metabolism, Endocrinology and Nutrition at the University of Washington School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leptin helps the brain regulate appetite and body weight. Leptin is produced by your body’s fat cells. The hormone  is carried by the bloodstream into your brain, particularly an area called the hypothalamus. This is the part of your brain that controls when and how much you eat. Insufficient leptin leads the brain to activate circuits that mobilize energy sources, including glucose and ketones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz and his team discovered this connection in 2011 when they first administered leptin into the brain of rats and mice with type 1 diabetes. At first, nothing happened. But four days later, they were astonished when the animals’ blood glucose and ketone levels became completely normal, despite ongoing severe insulin deficiency.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the most amazing thing is that the blood sugars just didn’t come down, but that the levels stayed down,” he said. “If you tried to get them to rise, they came back down. If you tried to lower them, they came back up.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These responses suggested that the brain can maintain normal blood sugar levels even in the absence of insulin, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, the diabetes research community didn’t know what to make of the discovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have a much better understanding of a finding that was largely ignored by the scientific community when it was first reported in 2011,” Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz said he will seek FDA approval to begin human trials to test whether leptin is capable of normalizing blood sugar levels in people with type 1 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive results would open the door to pharmaceutical therapies for type 1 diabetes that target the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the most exciting discoveries of my career,” said co-author Dr. Irl Hirsch, a UW Medicine’s diabetes treatment and teaching chair and a professor of metabolism, endocrinology and nutrition at the University of Washington School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hirsch said controlling blood glucose with leptin could  unlock new avenues of treatment for patients.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t get me wrong, discovering insulin 104 years ago is one of the greatest discoveries of the last century,” said Hirsch, who has had type 1 diabetes since childhood. “But this, this is the next step. This might be a better way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz noted that insulin management is a substantial burden for patients and their families.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think if you could treat type 1 diabetes without daily insulin injections and blood sugar monitoring, patients would say that is the greatest thing ever,” he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the brain can be convinced that fuel stores are not depleted, or if specific brain neurons that trigger the production of glucose and ketones are turned off, the body stops the reaction that leads to severe hyperglycemia and DKA.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new framework challenges that conventional wisdom about insulin deficiency as the sole cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that has been widely accepted for decades,” said Schwartz. “It shows that the brain plays a powerful role in the genesis of uncontrolled diabetes — and may hold the key to new treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this research was supported by National Institutes of Health (grants DK083042, DK101997, DP2DK128802, DK089056, DK124238 and S10OD036208); the NIH-NIDDK funded Nutrition Obesity Research Center (NORC P30DK035816), Diabetes Research Center (DRC P30DK017047) and the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Training Grant (T32 DK007247) at the University of Washington; and the Department of Defense Peer-Reviewed Medical Research Program (W81XWH-20-1-0250).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diabetes and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aecccfcd989eeedbd980cbcadb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Barbara Clements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uw.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Barbara Clements – University of Washington&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be published in &lt;em&gt;JCI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:27:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE84d28ydml6RXBMQ0sxUlRQT0piVmxjR21BdUEtMEJaTWVfR0pwN0hKUXFlVl9JNGZaajFTdzRzNExpUEpOTEpBTFp4X0VVaDJpb0k3YnJTRlc3VzlZbjRueVNlWUxpMW50SmxYU2dUcnVhdw</guid></item><item><title>两个孩子的健康爸爸在家里闻到了漂白剂的味道，并假设他的妻子一直在打扫卫生。然后，他接受了毁灭性的诊断- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFAtZTRoWnNMZTIzOUV2clM4T2p2UF9IU2hzRGs5bkZYSFkwbUhwS2VHVWdwUFZCb3FpVjFIYTBzZ2FKbHRIaE1qX3lkX3luNlRWZnQ5NlJDWGxVUUpBZGFyUDF4YTBnZ0VBUnVWd01wY3I?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dad of two was diagnosed with a brain tumor in February 2020 after experiencing "strange symptoms"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Suriakumar, 40, said he’d been "smelling a strange smell and feeling really unwell" in the days leading up to his diagnosis with a glioma, describing the smell as "like ammonia or bleach"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar assumed his wife Sindhu, with whom he shares daughters Avaana, 10, and Arya, 8, had been cleaning the bathroom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A British father of two is speaking out about receiving a devastating diagnosis after noticing he had some strange symptoms — which included randomly smelling bleach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Suriakumar, now 40, was diagnosed with a glioma in February 2020 after having a seizure on the London Underground on his way home from work, according to the &lt;a href="https://braintumourresearch.org/blogs/latest-news/brain-tumour-research-supporter-ambassador-sam-suriakumar-celebrates-his-40th-birthday-with-a-moving-film-watch-it-here" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brain Tumor Research website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brain Tumor Research website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21969-glioma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, a "glioma is a tumor that forms in the brain or spinal cord."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are several types, including astrocytomas, ependymomas and oligodendrogliomas.

I now know this as a symptom or a warning sign called an ‘aura,'" he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14959431/inoperable-brain-tumour-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the first time Suriakumar smelled the bleach, he assumed his wife, Sindhu, had been cleaning the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt like I needed to lean against the wall to stand, I felt very strange but didn't think much of it," he said of experiencing the symptoms, per the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar added, according to the Brain Tumor Research site, "The next day, when I was lifting a heavy weight at the gym, I experienced the same smell. I felt like I was going to collapse, and I had to put the weight down," sharing, "I didn’t know it was a trigger warning that something was going on in my brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He remembered going back to his office in central London, but "didn't feel right" and "couldn’t face sitting in front of a computer screen," so headed home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While on the subway, Suriakumar said he closed his eyes, but opened them "just two minutes later," despite it feeling "like so much time had passed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he'd "had a full tonic-clonic seizure on the tube," adding, "My seizure was so severe that I fell off my seat, and the contractions were so violent that I dislocated my shoulder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar — who shares daughters Avaana, 10, and Arya, 8, with his wife Sindhu — wrote, "A member of the public had pulled the emergency lever on the tube, and I was taken off at Balham [London Underground station] where the station staff called an ambulance. Later, I was told I’d had another seizure in the ambulance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained that the doctors at St. George's Hospital, where he was taken, "didn't know" why he was having the seizures, as he'd "had no previous symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar recalled, "I had some scans and a lumbar puncture to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. At first, nothing really showed on the scan, but a further scan revealed a mass on my brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When they told me, I was devastated. I didn’t even understand those words. To me they just meant death with a zero per cent chance of fighting this," he continued, adding that "suddenly" his "life changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn’t work, I couldn’t drive, and my future was far from certain. It felt like life had stopped and I was in a dark tunnel with no light. I couldn’t speak, hear or understand what was going on," he shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suriakumar said that the COVID lockdown "soon followed" and he enjoyed some quality time with his wife, whom he married in 2011, and two girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After thanking people for their support, Suriakumar continued, "My brain [tumor] is a glioma and it was growing like a cobweb. This means it is difficult to remove with surgery without causing damage to the areas of my brain which control speech, memory, emotions and mobility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that he was told if he "did have an operation, it would only be possible to remove 40% of the mass."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;, Suriakumar was later told that his tumor had grown while he was at a wedding in Brazil in July 2023, after his condition had remained stable for two years. Not long after flying back to the U.K., he underwent surgery to have some of the tumor removed, the outlet noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In August 2023, I had a biopsy followed by a course of radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden in Sutton. I then underwent a year-long course of chemotherapy which finished in September 2024," Suriakumar shared with Brain Tumor Research, stating that he was "really sick during chemotherapy" and lost around 44 lbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Suriakumar has been working on his health, completing a fitness competition in Belgium in April of this year, as well as recently &lt;a href="https://braintumourresearch.org/blogs/latest-news/brain-tumour-research-supporter-ambassador-sam-suriakumar-celebrates-his-40th-birthday-with-a-moving-film-watch-it-here" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:celebrating his 40th birthday;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;celebrating his 40th birthday&lt;/a&gt; on July 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I now have check-up scans every six months. My most recent one was in May, and it was stable which is what I’m looking for," he told Brain Tumor Research. "When I was first diagnosed, my oncologist gave me a poor prognosis … I didn’t think I’d get to see my 40th, that’s the crude reality of living with a brain [tumor]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I was first diagnosed, I didn’t even think I’d see the end of the week. Forty was always a big benchmark number because of the poor survival statistics for people with brain [tumors], so getting to celebrate it has been a massive dream for me," Suriakumar insisted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/healthy-dad-smelled-bleach-home-received-devastating-diagnosis-11783255" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 18:18:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFAtZTRoWnNMZTIzOUV2clM4T2p2UF9IU2hzRGs5bkZYSFkwbUhwS2VHVWdwUFZCb3FpVjFIYTBzZ2FKbHRIaE1qX3lkX3luNlRWZnQ5NlJDWGxVUUpBZGFyUDF4YTBnZ0VBUnVWd01wY3I</guid></item><item><title>研究表明， 4个北卡罗来纳州县的性病发病率是美国最高的县之一。查看完整列表-夏洛特观察家报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNUVNURTRYNjBucXE2bjhBelRjN0hYeW5tektWZk5oOWFCendhaC11NVh1WGhIRy1tREpUVmFQbVB2NTJaRjZORkp2dklpQ1ZxZGJyYXlSUXJRSzF0TXRRZ2tPZ1RSSlJZMHo3WjRDRGZJay0xN1M3d2xzWDkyX0ZnTW1aUUg0R2Rt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="" class="paper story-body"&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent report found that four counties in North Carolina are among the top 50 in the nation for highest sexually transmitted diseases (STD) infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The report from Invigor Medical&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medical clinic based in Washington, gathered data on the number of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia cases reported in each county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that &lt;b&gt;Cumberland County&lt;/b&gt;

Testing gives you the information you need to take protective steps — for yourself and partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your healthcare provider about which STD tests are right for you, and encourage your partner to get tested as well. It’s the only way to be sure you’re both covered, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="18" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many STDs are simple to detect and treat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912011/whats-the-big-deal-about-sugar-we-have-your-questions-answered/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar may have a bad reputation&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not the primary cause of diabetes. In fact, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have completely different underlying causes. Type 1 diabetes is an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/having-one-autoimmune-condition-can-increase-your-chance-of-developing-others-heres-why-8402183" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;autoimmune disease&lt;/a&gt; in which the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is more complicated. It typically stems from a combination of factors such as genetics, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, body composition and lifestyle habits like diet and physical inactivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Type 2 diabetes doesn’t have a single cause, especially not sugar alone. Diets high in ultra-processed foods, which often contain added sugars, fats and refined carbs, have been linked to insulin resistance and glucose dysregulation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ina-flores" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Ina Flores, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although eating too much added sugar can play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes, it’s not a direct cause. “It’s not about one food or ingredient. It’s about the overall dietary pattern and metabolic health,” Flores says.

Fiber-rich carbohydrates like legumes, whole grains, fruit and vegetables are especially good choices. They digest more slowly,  support &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-blood-sugar-balance-11781367" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;glycemic control&lt;/a&gt; and provide &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diabetes-vitamin-deficiency-study-8784014" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;essential vitamins and minerals&lt;/a&gt; that are important for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;diabetes management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although some people can manage type 2 diabetes with lifestyle changes alone, this isn’t possible for everyone. Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease, which means your management plan can change over time. Insulin is the hormone that allows blood sugar to enter your cells, and in type 2 diabetes, the body’s ability to produce it can decline—even with healthy habits. When there isn’t enough insulin, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894414/what-to-do-if-you-eat-too-much-sugar-when-you-have-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar builds up&lt;/a&gt; and can cause damage throughout the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Taking insulin can be a life-saving tool to keep your blood sugar levels balanced—and isn’t a sign of failure. For people with type 1 diabetes, insulin is essential for survival, as their pancreas no longer produces it, regardless of lifestyle habits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s a common misconception that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt; is a reliable measure of overall health. In reality, BMI doesn’t distinguish between muscle and fat or account for other contributing factors like genetics, ethnicity, environment, age and stress. For example, a person classified as “obese” based on BMI may have a healthy body composition with higher muscle mass and lower fat mass, while someone with a “normal” BMI may carry excess fat and have low muscle mass—putting them at greater risk for health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research suggests that central adiposity—fat stored around the abdomen—is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8038155/research-testing-for-type-2-diabetes-at-physical-exam/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stronger predictor of diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt; than BMI.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, even individuals with a lower or “normal” BMI can develop type 2 diabetes. “It would be wrong to assume those in the normal range BMI category are protected from developing type 2 diabetes. We need to acknowledge other risk factors of blood sugar dysregulation and insulin resistance to avoid missed diagnoses,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meredith-rofheart-ms-rd-cdn-251b4320a" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Meredith Rofheart, M.S., RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there isn’t currently a cure for diabetes—though hopefully there will be one day—it is possible to reach remission, meaning you can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;manage your blood sugar levels without medication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Remission is possible for some people with type 2 diabetes, especially after significant weight loss and early intervention, but it’s not a cure,” says Flores. “Maintaining remission requires ongoing lifestyle changes, regular medical follow-up and support. Weight regain or declining beta cell function can lead to relapse, so long-term support is essential.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the myths out there, there are many lifestyle habits that can help you effectively manage your diabetes.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Your Portions.&lt;/strong&gt; Being mindful of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8019115/what-are-portion-sizes-do-they-matter/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;portion sizes&lt;/a&gt; can help you manage your carbohydrate and calorie intake. A helpful guideline is to fill half of your plate with nonstarchy vegetables, one quarter with complex carbohydrates, and the remaining quarter with lean protein.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Screened Early.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/risk-factors-prediabetes-8733895" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;family history of diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or other risk factors, it’s important to speak with your health care provider. Early detection can help you take steps to prevent or delay complications.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with a Professional.&lt;/strong&gt; A registered dietitian or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES)&lt;/a&gt; can help personalize your plan that fits with your lifestyle and individual needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The myths around diabetes aren’t just wrong—they’re harmful. They can trap people in fear, shame and confusion—often delaying effective care. But here’s the truth: diabetes management isn’t about perfection or punishment. It’s about meeting people where they are—understanding their barriers, helping them navigate the emotional challenges of the condition and equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary for self-care. Whether you’re trying to prevent, manage or simply understand diabetes better, replacing myths with facts can make all the difference.&lt;br&gt;

If that sounds too good to be true, research confirms it.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fatty fish.&lt;/strong&gt; Fish like salmon, sardines and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-whole-grains-for-to-improve-insulin-resistance-8424201" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increase insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;. Research also suggests that omega-3s increase fat burning in the liver, muscle and fat tissue, reducing fat storage in these areas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruits and vegetables. &lt;/strong&gt;Produce is high in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber and antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are beneficial for reducing visceral fat. One study linked a 3.5-ounce daily increase in fruit and vegetable consumption to a reduction of two-thirds of an inch of visceral fat in women.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yogurt. &lt;/strong&gt;This dairy food is packed with protein and probiotics that may help reduce visceral fat by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting gut health&lt;/a&gt;, improving satiety and reducing inflammation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Reducing visceral fat isn’t about restriction; it’s about routine," Lofton explains. "The good news? It responds well to everyday changes to how you eat, move and live."

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a Mediterranean-style diet.&lt;/strong&gt; "A Mediterranean-style eating pattern, with vegetables, whole grains, legumes, olive oil and nuts like almonds, is one of the most effective ways to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292293/9-things-you-shouldnt-do-if-youre-trying-to-trim-belly-fat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;target visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; and improve metabolic health," says Lofton.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit refined carbs.&lt;/strong&gt; "Avoid ultra-processed snacks and sugary drinks that spike insulin," says Jowett. Research shows that a higher intake of processed foods is associated with higher body fat, particularly visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving. &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t need extreme workouts to get rid of visceral fat. Lofton recommends walking, short bursts of movement and consistency over time for a sustainable impact.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize quality sleep.&lt;/strong&gt; Even a single night of poor sleep can throw off your appetite-regulating hormones and reduce insulin sensitivity, which may lead to increased calorie intake and encourage your body to store more visceral fat rather than using it for energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reducing visceral fat is important for lowering your risk of chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. While there is no single magical food that will get rid of visceral fat, almonds offer a unique combination of nutrients that can help support your efforts. Enjoy them as part of a balanced diet along with other healthy habits like getting quality sleep, staying active and limiting your intake of highly processed foods.

For every single indication that people are using diphenhydramine, there are better drugs that are more effective at treating the symptoms people are trying to treat with fewer side effects,” she said. “I’ve had patients where I worried that diphenhydramine was impairing their ability to drive or fully participate in their daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolfson isn’t alone in preferring alternatives. In a &lt;a href="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:review;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; published in February, allergy experts from Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, San Diego called for the removal of diphenhydramine from over-the-counter and prescription markets in the United States, saying it’s outdated, dangerous and eclipsed by safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A first-generation antihistamine approved in 1946, diphenhydramine is widely used for allergies, sleep aid and cold symptoms. It’s a common over-the-counter medication in the US, with usage rising in the summer months as people use it to treat itching from bug bites or poison ivy, as well as sneezing and runny nose caused by grass and pollen allergies, according to the American Pharmacists Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite its longstanding presence in American homes, the authors of the new review say it poses disproportionate risks, especially for children and older adults, than newer antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Patients should trial alternatives agents like loratadine, which is Claritin, or cetirizine, which is Zyrtec, or fexofenadine, which is Allegra,” to alleviate allergy symptoms, Dr. James Clark of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the lead author of the paper, told CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents the OTC medicine industry, says that common side effects associated with products containing diphenhydramine are disclosed on the label. However, it notes, “these products are not intended for long-term use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When used as directed, these medicines provide well-established therapeutic benefits for common health ailments like allergies, the common cold, motion sickness, minor skin irritations, and occasional sleeplessness,” the group said in a statement on behalf of Benadryl’s maker, Kenvue. “Like all medicines, responsible use is essential, and consumers should always follow directions and warnings on the Drug Facts labels and consult healthcare providers if they have questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Risks of diphenhydramine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Antihistamines work by blocking receptors called H1, part of the body’s system for responding to allergens, which trigger symptoms like sneezing, itching and a runny nose. But older drugs like diphenhydramine don’t just block the allergy-related receptors, they can also affect other parts of the brain. Diphenhydramine often causes sedation, cognitive impairment, and in some cases, dangerous cardiac effects, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In older adults, the drug can stay in the body for up to 18 hours, resulting in lingering sleepiness, disorientation and increasing risk of falling. The review also highlighted a possible link between long-term diphenhydramine use and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25621434/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In children, the risks can be even more pronounced. The review’s authors cite cases of accidental overdose; paradoxical reactions such as agitation, extreme sedation and coma; and even death, particularly with pediatric formulations, because of accidental ingestions. The medication was linked to several child hospitalizations and fatalities during the viral &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/18/us/benadryl-tiktok-challenge-teen-death-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“Benadryl Challenge”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“Benadryl Challenge”&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Manuela Murray, director of general pediatrics and urgent care at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says diphenhydramine “should not be used lightly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It should always be used under the guidance of a Medical Professional, and it is only indicated to treat allergic reactions and motion sickness,” Murray wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The medication is often misused and “doesn’t offer a benefit for treatment of cold symptoms, and it is not a safe sleep aid medication,” she said. In fact, it can have the opposite effects in children, leading to hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Alyssa Kuban, a pediatrician and associate medical director at Texas Children’s Pediatrics, also said that she finds diphenhydramine overused for symptoms it does not directly treat and that there are safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I see some families use diphenhydramine when the child has a cold or upper respiratory infection, thinking it will help with the congestion and help them to sleep better at night,” she said. “This is not effective for cold symptoms, nor is it very safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She recommends over-the-counter cetirizine to treat children with hives, seasonal allergies or an itchy rash. Cetirizine is also longer-lasting and not as sedating as diphenhydramine, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Murray agrees that loratadine and cetirizine are safer for children over 6 months, and saline drops and suctioning are better alternatives for infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;‘Time to say a final goodbye’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Diphenhydramine appears in over 300 OTC formulations, often blended into combination products for coughs, colds and flu. The authors of the review say that, like products with pseudoephedrine, diphenhydramine should at minimum be moved behind the counter, allowing pharmacists to guide patients toward second-generation alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Pharmacists Association says patients should use caution with combination cough and cold products that contain diphenhydramine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pharmacists may recommend alternative medications for older adults who have a history of being cognitively affected by certain medications, the group says, and it “encourages patients and parents/caregivers to ask their pharmacist for the most appropriate treatment recommendation for their symptoms” with the least amount of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The review authors also emphasize that there is no strong clinical data that may suggest that diphenhydramine works better than other options. Although it may reduce symptoms like sneezing and itching, it has minimal effect on nasal congestion and doesn’t outperform second-generation drugs in randomized trials. Newer options, such as oral cetirizine, offer 24-hour coverage with fewer adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, in the US, the medication remains a staple. According to the review, more than 1.5 million prescriptions are still written annually, not counting untracked OTC purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In the past, it has been a useful medication that has helped millions of patients; however, its current therapeutic ratio is matched or exceeded by second-generation antihistamines, especially due to their markedly reduced adverse reactions. It is time to say a final goodbye to diphenhydramine, a public health hazard,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:11:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNclVsNTZTV1M2T1BMZXdzSnRwUTZPcXlnZU90aUxQNXZDU1A3MTRmRTNoWjRRQlNGbVZZS09yYks1VzExVGZJdGVDTXpmSjBXRzhtenQ5RUpMTU1EZWZKTEp4MlZwTFVjZm41TC1WN3RqMU81Y091aWk5OEl2SVRYU0lmeks0Yzh5c1VsSDlEYXAwdVdDMEE</guid></item><item><title>每天只喝一杯饮食苏打水可能会使您的2型糖尿病风险增加38 ％ - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNVDNNZTJJQllmQVFETjNGanZGVkV6ZjV1aC1MSmR4V1M1cHJ6UXNDdDRPMnRMY1dzR2g1N2IzREhkS1ZWU25LUTFqdVFMWUMyeTFmemN1WGE3dlNVT3dWbnU0aEQwRWYzSWxjTVkweDdpX2RQckpUUzdtZmFQRnJYdTZsd3NFekdaSm5VX21GTVZPNnY3NW9vamdUdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners were introduced to offer a healthier alternative to sugar – but as a new study highlights, these substitutes bring their own health risks with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it doesn't take much of the stuff to make a difference: the researchers behind the study, from several institutions in Australia and the Netherlands, found that drinking just a single can of artificially sweetened soft drink a day over several years was associated with a 38 percent higher risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, compared to people who rarely drank sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, that's higher than the 23-percent increase in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="169766" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; risk associated with sugar-sweetened drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are based on the eating and drinking habits of 36,608 Australians aged between 40 and 69. Participants reported their artificial sweetener and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/research-shows-sugar-can-change-your-brain-here-s-how"&gt;sugar consumption&lt;/a&gt;, and their health records were then followed for an average of 14 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-what-diet-soft-drink-could-be-doing-to-your-health-in-the-long-term?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Here's What 'Diet' Soft Drink Could Be Doing to Your Health in The Long Term&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​​​​"Drinking one or more of these beverages each day – whether sweetened with sugar or artificial substitutes – was linked to a significantly higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/one-can-of-artificially-sweetened-soft-drink-daily-may-increase-diabetes-risk-by-more-than-a-third"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Robel Hussen Kabthymer, nutritionist at Monash University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, when body weight was factored in, the link between sugary drinks and type 2 diabetes disappeared – suggesting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-cells-seem-to-cling-to-the-memory-of-being-obese-study-finds"&gt;being overweight&lt;/a&gt; was driving that particular association. When body weight was factored into the artificial sweetener link, however, the increased risk was still present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-in-your-blood-could-affect-body-fat-and-diabetes-risk-study-reveals"&gt;so many known contributors&lt;/a&gt; to type 2 diabetes risk, the researchers can't say artificial sweeteners are causing it directly. &lt;span&gt;All the data shows is that a link exists, but further investigation is needed to unpack it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169769" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169769" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SpoonSugar.jpg" alt="Sugar in a bowl" class="wp-image-169769 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SpoonSugar.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SpoonSugar-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/SpoonSugar-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169769" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Artificial sweeteners are often marketed as healthier alternatives to sugar.

With different artificial sweeteners sold in different countries, and different eating and drinking habits across the globe, it's important to gather as much data as possible on potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Artificial sweeteners are often recommended to people at risk of diabetes as a healthier alternative, but our results suggest they may pose their own health risks," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/one-can-of-artificially-sweetened-soft-drink-daily-may-increase-diabetes-risk-by-more-than-a-third"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Barbora de Courten, biomedical scientist at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suspect that certain artificial sweeteners could be interfering with blood sugar levels, in turn contributing to an increased type 2 diabetes risk. For example, the widely used sweetener aspartame has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2010.03.009"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to trigger the same insulin response as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other sweeteners &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13793"&gt;are known to&lt;/a&gt; disrupt gut bacteria, increasing glucose intolerance in the body. These kinds of interactions and others could well be increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes, even in people who aren't gaining weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers want to see more done to raise awareness of the possible health hazards of artificial sweeteners. In recent years, research has also linked these sugar substitutes to problems with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-sweetener-could-damage-critical-brain-barrier-risking-stroke"&gt;brain integrity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage"&gt;heart damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We support measures like sugary drink taxes, but our study shows we also need to pay attention to artificially sweetened options," &lt;a href="https://www.monash.edu/news/articles/one-can-of-artificially-sweetened-soft-drink-daily-may-increase-diabetes-risk-by-more-than-a-third"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; de Courten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are often marketed as better for you, yet may carry their own risks.

    &lt;p&gt;United States kindergarten vaccination rates decreased last year while exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;new federal data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, posted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website Thursday, showed vaccination coverage among kindergartners during the 2024 to 2025 school year decreased for all reported vaccines from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the data, about 92.1% kindergartners got the diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), and 92.5% received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) and polio vaccine — all down slightly from the previous school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These decreases come as the U.S. has recorded the most &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in more than 30 years. A large share of the infections were connected to a West Texas outbreak primarily affecting children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say outbreaks like these are more likely when vaccination rates drop — and rates have &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-vaccination-rates-us-counties-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;already fallen below&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-vaccination-rate-herd-immunity/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;95% needed for herd immunity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemptions among U.S. kindergartners also rose to an all-time high during the 2024 to 2025 school year, the data showed, increasing to 3.6% from 3.3% the year before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exemptions increased in 36 states and Washington, D.C., with 17 states reporting exemptions exceeding 5%, the CDC added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/measles-outbreak-grows-to-nearly-100-cases-with-largest-impact-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"CBS Mornings"&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year about the measles outbreak, Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, expressed worry over &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-measles-mmr-vaccine-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;exemption increases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted," she said, adding, for most people, the MMR vaccine will protect you for life against measles, one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Doctors and public health officials say the vaccine, which has been used for decades, is safe and highly effective.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;"Fibermaxxing" is one of the latest trends on TikTok and, as a dietitian, it's actually one I can get behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans aren't coming close to eating enough fiber every day, and the goal of fibermaxxing is to hit or exceed one's suggested daily intake of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, fiber is crucial to a healthy diet. It keeps your digestive system moving and can also help you feel full, support gut health, and play a role in reducing the risk of certain chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While upping my fiber game, I also follow the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/favorite-mediterranean-diet-meals-to-prep-from-someone-followed-years" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; — a flexible healthy eating pattern that focuses on maximizing whole grains and fresh produce while limiting processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costco is one of my go-to spots to stock up on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-fiber-foods-blue-zones-longevity-diet-includes-nut-bread-2022-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fiber-rich staples&lt;/a&gt; in bulk that fit the bill and work with my diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here area few of my favorite finds that help me hit my fiber goals without sacrificing flavor or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

                              &lt;p&gt;Frozen fruit can be just as nutritious as fresh and oftentimes, it's much more economical. I especially like the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-end-costco-things-to-get-from-employee-kirkland-signature-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Kirkland Signature&lt;/a&gt; triple-berry blend, which contains raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This antioxidant-loaded mix is a dietitian's dream. I toss the berries into my breakfast bowls, blend them into smoothies, and just snack on them straight from the bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these, I can have a naturally sweet fiber boost without having to worry about eating tons of fresh fruit before it gets moldy and mushy.&lt;/p&gt;

Each patty contains 6 grams of fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lean on these for nights when I really don't feel like cooking and a burger is calling my name. All I have to do is heat a patty up and enjoy it with a whole-grain bun, veggies, some avocado mash, and a side salad.&lt;/p&gt;

Although it's advertised as a protein cereal, Catalina Crunch also doesn't disappoint in the fiber department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It contains a whopping 9 grams of fiber per serving — much more than what other classic cinnamon-toast cereals provide. And, in my humble opinion, it tastes just as good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use it as a yogurt topper, mix it with other cereals for breakfast, or eat it on its own as a snack.&lt;/p&gt;

But over the following decade, something unusual happened. Five of the children stopped coming to the clinic to collect their drugs, and when the team eventually tracked them down many months later, they appeared to be in perfect health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Instead of their viral loads being through the roof, they were undetectable,” says Goulder. “And normally HIV rebounds within two or three weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03105-4"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt;, Goulder described how all five remained in remission, despite having not received regular antiretroviral medication for some time, and in one case, up to 17 months. In the decades-long search for an HIV cure, this offered a tantalizing insight: that the first widespread success in curing HIV might not come in adults, but in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;At the recent International AIDS Society conference held in Kigali, Rwanda, in mid-July, Alfredo Tagarro, a pediatrician at the Infanta Sofia University Hospital in Madrid, presented a new study showing that around 5 percent of HIV-infected children who receive antiretrovirals within the first six months of life ultimately suppress the HIV viral reservoir—the number of cells harboring the virus’s genetic material—to negligible levels. “Children have special immunological features which makes it more likely that we will develop an HIV cure for them before other populations,” says Tagarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;His thoughts were echoed by another doctor, Mark Cotton, who directs the children’s infectious diseases clinical research unit at the University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Kids have a much more dynamic immune system,” says Cotton. “They also don’t have any additional issues like high blood pressure or kidney problems. It makes them a better target, initially, for a cure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to Tagarro, children with HIV have long been “left behind” in the race to find a treatment that can put HIV-positive individuals permanently into remission. Since 2007, 10 adults are thought to have been cured, having received stem cell transplants to treat life-threatening blood cancer, a procedure which ended up eliminating the virus. Yet with such procedures being both complex and highly risky—other patients have died in the aftermath of similar attempts—it is not considered a viable strategy for specifically targeting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Instead, like Goulder, pediatricians have increasingly noticed that after starting antiretroviral treatment early in life, a small subpopulation of children then seem able to suppress HIV for months, years, and perhaps even permanently with their immune system alone. This realization initially began with certain isolated case studies: the “Mississippi baby” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4240852/"&gt;who controlled&lt;/a&gt; the virus for more than two years without medication, and a South African child who was considered &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/what-can-science-learn-child-who-has-controlled-hiv-without-drugs-more-8-years"&gt;potentially cured&lt;/a&gt; having kept the virus in remission for more than a decade. Cotton says he suspects that between 10 and 20 percent of all HIV-infected children would be capable of controlling the virus for a significant period of time, beyond the typical two to three weeks, after stopping antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:19:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQUDJHWnVsNFVUaDRtRHRQSnRWQmxwUUlMOW5aaTl1NUIxbHVsb3dsSlRhN2pBOE9JZUN4N0hLYnNRenVQWUFjX1dOdk41VkNQWkM1TzJubFl2WE9nODFNdjdneHYzSkdCNmRuSXA4VW12MWVyTHZlSnRTVnY1RzZOT1E4VFM2bU1iandn</guid></item><item><title>研究显示， “运动失调”现象可能影响三分之一的人- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQdnFnUk4tY0JhRjdFWmFrVFl6VXpNOWNPci1IX085NXEyNGVUZnpEWFlMUGw1djBFOGNPU3dyQlZ6SGF2dUxVcDlDS0psVGZ1Yk0tbGVnbkZBVGdjYVl5NWFMajBJbmV5a2dJaFdIWkFYQ0wtdVlKbHA2MFpfVDNzUjMtLU53NjZYWGlZcS10SC1oU1h2NllJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Noticing somebody fidgeting can be distracting. Vexing. Even excruciating. But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in 2021, the stressful sensations caused by seeing others fidget are an incredibly common psychological phenomenon, affecting as many as one in three people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://www.misokinesia.ca"&gt;misokinesia&lt;/a&gt; – meaning 'hatred of movements' – this strange phenomenon had been little studied by scientists until recent years, but was noted in the context of a related condition, &lt;a href="a-super-sensitive-brain-connection-could-be-why-some-people-can-t-stand-certain-sounds"&gt;misophonia&lt;/a&gt;: a disorder where people become &lt;a href="can-t-stand-the-sound-of-people-chewing-blame-your-brain-science-misophonia"&gt;irritated upon hearing certain repetitious sounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misokinesia is somewhat similar, but the triggers are generally more visual, rather than sound-related, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary on the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Misokinesia] is defined as a strong negative affective or emotional response to the sight of someone else's small and repetitive movements, such as seeing someone mindlessly fidgeting with a hand or foot," a team of researchers, led by first author and psychologist Sumeet Jaswal, then at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;explained in a study published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yet surprisingly, scientific research on the topic is lacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/angry-outbursts-could-literally-be-putting-some-peoples-heart-at-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Angry Outbursts Could Literally Be Putting Some People's Heart at Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve our understanding, Jawal and fellow researchers conducted what they said was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;"first in-depth scientific exploration"&lt;/a&gt; of misokinesia – and the results indicate that heightened sensitivity to fidgeting is something a large number of people have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across a series of experiments involving over 4,100 participants, the researchers measured the prevalence of misokinesia in a cohort of university students and people from the general population, assessing the impacts it had upon them, and exploring why the sensations might manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg" alt="hands fidgeting" class="wp-image-144167 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Misokinesia creates strong emotional responses on seeing small, repetitive movements. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that approximately one-third self-reported some degree of misokinesia sensitivity to the repetitive, fidgeting behaviors of others as encountered in their daily lives," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results support the conclusion that misokinesia sensitivity is not a phenomenon restricted to clinical populations, but rather, is a basic and heretofore under-recognized social challenge shared by many in the wider, general population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the analysis, misokinesia sometimes goes hand in hand with the sound-sensitivity of misophonia, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon seems to vary significantly among individuals, with some people reporting only low sensitivity to fidgeting stimuli, while others feel highly affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are negatively impacted emotionally and experience reactions such as anger, anxiety, or frustration as well as reduced enjoyment in social situations, work, and learning environments," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; UBC psychologist Todd Handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some even pursue fewer social activities because of the condition.".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handy began researching misokinesia after a partner told him he was a fidgeter and confessed she felt stress when he fidgeted (or anybody else for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a visual cognitive neuroscientist, this really piqued my interest to find out what is happening in the brain," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the million-dollar question stands: Why do we find fidgeting so annoying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers ran tests to see if people's misokinesia might originate in heightened visual-attentional sensitivities, amounting to an inability to block out distracting events occurring in their visual periphery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results based on early experiments were inconclusive on that front, with the researchers finding no firm evidence that reflexive visual attentional mechanisms substantively contribute to misokinesia sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we're still only at the outset then of exploring where misokinesia may spring from on a cognitive level, the researchers do have some hypothetical leads for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One possibility we want to explore is that their '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron"&gt;mirror neurons&lt;/a&gt;' are at play," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These neurons activate when we move but they also activate when we see others move… For example, when you see someone get hurt, you may wince as well, as their pain is mirrored in your own brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By extension, it's possible that misokinesia-prone people might be unconsciously empathizing with the psychology of fidgeters. And not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A reason that people fidget is because they're anxious or nervous so when individuals who suffer from misokinesia see someone fidgeting, they may mirror it and feel anxious or nervous as well," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to whether that's what's really going on here with misokinesia, only further research into the phenomenon will be able to say for sure. A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0313169"&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Jaswal in 2024 on 21 volunteers found the condition may be linked to challenges in disengaging from a stimulus, rather than about the initial distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain though. From the results seen here, it's clear that this unusual phenomenon is much more usual than we realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To those who are suffering from misokinesia, you are not alone," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;. "Your challenge is common and it's real."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are reported in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This carrot cake smoothie is the perfect way to bring dessert vibes to breakfast! With a mix of carrot juice, banana, cinnamon, ginger and a hint of vanilla, it captures all the cozy flavors of carrot cake in a glass. Pro tip: Always add your liquids to the blender first before the solid ingredients. This creates a fluid base that helps pull the solid ingredients into the blades, ensuring a smooth and creamy consistency.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs in Purgatory, an Italian favorite, involves gently cooking eggs in tomato sauce (with some regional variations) and can fit neatly into breakfast, lunch or dinner. Our rendition features anchovies for an infusion of savory flavor, and baby spinach to pack in extra veggies. Cracking the eggs in a bowl before you slide them into the pan will ensure that you don’t get unwanted shells in the dish and helps keep the yolks from breaking so they remain soft and runny when they blend with the sauce.

There have been 98 cases of the virus in the United States so far this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="according to the CDC" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688a8b5de4b0f5cda486530d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/current-year-data.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a rare disease, but one that folks should be aware of.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Traditionally, the virus is more common in warmer states. “The Southeast has been pretty prominent for West Nile … Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, that type of area, but now we’re seeing cases all over,” said Crumbley. This can be blamed on “continuously changing weather patterns [and] climates,” which make it possible for mosquitoes to show up in new areas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many states are hotter and wetter than ever, and mosquitoes thrive in these conditions, she added, which allows for more virus spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s most commonly seen in the summer to early fall time period,” said &lt;a href="https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/find-a-doctor/s/sachinwalla-eric" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Eric Sachinwalla" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688a8b5de4b0f5cda486530d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.jeffersonhealth.org/find-a-doctor/s/sachinwalla-eric" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Dr. Eric Sachinwalla&lt;/a&gt;, the Medical Director for Jefferson Health’s Infection Prevention and Control in Philadelphia. Now through October or so is when this virus spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;West Nile is spread by mosquitoes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“West Nile virus is ... transmitted by mosquitoes, so similar to other mosquito-borne infections like malaria, things like that,” Sachinwalla added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;West Nile virus is mostly circulated in bird populations, said Crumbley. So when a mosquito bites an infected bird, the mosquito ends up contracting the virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“[West Nile virus] builds up in the mosquito’s body, and then when they bite a person, now we have the virus,” said Crumbley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In order for a person to get West Nile, they have to be bitten by an infected mosquito, added Sachinwalla. It doesn’t spread any other way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you do get infected, there are a few things to know — but thankfully, most folks don’t have to worry about too much.

Most folks don’t even know they have it, Sachinwalla said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people have fever, headaches and body aches.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Twenty percent [to] 30% of people that get exposed might have a nonspecific viral fever illness, so they just feel kind of sick during the summer,” said Sachinwalla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Common symptoms include fever, headache and body aches, he noted. These symptoms last about a week and get better on their own, Sachinwalla said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some folks also report vomiting, diarrhea and, sometimes, a rash, added Ravin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not a communicable disease, said Crumbley. Meaning, someone who has a fever from West Nile can’t pass it on to someone else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In rare cases, there can be severe complications and even death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A very small number of people who end up with symptoms (about 1-2%) end up developing neuroinvasive disease, said Sachinwalla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is what everybody ... probably [is] worried about and reading and hearing more about. It’s a very small number of patients that get this, but that’s where the virus actually can invade and infect the brain or the lining around the brain,” he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This can present as meningitis, encephalitis or something called acute flaccid myelitis, said Ravin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Folks may be confused, very sleepy, have bad headaches or have profound weakness, Sachinwalla said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no specific treatment for West Nile, instead doctors treat it with supportive care, Ravin said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And in about 10% of those cases, you can see patients dying. But overall, that risk is really low when you look at all the people that probably get exposed to West Nile in a given year,” added Sachinwalla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those most at risk of severe complications are older people and those with underlying health conditions, Ravin said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s how you can protect yourself from West Nile, mosquitoes and other mosquito-borne illnesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;West Nile is one of many mosquito-borne illnesses, but protection looks the same whether you’re worried about this virus, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/encephalitis-rare-mosquito-illness_l_66cdfb0ee4b054d2085665e2" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="eastern equine encephalitis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688a8b5de4b0f5cda486530d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="66cdfb0ee4b054d2085665e2" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;eastern equine encephalitis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, another mosquito-borne illness or just itchy bug bites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mosquitoes breed and spend time in areas with stagnant, standing water. This could be ponds, but also bird baths and buckets of water in your backyard, experts told HuffPost. To reduce the number of mosquitoes in your yard, dump standing water, and gather buckets and other items that can collect water before it rains, said Crumbley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Overgrown grass, leaf piles and other similar areas offer hiding places for mosquitoes, Crumbley added. You should maintain these areas in your yard or consider reaching out to a pest control company to come in and treat the area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you are outside, it’s a good idea to wear protective clothing like long sleeves and long pants, Ravin said. Applying insect repellent also helps keep bugs from biting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should make sure you reapply your insect repellent throughout the day and put it on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; sunscreen, added Sachinwalla. “It’s more effective that way,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should also be more cautious during certain times of day; the mosquito that spreads West Nile, known as the Culex mosquito, “typically bites at around dusk and dawn, as far as time during the day. That’s when they’re most active,” said Ravin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do notice concerning symptoms of West Nile, let your doctor know, but a fear of this virus shouldn’t keep you inside in the summer, experts said. Instead, follow safety precautions and stay in touch with your medical provider if you do notice anything off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Roughly 80% are not diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really opens up a lot of new avenues for personalized sleep medicine," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT TO KNOW&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since the FDA approved Zepbound&lt;/strong&gt; to help treat obstructive sleep apnea in some patients with obesity six months ago, Long Islanders have been flooding sleep centers with questions and interest about the medication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts say the drug can help people lose weight&lt;/strong&gt; which may ease the symptoms of their obstructive sleep apnea, but it is not necessarily a cure for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/strong&gt; should speak with sleep medicine experts and undergo an evaluation before starting any new treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also marks another step in the use of the increasingly popular — and pricey — GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) medications to tackle chronic health issues including diabetes, weight management, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said that by losing weight, obese patients may get some relief from their &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459252/" target="_blank"&gt;obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; — a condition in which people stop breathing dozens of times a night because their airway becomes narrowed or blocked when the muscles of the throat relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to these events, the brain sends a signal to wake the person up so they can start breathing again, a cycle that repeats while their sleep. This often leaves them exhausted and unfocused throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="img Image_img__VNXHO landscape lazy"&gt;&lt;img alt="David Warkentin, system director for Catholic Health Sleep Service at..." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANDM4NjM5NDktM2Y4Yi00%3AODViMjM1NTQtMjczMS00%2Fcopy-of-lisleep250720_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=828&amp;amp;q=80 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANDM4NjM5NDktM2Y4Yi00%3AODViMjM1NTQtMjczMS00%2Fcopy-of-lisleep250720_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANDM4NjM5NDktM2Y4Yi00%3AODViMjM1NTQtMjczMS00%2Fcopy-of-lisleep250720_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Warkentin, system director for Catholic Health Sleep Service at St. Charles Hospital in Port Jefferson, outfits a mannequin head with a CPAP mask and EEG electrodes on Thursday. Credit: Newsday/Drew Singh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight can help reduce fatty deposits in the airway, said Dr. Gary Wohlberg, director of the South Shore University Hospital Sleep Center, reducing the chance it will become blocked during sleep. Obese sleep apnea patients may struggle with dieting and exercise and the drug can give them a "head start." In addition, he added, "you really want to change your behavior and it should be coupled with nutritional information and activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Avram Gold, medical director of Stony Brook University’s Sleep Disorders Center, said he is skeptical of the claims that weight loss will make lasting changes for people with obstructive sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can make a difference in how they feel," he said. "But it won’t bring them back to normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond weight loss, the drugs may also be interacting with the body in other ways to reduce sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a theory that some of these drugs, particularly Zepbound, may also reduce inflammation and thereby improve airflow," Wohlberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warkentin said researchers are also looking into whether the drug has a protective effect on brain cells that could improve the brain's ability to regulate breathing during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessing medication can also be challenging for patients. Not all health insurance companies &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/business/wegovy-ozempic-glp1-weight-loss-drugs-gwtq9vrf" target="_blank"&gt;cover weight-loss drugs&lt;/a&gt; and those that do may require participants have a body mass index considered overweight with certain chronic illnesses or be obese. The medicine costs about $1,000 a month for those who must pay out of pocket. Just because Zepbound was approved to treat sleep apnea doesn't guarantee insurance coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A patient's experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in late 2023, Diana Bonilla, 34, of Patchogue was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea, a condition she said started in recent years as she got older and gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wanted to try something other than traditional treatments, which involve use of a continuous positive airway pressure machine, also known as a CPAP machine, or oral appliances worn in a person's mouth while they sleep. People who use CPAP machines wear a mask connected to a machine that sends a stream of pressurized air which keeps the airway from closing during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was going to try weight loss," said Bonilla. "I was at 203 pounds, the heaviest I have ever been. And I’m only 4-foot-11 so that’s a lot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started Zepbound in May 2024 and is down to 134 pounds. Bonilla, an administrative assistant at Northwell Health, said she has more energy, her husband reports she no longer snores, and follow-up tests showed no signs of sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it’s the best thing invented," Bonilla said of the medication. "But you also have to change your eating habits and try to be healthier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warkentin and other sleep medicine experts emphasized Zepbound is not a "magic bullet" and any treatment must look at numerous factors in a person’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone with obstructive sleep apnea is obese. Patients may have physiological issues — such as a large tongue or tonsils — that make breathing during sleep more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight can ease symptoms. However, a person needs sleep tests and to work with specialists to determine the best treatment plan, Warkentin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody’s hoping for that quick fix but it’s a journey," he said. "I think as providers we have to make sure we educate our patients and that we are transparent and we temper expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep apnea warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with sleep apnea may not recognize the warning signs or dismiss them, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Often, people relate their tiredness and fatigue to a lot of other things," said Dr. Andrew Namen, a pulmonologist and sleep apnea expert at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina and a spokesman for the &lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having symptoms like snoring, choking, gasping for breath should alert you to talk to your provider," Namen said. "People think it’s not a serious condition but we now know sleep apnea has been associated with significant heart- and stroke-related events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold said he believes sleep apnea is actually linked to chronic stress and that his research has associated sleep apnea with chronic fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome and, possibly, long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sleep apnea patients who are obese have also tried weight loss surgery to bring down their weight and the extra pressure on their bodies that can make it hard to breathe well while they rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Spronz’s bout with sleep apnea was just part of a lifelong battle with sleep disorders. He had his first sleep test at the age of 14 after years of being on stimulants for the bursts of hyperactivity that came when he wasn’t tired or distracted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They diagnosed him with "REM behavior disorder." Rapid Eye Movement or REM is the stage of sleep that involves dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You act out whatever you are dreaming," said Spronz, 42, a nurse practitioner in psychiatry who lives in Port Jefferson. "You are never actually hitting REM sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep medicine didn’t work and in time he gained weight, going up to 247 pounds. After falling asleep behind the wheel of his car while stopped at a light, Spronz realized he needed more help. Another sleep study led to the use of a CPAP machine, bariatric surgery and use of a weight loss drug that helped him drop 100 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is still following up with treatments due to the complexity of his sleep disorders, and doctors have told him he no longer needs the CPAP machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight was "one piece of the puzzle," Spronz said. "It certainly is not the cure to sleep apnea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

Also, nitric oxide is significant in regulating insulin, which in return affects your blood sugar levels,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="whats-so-bad-about-mouth-breathing" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;What’s So Bad About Mouth Breathing?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;How bad is mouth breathing that people are actually taping their mouths shut? According to one expert, mouth breathing is a bigger problem than you'd expect. “Mouth breathing is wildly unhealthy for any person," says Ben Miraglia, an airway dentist and chief clinical officer at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.toothpillow.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.toothpillow.com/"}' href="https://www.toothpillow.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Toothpillow&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no amount of mouth breathing that is OK.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Mouth breathing can cause issues with sleep and breathing in general. Your nose is designed to filter out debris, allergens, and even tiny insects (thank those nose hairs), and it's designed to give your lungs and throat warmer, more moist air, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22734-mouth-breathing"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Your don’t get these same benefits when you breathe through your mouth. It'll also make you more likely to develop sleep problems like &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Miraglia primarily treats children and approaches airway problems from a youth perspective, including larger dental problems, looking at mouth breathing as a problem overall versus just a sleep problem. From a sleep perspective, the interest in mouth breathing usually comes from sleep problems like snoring and sleep apnea, though getting better air all night long (more moist, less debris, etc.) is obviously a big benefit as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="does-mouth-tape-work" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Do Doctors Recommend Mouth Tape?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If you're coming here after hearing an anecdotal story about how mouth taping has made someone's sleep better, you aren't alone in hearing about mouth tape that way. There are no shortages of these videos online, frequently touting a specific tape they used. But for now, it's mainly personal perspectives supporting the narrative. “There is currently extremely limited clinical evidence to support the efficacy of mouth tape in managing sleep disorders," says Benavides. "One small study from 2022, often cited, looked at 20 people with mild sleep apnea. While these participants showed some improvement with mouth tape, the study didn’t include a placebo comparison, and 20 participants is simply not enough to draw solid conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That's not to say it can never be used. Benavides says he has found use for it, even with his obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Specifically, he has found it useful for OSA patients who want to wear a nasal-only CPAP mask and who could add mouth tape to their nightly setup. "It may help minimize "mouth air leak" (where nasal-entry air escapes through the mouth during therapy) and improve both comfort and adherence. I’ve had success in some individuals," says Benavides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="is-mouth-tape-safe" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Is Mouth Tape Safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;If you can breathe comfortably through your nose, mouth tape should be safe to do. Where it gets dicey is if you're trying to use mouth tape to solve a sleep disorder or breathing problems that your nasal passageways might not be able to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Mouth tape could potentially cause harm in many others. For example, those with moderate to severe sleep apnea may actually find themselves with even more impaired ability to breathe than before. Worse yet, it may further compromise those with central sleep apnea—a different type of apnea disorder,” says Benavides. “Another group to watch out for are those with impaired nasal breathing, as removing the ability to breathe through the mouth severely restricts their remaining—and often much-needed—airflow path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 10:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE45Z2kwWEFXTG1HM25GMzVFZzlUOXVzMi1ETGRkMFNubzVmc3JGUlRHYlhpRk5PT3lCcXdiekNkVTNnU2xWdkttVm0wRVhPLUsybENza0pOV0YzZ1pUQ2tOYUREdTFVdzlKRUE</guid></item><item><title>美国食品和药物管理局的一个小组传播有关怀孕期间使用SSRI的错误信息，使医生感到震惊- NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxNY1ZZeFh3TWpjZ2s0TlFBM1VFUFZyVm5sdjhpLXdhQVJpR0FKZDZKWm9meV9MX2YyNUlWejVZZkxBdjVvNEpQbHMxeVB3aXJEOW9GVnVlSHZ2VDFPODVncGpaRG90Mm5ZMTJEaS1Va3NCcjdtMWNhcDRNUFB3R010VklMQUt5MGt5WGlsSVNIbWh2RmFyNG1TQldwajZaa3A5RW82c1VtdS1FQjJKZlVtZk5OeFE4dXJDUnBaLUQ0UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Doctors are criticizing a recent expert panel organized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that questioned the safety of taking antidepressants during pregnancy.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five pregnant women and new moms in this country &lt;a href="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mental-health-fact-sheet/#ed3bf220-6f23-44db-893a-1beb9664ba04" target="_blank"&gt;suffers from anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;. And 6-8% of pregnant women are prescribed a group of antidepressants called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a recent expert panel organized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cast doubt on the safety of SSRIs — even though these drugs are largely considered safe by healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those comments have sparked a swath of criticism from a number of prominent medical societies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Untreated or undertreated depression during pregnancy carries health risks, such as suicide, preterm birth, preeclampsia, and low birth weight," &lt;a href="https://www.smfm.org/news/smfm-statement-on-ssris-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine &lt;/a&gt;wrote in a statement late last month. "Unfortunately, misinformation about depression and its treatment creates confusion and doubt among patients and the public leading to unnecessary barriers to care."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Opening the panel discussion on FDA on July 21, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said that SSRIs have been "implicated" by studies to be involved in a range of health effects, including pulmonary hypertension and cardiac defects in babies. Then a majority of the panelists, including psychiatrists, psychologists and a social work professor, cited studies they said illustrate serious health risks, like miscarriage and autism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Several groups of healthcare providers, including the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ncrptraining.org/press-release-ncrp-responds-to-fda-panel-on-ssri-use-in-pregnancy/" target="_blank"&gt;National Curriculum for Reproductive Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; have spoken out against many of the claims made by the panel, saying that it misrepresented evidence and spread misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"As experts in high-risk pregnancies, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and its members are alarmed by the unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims made by FDA panelists concerning maternal depression and the use of SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy," according to &lt;a href="https://www.smfm.org/news/smfm-statement-on-ssris-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;the statement from SMFM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Robust evidence" illustrates the safety of SSRI use in pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;according to the ACOG statement&lt;/a&gt;, which added that most of these medications "do not increase the risk of birth defects."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Responding to that criticism, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, Andrew Nixon wrote this to NPR in an email: "The claim that the FDA's expert advisory process is one-sided or politically driven is insulting to the independent scientists, clinicians, and researchers."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Scientific 'apples and oranges' &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the studies cited by the panelists as evidence of harm didn't even involve pregnant and postpartum women, says&lt;a href="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/Jennifer-Payne-1689614604" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Jennifer Payne&lt;/a&gt;, a reproductive psychiatrist at the University of Virginia and a past president of the &lt;a href="https://marcenortham.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Marcé of North America&lt;/a&gt;, an organization working to prevent and treat mental health conditions during and after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, British psychiatrist&lt;a href="https://joannamoncrieff.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Joanna Moncrieff &lt;/a&gt;referenced a study in youth linking SSRIs to increased suicidality in a "very small proportion of" those taking the medication, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Many of the studies referenced by some panelists have been disproven, notes Payne, like the papers linking SSRI use in pregnancy to cardiac defects in infants. "That has been debunked over and over," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And several studies mentioned on the panel were "poorly controlled," says Payne.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So if you're comparing a pregnant patient who was taking an SSRI, the control group should be the pregnant patient with mental health abnormalities who hasn't taken an SSRI," explains &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/about/leadership-and-governance/leadership-team" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Christopher Zahn&lt;/a&gt;, chief of Clinical practice with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or ACOG, who wasn't part of the panel. "And part of the problem with a number of those studies [cited by panelists] is they don't use the right control group. It's really apples and oranges."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And studies that are well-controlled — in other words, those that compare pregnant women on SSRIs with pregnant women with mental health conditions not taking the drugs — do not find the risks highlighted by the FDA panel.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The use of SSRIs in pregnancy is extremely well studied," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/133369" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nancy Byatt&lt;/a&gt;, a perinatal psychiatrist at the UMass Chan School of Medicine. "We have data on hundreds and thousands of individuals exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That data show that by and large, SSRI's are safe. "What the overall data shows is that antidepressants are not associated with major birth defects," says Byatt. And neither are they associated with a significantly higher risk of miscarriage or postpartum hemorrhage, as suggested by some panelists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The impacts of untreated perinatal depression &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One issue that was not discussed enough by the panel, according to Byatt and other experts on perinatal mental health, is the well-documented health impacts of untreated mental health symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Only one panelist, &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/doctors/kay-roussos-ross" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross&lt;/a&gt;, OBGYN and perinatal psychiatrist at the University of Florida, spelled out those impacts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"When mental health conditions go untreated, these women are less likely to attend their prenatal care appointments and they're more likely to use substances during their pregnancy," said Roussos-Ross. "They are also more likely to face additional risks, such as pre-eclampsia and cesarean delivery." They're also at a higher risk of suicide, she said. Mental health remains&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2814936" target="_blank"&gt; the leading cause of maternal deaths &lt;/a&gt;in the United States, including deaths from suicide.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And there's this huge literature on the effects of postpartum depression, on IQ, language development, behavioral problems" in children, says Payne. "It's as clear as a bell that you want mom to be well, during pregnancy and postpartum."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, SSRIs aren't the only treatment option for pregnant and postpartum women, say Payne and others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of tools in our toolbox," says Byatt.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For mild depression or anxiety, the first line of treatment is psychotherapy, or talk therapy, she says. "We have evidence-based psychotherapies that we can, should and do use in pregnancy and postpartum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also psychosocial treatments, like peer support, which can be very helpful in improving pregnant women's and new moms' symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adding practices like exercise, yoga and meditation to those treatments is also something Byatt recommends to her patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Often people can't access therapy quickly because of lack of insurance or even if people do have insurance, it's extraordinarily challenging for people to access evidence-based quality therapy," notes Byatt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So for those women, and ones with moderate to severe symptoms, she says, SSRIs are a helpful option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It turns out that cool temperatures have an individual, dedicated pathway — suggesting the body has different circuits for deciphering warmth and coolness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, published July 28 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1369656233911797118&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-61562-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fwarm-and-cool-temperatures-travel-on-completely-different-paths-to-the-brain-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61562-y" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-61562-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fwarm-and-cool-temperatures-travel-on-completely-different-paths-to-the-brain-study-finds" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the first to map out the pathway for sensing colder temperatures, starting from the skin and ending in the brain.

There, the signals get amplified and passed along, ultimately activating neurons connected to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These temperature-specific sensors on the skin were already known and, in part, earned researchers the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/nobel-prize-in-medicine-won-by-us-scientists-who-unlocked-the-secrets-of-our-sense-of-touch" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/nobel-prize-in-medicine-won-by-us-scientists-who-unlocked-the-secrets-of-our-sense-of-touch"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2021 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that the cool signal gets amplified in the spinal cord, though, is a new discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an experiment, the researchers disabled the cells responsible for this amplification in mice — specialized interneurons — and found that the rodents no longer reacted to cool temperatures. They also saw that these interneurons responded only to cool signals, not to warm or cold stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="next-steps-3"&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By uncovering how these signals are processed in the brain, our research helps build the foundation for protecting and improving this fundamental aspect of human health," Duan said. Notably, this recent study was conducted in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system/scientists-breed-most-human-like-mice-yet" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system/scientists-breed-most-human-like-mice-yet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but Duan said he's confident that the findings are applicable to humans, too. Past research suggests people carry the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959438815000197?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959438815000197?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;same components&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that make up the cool-sensing pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duan and the rest of the team now hope to understand how the newly discovered pathway interacts with other sensory circuits, like those for pain and itch. They also want to learn how disruptions in these systems might contribute to temperature sensitivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To answer these questions, we plan to use advanced imaging techniques and genetic tools to explore this pathway in even greater detail," Duan told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of work may be helpful for pain relief in the context of medical procedures. Some cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, for example, experience &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/cold-allodynia" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/cold-allodynia" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cold allodynia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a condition that makes even mild coolness feel painful. "By understanding the specific circuit for cool sensation, we may be able to develop therapies that target this pathway to reduce such side effects," Duan suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse study is just the first step in mapping these key sensory pathways. "There are still many sensory circuits in the brain that we don't fully understand, and our study is just one example of how mapping them can lead to exciting new discoveries," Duan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body"&gt;Brain quiz: &lt;/a&gt;Test your knowledge of the most complex organ in the body&lt;/h2&gt;

One company is working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;As the number of emergency room visits for tick bite related incidents reaches a five-year high, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one company is working on a new test for Lyme disease that it said can help lead to a more accurate result early in the infection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Auwaerter, a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the clinical director for the infection disease division, said the characteristic rash is usually a reliable indicator of Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, he said, some people who get infected may not develop the rash, instead reporting a fever and feeling unwell, and the standard test isn’t positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a newer, modified two-tier testing process, but Auwaerter said “there’s still much room for improvement.” There’s a window of two to four weeks, when commonly used tests aren’t very accurate because they’re not sensitive enough to pick up the infection, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, people who have been infected for more than four weeks “typically do have positive blood tests to the most frequently used antibody-based test for Lyme disease right now,” Auwaerter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But it’s in this early phase that I think these investigators are purporting that their new approach may yield improved earlier diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acesdiagnostics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ACES Diagnostics&lt;/a&gt; is working on the new test, which uses a type of artificial intelligence called machine-based learning. Holly Ahern, the company’s chief scientific officer, said ‘LymeSeek’ the test uses an algorithm to look at each individual person instead of using a standard interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current tests rely “on those same 10 antigens that they’ve been looking at for the past 40 years,” Ahern said. “Ours uses different antibodies. We’re looking for a whole different set of antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahern and ACES CEO Tammy Crawford said they were motivated to find a new approach after both of their daughters got sick with a mystery illness as teenagers. It became debilitating, and they learned long after the symptoms started that their kids had Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test was developed with assistance from Tulane and Arizona State universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a test that’s accurate early is so important, so that doctors have a tool that can give an actionable result,” Ahern said. “They’ll get a result that says, ‘This patient has Lyme disease.’ And so the next would be, what we do now is prescribe the antibiotic, and hopefully that will prevent long term complications down the line.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company just submitted its clinical plan to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and is meeting with the agency at the end of September. Clinical trials are scheduled to start in January, Crawford said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auwaerter said the bacterial infection is hard to culture, except in labs, so using DNA for PCR “just hasn’t panned out here as being better than antibody tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has fevers or an unexplained illness could consider bringing up the possibility of a tick-borne disease to their doctor, Auwaerter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At least for Lyme disease, early detection of that remains a challenge, so it’s something that may need to be revisited or retested currently, until better tests are available,” Auwaerter said.&lt;/p&gt;
