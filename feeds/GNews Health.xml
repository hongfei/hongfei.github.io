            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN) — &lt;/strong&gt;By now, many people have heard that a diet packed with ultraprocessed foods is not good for us. They have been linked to a host of ills, including obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/14/health/ultraprocessed-food-disease-wellness/index.html"&gt;diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html"&gt;cognitive decline and stroke&lt;/a&gt; — they even appear to increase our &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/health/worst-ultraprocessed-food-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;chance of early death&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00123b6mq8stdh7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultraprocessed foods, according to the &lt;a href="https://ecuphysicians.ecu.edu/wp-content/pv-uploads/sites/78/2021/07/NOVA-Classification-Reference-Sheet.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;NOVA Food Classification system&lt;/a&gt;, are food products made with ingredients you wouldn’t normally find in a supermarket or your kitchen (such as certain individual nutrients, flavor enhancers, colors, additives, stabilizers); they might also be made using &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/01/health/predigested-food-wellness/index.html"&gt;industrial manufacturing processes &lt;/a&gt;(such as extrusion, molding and preprocessing) not available to the home chef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00133b6mkpfzov3x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But anyone who has ever munched on a bag of cheese puffs, heated a frozen pizza for dinner, packed cookies in their kid’s lunch bag or downed a refreshing soda knows these foods can be tasty and convenient. They are also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6558394/" target="_blank"&gt;often cheaper&lt;/a&gt; than making a dish from scratch, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/health/child-addiction-ultraprocessed-foods-wellness/index.html"&gt;hard to resist&lt;/a&gt; (thanks to hyper-palatability formulations) and even harder to avoid: &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1704" target="_blank"&gt;Up to 70% of the US food supply&lt;/a&gt; is made up of ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00143b6mhppyw6xa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet many questions remain: Are they all bad? And exactly what can make them unhealthy. That’s why researchers are asking whether some of those chemicals, additives and flavorings &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness/index.html"&gt;are somehow harmful&lt;/a&gt;? Or do some of these ingredients interact with our bodies through &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/20/health/no-calorie-ultraprocessed-food-depression-wellness/index.html"&gt;our microbiome or our immune system&lt;/a&gt;, unleashing downstream health effects that we don’t yet understand? Or do ultraprocessed foods &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10924027/" target="_blank"&gt;cause us to gain weight,&lt;/a&gt; which in turn sets us up for conditions that are associated with obesity, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l41kc000003b6m25yr3pmq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers like Dr. Kevin Hall, a section chief at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (part of the National Institutes of Health), are trying to find out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00173b6mq306hank@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall and his team authored &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;a groundbreaking study published in 2019&lt;/a&gt;  that found people on an ultraprocessed diet ate on average 500 more calories a day than people on a similar but minimally processed diet (matched for calories offered, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00183b6m3ebi9rpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, Hall and his team &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-us-dietary-guidelines-wellness/index.html"&gt;are conducting a new trial&lt;/a&gt; to try to understand the mechanisms driving people to overconsume calories. He has two theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b00193b6mvneebyj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One is their energy density — so how many calories you’re getting in each gram of food you’re eating,” CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on the Chasing Life podcast. Tirrell visited Hall’s lab to meet one of the participants of his new trial, which (like the first trial) involves living at the NIH for about four weeks and eating diets made up of differently processed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b001a3b6ms3cmh1uw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It so happens that ultraprocessed foods are &lt;a href="https://inddex.nutrition.tufts.edu/data4diets/indicator/percent-energy-comprised-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank"&gt;much more energy-dense&lt;/a&gt; than minimally processed foods,” Tirrell said. “And (Hall) says, really, that’s because they take a lot of the water out of them so that they don’t rot. They’re more shelf stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3938b001b3b6m1biwxw2e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And then the other thing (Hall’s) hypothesizing is their hyper-palatability, or we’ve heard the term the ‘bliss point.’ So, it’s this combination of salt, sugar, fat and carbs in just the right levels that make us not want to stop eating foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm7jfejuj00023b6mfylz499l@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kynsyo000x3b6mssncypnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall’s new trial is studying 36 people, for one month each, cycling them through four diets. “One is minimally processed; one is ultraprocessed — very similar to the first trial: high hyper-palatability, high energy-dense,” Tirrell explained. “And then two other diets … they’re ultraprocessed, but they vary how hyper-palatable they are and how energy-dense they are.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001e3b6m5bsrgsij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And what (Hall’s) trying to see is — can you eat a diet that’s made up mostly of ultraprocessed foods, but that doesn’t drive overeating, and perhaps all of the other health effects of that, if it’s less energy-dense or if it’s less hyper-palatable?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001f3b6mmvcvmaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not everyone views ultraprocessed foods as problematic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001g3b6meb3jrc2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attempting to classify foods as unhealthy simply because they are processed, or demonizing food by ignoring its full nutrient content, misleads consumers and exacerbates health disparities,” Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy at the Consumer Brands Association, said in an emailed statement. CBA is the trade group that represents the US manufacturers of consumer packaged goods, including food and beverages.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001h3b6mqw7vgtji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Companies adhere to the rigorous evidence-based safety standards established by the FDA to deliver safe, affordable and convenient products that consumers depend on every day,” Gallo said. She also noted there is currently no agreed-upon scientific definition of ultraprocessed foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001i3b6masiirad6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tera Fazzino, an associate professor of psychology and the associate director of the Cofrin Logan Center for Addiction Research and Treatment at the University of Kansas, knows a thing or two about ultraprocessed foods and hyper-palatability. She developed a system to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31689013/" target="_blank"&gt;measure the hyper-palatability of different foods&lt;/a&gt;. She also collaborated with Hall and two of his NIH colleagues on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00688-4" target="_blank"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; that found hyper-palatable foods, energy-dense foods and eating rate are all linked to more calories being consumed on four different diets.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001j3b6mquxvuylh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Hyper-palatable foods contain combinations of palatability-related nutrients — so, fat, sugar, sodium and starchy carbohydrates — at thresholds that aren’t typically found together in nature,” she explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001k3b6ml0twcu7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino said hyper-palatable foods activate our brain’s opioid receptors and our dopamine reward neurocircuitry, which leads us to keep eating and seek out more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001l3b6m2sx3kmtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The problem with hyper-palatable foods is, due to their nutrient combinations, they are particularly strong reinforcers,” she said. “They can be acutely rewarding to consume in the moment. And they can also garner a really strong motivational drive for us to continue seeking out and consuming these foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001m3b6md9mpc3ex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino’s research found hyper-palatable foods fall into three categories. “One group has elevated fat and sodium; a second group has elevated fat and sugar. And then the third group has elevated starchy carbohydrates and sodium,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001n3b6mgkuyqbke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat and sodium hyper-palatable foods are a lot of our meal-based items, things that we eat on the regular,” she explained. “That would be meat-based dishes, mixed dishes like meat and mashed potatoes, and things like that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001o3b6m8zdjt6yf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat and sugar (group) really are the sweets, the desserts,” she said. “The starchy carbohydrate and sodium hyper-palatable foods are a lot of our snacks. So, things that maybe even might not seem so problematic or so obvious as maybe (chips), like pretzels (and) most US-produced crackers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001p3b6miiv672x6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino said our bodies haven’t evolved to handle these foods. Whole foods found in nature “activate our brain reward neuro-circuitry and that’s a survival process,” she said. “Eating is fundamentally … a reinforcement-based process, and it needs to be enjoyable to make sure that we survive.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001q3b6mlp70an1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hyper-palatable foods hijack that process because they are engineered to hit &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/health/bliss-point-addictive-food/index.html"&gt;the bliss point&lt;/a&gt; with their magic combination of fat, sugar, sodium and starchy carbohydrates, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001r3b6mcqjl1q8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That is creating almost like this euphoric experience that doesn’t typically come from whole foods,” she explained. “And the problem with that is that that has underlying neurobiological   impacts. It’s excessively activating our brain reward neural circuitry that already happens with whole foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001s3b6maq7i0w21@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why it’s all too easy to overindulge in those foods, she said. “They can cause us to overeat in the moment, but then also there’s this kind of feedback loop where they can become really strong reinforcers and drive our behavior in a way that whole and foundational foods don’t and shouldn’t.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001t3b6mv9dv034m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, these foods are at the heart of the US food supply and have been growing. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37794529/" target="_blank"&gt;One of Fazzino’s studies&lt;/a&gt; found the prevalence of ultraprocessed, hyper-palatable and high energy-dense foods were all significantly higher in 2018 compared with 1988.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001u3b6mxx5365le@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And there is plenty of overlap between the three categories. “When we look at the food supply over time, by the time we get to 2018, we see that the vast majority of ultraprocessed foods are also hyper-palatable,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001v3b6m3zxpc1qt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What can you do to manage the amount of hyper-palatable foods you consume? Fazzino has these five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4oe001w3b6mb712qb05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pay attention to how your food is affecting you as you are eating it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001x3b6mevjjlq4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino suggested this experiment: If you’re eating a bag of potato chips, does your brain tell you, get the next one, get the next one — before you have even swallowed? Or when you’re almost done with the bag, does your body tell you that you want more?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001y3b6mdn759zjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In contrast with, when you eat an apple, none of that extra stuff is going to be happening,” she said. “It’s going to be pleasant and you’re going to stop when you’re full.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of001z3b6ma4wxxzgi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Try to add foods to your diet that are whole and occurring in nature, which means they haven’t had anything done to them, Fazzino said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00203b6mj02v8bzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whole foods that occur in nature, Fazzino said, typically have “one palatability-related nutrient,” such as the sugar in a whole apple.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00213b6mxu2oy3c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those whole foods also include “satiety-promoting nutrients such as fiber, water and protein that slow their absorption and digestion into our system,” she said, noting that they won’t cause us to overeat or create a strong motivational drive to seek them out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00223b6mu8ubsauo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pay attention to the amount of salt in foods.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00233b6m8g1x96hz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One really robust commonality that we found in this work has been the presence of sodium as a nutrient that, when combined with either fat or starchy carbohydrates, can really be a vehicle for hyper-palatability,” Fazzino said, explaining that sodium “activates the opioid system in the brain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00243b6m0bg2gwev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We are often told to reduce sodium overall for our heart health, she said, but salt is not as well-known for contributing to hyper-palatability as fat and sugar are.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00253b6msaq91dgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no magic sodium number or threshold used to determine whether the amount of salt in a particular food contributes to hyper-palatability. But Fazzino recommends people look for low-sodium options in the cracker aisle or the frozen dinner section, for example.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00263b6mudvet2ei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fazzino also encouraged home cooks to keep sodium in mind, since a lot of ingredients have added salt. (Be mindful of the butter, cheese and sausage bits you may be adding to your omelet.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00273b6mkhy0btka@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Go light on what you add,” she said. “That will help to avoid the hyper-palatability piece.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00283b6mxrrezemw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stay away from food labels touting properties such as “diet,” “reduced fat” or “lean,” Fazzino recommended.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of00293b6m13eot0i5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of the diet foods, as we found in our analysis of the food system, are hyper-palatable,” she said. Without the bliss point engineering, she noted, those foods would not be as palatable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002a3b6mn3vlu917@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And when one key ingredient is reduced, another is often increased. These food products are marketed with less fat, for example, but maybe they contain more added sugar, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7l3a5dd002j3b6mplbveb2f@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understand-the-deck-is-stacked-against-you" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understand the deck is stacked against you
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002b3b6miqzplb23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Be aware that hyper-palatable foods are designed to entice you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002c3b6mlz8w7sk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re designed to be difficult to resist and difficult to stop eating Fazzino said. “And it’s not the individual’s fault.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7l3a4of002d3b6mwqhh0nij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, Fazzino said systemic changes may be needed to meaningfully address the prevalence of these foods in the food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7kyhmip000m3b6mykktjlig@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

That recognition is prompting some of them to question whether the long-standing practice of culling every single bird on an infected farm is sustainable over the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Instead, they are discussing such strategies as targeted depopulation, vaccinations, and even the relocation of wetlands and bodies of water to lure virus-carrying wild birds away from poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But each of these alternatives entails a variety of logistical, economic and environmental costs that may eclipse the intended savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"People talk about common-sense solutions to bird flu," said &lt;a href="https://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/maurice-ernest-pitesky" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Maurice Pitesky;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Maurice Pitesky&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian and commercial poultry expert at UC Davis.

The virus produces a gastrointestinal infection, so the birds wind up dying of diarrhea along with respiratory distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s like Ebola without the hemorrhage,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-04-18/avian-flu-outbreak-raises-a-disturbing-question-is-our-food-system-built-on-poop?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=promo_module&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss_feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Avian flu outbreak raises a disturbing question: Is our food system built on poop?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Avian flu outbreak raises a disturbing question: Is our food system built on poop?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sparing birds that don't look sick is a gamble.

The only way to know for sure is to test each bird individually — an expensive and time-consuming prospect. And if even a single infected bird is missed, it can spread the virus to an entire flock of replacements, Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Besides, she said, all of the extra work that would go into making sure some chickens can stay alive would only drive up labor costs and ultimately make eggs more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It also has the potential to increase the total amount of virus on farms, which is dangerous for human poultry workers, said &lt;a href="https://dean.sph.brown.edu/dean" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Ashish Jha;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Ashish Jha&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“One of the reasons to cull early is that you don’t want a lot of bird-human exposures,” he said. “The more infections we introduce to humans, the more mutations we’re going to see that increase the risk for a broader epidemic or pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-24/restrictions-on-gain-of-function-research-have-hobbled-h5n1-bird-flu-fight?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=promo_module&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss_feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why scientists say we are fighting H5N1 bird flu with one hand tied behind our backs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Why scientists say we are fighting H5N1 bird flu with one hand tied behind our backs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For all of these reasons, international trade agreements require mass culling — also known as "stamping out" — so that importers don't get a side of H5N1 with their poultry, said &lt;a href="https://vetmed.umn.edu/bio/college-of-veterinary-medicine/carol-cardona" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Carol Cardona;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Carol Cardona&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a veterinarian and avian influenza researcher at the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That's not the only financial incentive for mass culling.

Risks could be reduced further by requiring workers to change their clothes and boots when moving from barn to barn, or by assigning workers to a single barn, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-06/first-us-h5n1-bird-flu-death?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=promo_module&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rss_feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:First U.S. fatality from bird flu reported in Louisiana;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;First U.S. fatality from bird flu reported in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But others, including Dr. John Korslund, a veterinarian and former USDA researcher, are skeptical that such a practice could work, considering the virulence of H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Chickens are infected and shedding virus very early, often before visible evidence of clinical illness," Korslund said.

"A lot of additional virus will be put into the environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Indeed, flu particles from one facility can escape exhaust fans and travel great distances, said &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michael Osterholm;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

And most will blackball a nation's entire poultry portfolio, even if just one region or type of poultry is infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The U.S. exports more than &lt;a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/about-the-industry/statistics/u-s-broiler-exports-quantity-and-share-of-production/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:6.7 billion pounds of chicken meat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;6.7 billion pounds of chicken meat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; each year, &lt;a href="https://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/statistic/broiler-industry-key-facts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:second only to Brazil;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;u&gt;second only to Brazil&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Chicken Council.

			&lt;p&gt;When it comes to surviving radiation, tardigrades really know their stuff, shrugging off doses that would annihilate most other life forms. Now researchers are using this knowledge to find ways to protect healthy cells during  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="153279" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team led by Ameya Kirtane from Harvard Medical School and Jianling Bi from the University of Iowa has isolated this superpower in the form of messenger RNA, which when injected into cells protects them from radiation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people undergo radiotherapy for cancer, it's not just the tumor that suffers. The radiation causes DNA breaks in healthy cells, too, leading to massive cell death and inflammation, which is responsible for the treatment's unpleasant side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It can manifest as something as simple as mouth sores, which can limit a person's ability to eat because it's so painful, to requiring hospitalization because people are suffering so terribly from the pain, weight loss, or bleeding," University of Iowa radiation oncologist James Byrne&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite their cute monikers like moss piglet and water bear, the microscopic, eight-legged animals known as tardigrades are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-adorable-little-animals-will-survive-nearly-any-global-apocalypse"&gt;&lt;span&gt;notoriously tough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Aside from surviving the hottest setting of your oven and pressures of 7.5 Gpa, they can handle &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770827/"&gt;around a thousand times&lt;/a&gt; the dose of ionizing radiation that would kill a human. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can do this because of their ability to produce a unique protein Dsup (short for 'damage suppressing'), which helps them tolerate both the initial blast and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-figured-out-how-tardigrades-survive-x-ray-bombardment"&gt;hydroxyl radicals&lt;/a&gt; that form in cells as a result, which would otherwise tear up one or even both strands of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-figured-out-how-tardigrades-survive-x-ray-bombardment"&gt;had their eyes on this protein&lt;/a&gt; as a potential aid to cancer treatment since &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12808"&gt;it was discovered in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and now they're one step closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-3uNVu6sqk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 2016 study showed that when expressed in human cells, Dsup reduces X-ray-induced DNA damage by about 40 percent, which is why the researchers are hopeful it could protect cancer patients from the serious side-effects of their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Dsup has to be inside a cell's nucleus to work. Delivering this protein directly into each cell is not feasible, and integrating the genes for Dsup directly into DNA has its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the strengths of our approach is that we are using a messenger RNA, which just temporarily expresses the protein, so it's considered far safer than something like DNA, which may be incorporated into the cells' genome," Kirtane &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By wrapping the mRNA in specific polymer-lipid nanoparticles (one design best-suited to the colon, and one ideal for the mouth) they were able to smuggle the strands into lab-grown cells where they were used to generate large amounts of Dsup before disintegrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We thought that perhaps by combining these two systems – polymers and lipids – we may be able to get the best of both worlds and get highly potent RNA delivery. And that's essentially what we saw," Kirtane &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074707?"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, delivering the Dsup in mRNA 'recipe' format also prevents the protective tardigrade armor from sneaking their way into cells the radiation is supposed to kill, such as those making up the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make sure this works in action, the team injected Dsup-encoding mRNA into mice who, 6 hours later, received a dose of radiation roughly equivalent to one that might be administered to a human cancer patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One group of mice received mRNA treatment and radiation to the mouth; the other, to the rectum. And some extra mice were given the radiation without the protection of Dsup, to provide a baseline for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153378" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153378" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation.png" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-153378" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation.png 1992w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-642x267.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-998x415.png 998w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-768x319.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-1536x638.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/tardigrade-dna-for-radiation-600x249.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1992px) 100vw, 1992px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153378" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;It's still a long way off human use, but the delivery of tardigrade Dsup protein mRNA shows promise. (Kirtane et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'rectal' group experienced about half as many radiation-induced double-stranded DNA breaks, compared with controls that did not receive Dsup protection. The 'mouth' group had about one third of the breaks of their peers. And the mRNA treatment seemed to have no effect on tumor volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is just the beginning: the sample sizes were very small, and of course, we can't predict how human bodies will react to a treatment based solely on tests on lab-grown cells or mice. But it's enough to prompt further investigation, especially now they know they can get the mRNA safely into a cell without conferring the benefit on the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The use of Dsup mRNA delivery may be co-opted for several other clinical applications, including protection of normal tissue from DNA-damaging chemotherapies or progressive degeneration of specific tissues, cancer predisposition, chromosomal instability and hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents," the authors &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01360-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition to cancer-related applications, the use of Dsup protein can be extended to total body exposure to space radiation or as prophylaxis against nuclear radiation exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01360-5"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A 2022 study led by academics at Imperial College London suggests almost 20million lives were saved by Covid vaccines in the first year since countries began rolling out the jabs, the majority in wealthy nations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes symptoms like fatigue, fever, and rashes, and once symptoms disappear, the virus remains dormant in the body, where it can be reactivated when the immune system is low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the Yale team collected blood samples of 42 Americans with PVS and 22 without it, between December 2022 and November 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with the syndrome were generally in poorer health than the average American, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most complaining of the symptoms developed them after their first or second Covid vaccine, with some experiencing an onset after a third or fourth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The levels in PVS patients were even greater than those found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14255465/doctors-relief-long-covid-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a condition with similar symptoms linked to the virus itself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Persistent spike proteins in the body are thought to cause some of long Covid's symptoms, by keeping the body in a constant state of inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Akiko Iwasaki, the lead researcher behind the paper, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14421799/yale-scientists-covid-vaccine-study-message-victims.html"&gt;told DailyMail.com&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People with PVS also had elevated levels of Covid spike proteins.

There is a problem with this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at a moment right now where the US government is undercutting people's trust in science and vaccinations probably like never before in history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And to coin this novel syndrome without even proving that it's caused by the vaccine is very worrisome to me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mRNA Covid vaccines are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;estimated to have saved tens of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10944873/Covid-vaccines-saved-nearly-20MILLION-lives-year-worlds-roll-out.html"&gt;millions of lives globally from Covid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;1.6million in Europe and 3million in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They are also credited with helping end the series of paralyzing lockdowns brought on by the Covid pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC still recommends Covid vaccines, especially for those who are elderly or immunocompromised and vulnerable to the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid is also still &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-8239461/Confirmed-coronavirus-cases-surpass-800-000-death-toll-hits-42-940.html" class=""&gt;killing about 300 Americans every week&lt;/a&gt;, CDC data shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid vaccines are not currently available in the UK via the NHS, though they are expected to roll out again in the spring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn't the first mRNA jabs have been linked to worrying side effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Global reports of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12339279/Covid-vaccine-myocarditis-heart-Elon-Musk-bronny-james.html"&gt;myocarditis&lt;/a&gt;, a potentially dangerous inflammation of the heart muscle, have also spooked health officials in the US and UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In myocarditis, it's thought that the immune system may register mRNA in Covid vaccines as a threat, leading the immune system to attack itself and cause inflammation of the myocardium, the heart's muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This same mechanism has been linked to pericarditis, which leads to inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both conditions have been linked to viruses like the common cold and hepatitis, as well as Covid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most cases are mild, in rare instances, myocarditis can damage the heart and make it difficult for it to pump blood, eventually leading to heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found rates of myocarditis in Britain were eventually found to be lower than in the US and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts attributed this to the UK's longer intervals between doses, eight weeks compared to four, which is said to give the body more time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the &lt;span&gt;side effect is rare but exactly how rare is still being debated. Estimates range from one in 50,000 to one in 200,000. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data also showed that the risk of myocarditis from Covid itself was far higher than that from a vaccine, so experts continued to recommend the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no figures for the number of PVS patients in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Trevor Keyler, a biology professor in Minnesota, was an avid mountain biker when he developed cataracts and tremors after his Moderna vaccine.

She is pictured at left before the injury and at right after&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, government data has recorded the number of people applying for compensation for injuries and deaths they believe to be caused by the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest figures, published by Parliament last month, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14416803/covid-vaccine-injury-risk-harm-killed-Brits-new-syndrome.html"&gt;show a total of 17,379&lt;/a&gt; applications had been made to the UK's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme as of November last year, with at least 70 of these related to deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, just 194 have been deemed eligible for payment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The controversial scheme predates the Covid shots and offers some victims of vaccine injuries and deaths a one-off payment of £120,000 (about $150,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 9,196 rejected claims, 416 were done so on the grounds that, while a victim had been injured by a vaccine, they didn't meet the 60 percent disability threshold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a further 7,173 victims, or their families, are still awaiting a verdict, meaning the totals could still rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, data from the US Covid vaccine injury compensation program suggested that 14,000 people had filed claims for injury or death they claimed were caused by the vaccine as of December 2024, out of the 270million Americans who received at least one dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But only one in four claims have been reviewed, according to the Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration, an agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those reviewed, 58 are 'eligible for compensation.' In order to be eligible, a person must be able to prove their injury was directly caused by a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But that's not the only bad news. Scientists have also detected bird flu in three veterinarians working with cattle, which may signal a change in the way the virus is spreading.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the university, three veterinarians working with cattle have tested positive for bird flu without presenting any symptoms. In a separate statement, the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/study-three-bovine-veterinarians-unknowingly-infected-h5n1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association said&lt;/a&gt; a study found that "Among 150 practitioners tested, three had evidence of recent infection with H5N1, including two who hadn’t been exposed to animals confirmed or suspected to have H5N1 infections." One of those infected vets didn't even practice in a state with a confirmed H5N1 case. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sarah Michaels, an infectious disease expert at Tulane University’s Celia Scott Weatherhead School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, says this study and others could indicate that the virus is far more widespread than we thought. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It will be difficult to contain,” Michaels said. “Recent screenings and the national milk testing program have shown that bird flu has spilled over from wild birds to cattle more than once. And this report of infections in three veterinarians highlights the importance of rapidly identifying infected dairy cattle, continued testing of bulk milk, and monitoring human infections among those at increased risk.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for the new strain, it's known as the D1.1 variant, which Tulane explained had only been previously found in wild birds and some domestic poultry. However, now, it's not only been found in cattle but also in a Nevada dairy worker, marking the third known human case involving the variant. This follows two other high-profile cases with D1.1, including the death of a Louisiana farmer who contracted it from his backyard flock and a teenager in Canada who was hospitalized but later recovered. And now that that are two types of the virus out there, experts say it will be hard to both track and contain the spread. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s endemic in cows now. There is no way this is going to get contained,” Seema Lakdawala, an influenza virologist and co-director of the Center for Transmission of Airborne Pathogens at Emory School of Medicine, shared with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding fuel to the fire is the absolutely rampant spread of the flu in humans this winter. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20there%20have,flu%20so%20far%20this%20season." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) reported that there have been "at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths from flu so far this season," marking one of the worst flu seasons in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/usmap.html" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;over a decade&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There’s a lot of flu going around, and so the potential for the virus to reassort right now is high,” Lakdawala additionally told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, noting there is the possibility of "reassortment" in animals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While all this is really great, things could be worse than we know, as the Trump administration has halted communication with the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/29/nx-s1-5276340/trump-centers-for-disease-control-cdc-world-health-organization" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, which is no longer receiving updates on either human flu or avian influenza.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There’s no way Americans can protect themselves from bird flu unless the Trump administration stops recklessly withholding the latest information on where and how it’s spreading,” Hannah Connor, deputy environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity, &lt;a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/cdc-urged-to-release-bird-flu-data-as-trump-slashes-key-staff-combatting-outbreak-2025-02-24/#:~:text=Under%20Trump%20the%20CDC%20has,Morbidity%20and%20Mortality%20Weekly%20Report." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shared in a letter co-signed by 28 public interest groups&lt;/a&gt;. “The most effective way to slow an outbreak of this magnitude is to routinely keep us all well informed.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As for what you can do to protect yourself, Michaels noted that “Eggs and meat should be cooked thoroughly, and people should refrain from drinking raw milk." Emily Landon, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Chicago Medicine, echoed this sentiment in her own university's statement, noting that while the risk to humans remains is low, it's still important to stay vigilant. “The highest risk to most people would be through contaminated dairy products,” Landon noted. So, for now, it's best to avoid raw milk and unpasteurized cheese. This also goes for your pets. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As always, you should avoid contact with infected animals and wash your hands frequently if you do come in contact with any farm animals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And all the experts agreed that if you haven't received a flu shot this year, you should consider getting one for yourself or the kids in your life.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Sue Bell became one of the first Alzheimer's patients in the U.S. to receive the drug now marketed as Leqembi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Four years later, she and her husband, Ken, halted the treatment. Sue's Alzheimer's had reached the point where her taking the drug no longer made sense.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it helped," says her husband, Ken Bell. "But I'm not sure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That sort of uncertainty is common when it comes to&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-alzheimers-disease-treatment" target="_blank"&gt; Leqembi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/news-events-human-drugs/fda-approves-treatment-adults-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Kisunla&lt;/a&gt;, two new Alzheimer's drugs approved since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both drugs clear the brain of a substance called beta-amyloid, which forms the sticky plaques associated with Alzheimer's. Studies show they can slow down the underlying disease process that ultimately leads to the death of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But neither drug restores memory and cognition, and the benefit to a given person varies widely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Some people progress, other people do pretty well," says&lt;a href="https://physicians.wustl.edu/people/barbara-joy-snider-md-phd/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Joy Snider&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neurology and one of Sue's doctors at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Both drugs also cost more than $25,000 a year, and can cause brain swelling and bleeding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A diagnosis and a drug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue began having memory problems around 2019, when she was working as a substitute teacher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She'd come home and she'd say, I'm having trouble spelling words and things like that," Ken told me when I visited the couple in 2023 at their home in St. Charles, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I didn't remember all that," Sue added. "That's part of the problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue saw her primary care doctor, then a neurologist. She got cognitive tests, brain scans, and, eventually, a diagnosis: early stage Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Sue volunteered for a study at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Researchers there were conducting part of a nationwide clinical trial of Leqembi, then known by its generic name, lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug was the latest in a series of medications designed to clear the brain of beta-amyloid, which forms the sticky plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's. At the time, none of those drugs had been shown to slow the loss of memory and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Sue and Ken knew lecanemab was unlikely to help her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm the kind of person that I would like to help somebody else, too." Sue said during my 2023 visit. "And that's what I was in this for."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ken hoped that if lecanemab worked even a little, "at some point maybe they would come up with something that would either reverse the symptoms or cure it even."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infusions and hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue and Ken began making twice-monthly trips to St. Louis, about 30 minutes away, where she got lecanemab by intravenous infusion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Needles don't bother me," she said, adding that she didn't experience the brain swelling or bleeding that can be side effects of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the drug seemed to help. Sue was able to take a trip to New York.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was a great trip. We had five girls," Sue said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was really six girls," Ken added softly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Oh I forgot that," Sue said. "It was very fun. We just walked all over the place."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved lecanemab/Leqembi for treating people in the earliest stage of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By then, though, Sue knew her memory was getting worse, despite the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Oh, it's waning," she said at the time. "Some days I'm better than others."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Ken and Sue kept driving from St. Charles to St. Louis for her lecanemab infusions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-49460" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ending treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, I got an update during a video call with Ken — but not Sue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I didn't think it would help to have her participate today, honestly," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tests had shown that Sue's memory and thinking had declined to the point where lecanemab was no longer a good option.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We decided that we were kind of wasting our time coming down there all the time," Ken said. "So we suspended taking the drugs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So have many other patients in the clinical trial of lecanemab, says Snider, the Washington University neurologist who oversaw Sue's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a few people left from that study who are still on the medication," She says. "I am surprised at how well some of them are doing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For all of its limitations, Snider says, Leqembi represents a meaningful change in Alzheimer's treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People like Sue and Ken are the reason we have a new drug, and the reason we can give hope to a lot of people with this disease," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Sue, though, hope is fading.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She still knows me, still knows our kids," Ken says. But some days, he adds, she gets lost in her own house.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On one of those days, Sue began asking Ken to move her to a care home. So Ken found one she liked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After she was there a few days, every time I would come she would say take me back home, I don't want to be here anymore," Ken says. "After a month, I brought her back home."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sue is still at home, when she's not at a daycare for people with memory problems. Two days a week, Ken gets help from in-home care providers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But at some point, Ken says, his wife will probably need more care than he can arrange at home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Normal skin bacteria &lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2021/december/microbial-origins-of-body-odor"&gt;break down the sweat&lt;/a&gt; into short chain fatty acids, which emit that unpleasant smell.

Some people on social media have opted for antibacterial washes containing &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdrayzday/video/7365302287595670830?lang=en&amp;amp;q=chlorhexidine%20armpit&amp;amp;t=1740378610036"&gt;benzoyl peroxide or chlorhexidine&lt;/a&gt;, products with glycolic acid or straight &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylimomma/video/7297412946722934059?lang=en&amp;amp;q=alcohol%20armpit&amp;amp;t=1740379242531"&gt;isopropyl alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, all of which “can help with odor, but will not block sweat. They can also be irritating to the skin,” said &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/slipner"&gt;Shari Lipner&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of clinical dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CWRKNFOCIZB4HGLX2IPOJAY2ME" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CWRKNFOCIZB4HGLX2IPOJAY2ME"&gt;What else you should know:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WRGGCFSM25FZFONVQPLHRZJZXY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Choosing a deodorant, antiperspirant or alternative method for underarm odor control is a personal decision, but here are some shopping suggestions from dermatologists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="W4W2EUQ56BGJNJEAPHJ2YJIXKM" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Determine what type you need.&lt;/b&gt; Deodorants control body odor, and antiperspirants reduce sweating, which then helps to cut down on body odor. Many products include both. “I generally recommend a combined antiperspirant deodorant in a stick format,” Lipner said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decide which formulation works best for you&lt;/b&gt;. Sticks provide controlled application and more complete coverage, as do gels and roll-ons, though the latter two often go on wet and need several seconds to dry. Sprays are quick, easy and absorb well, but Garshick noted that some people do not want “to breathe in the aerosol spray” during the application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider any allergies or sensitivities&lt;/b&gt;. People who have sensitive skin may opt for deodorant products without potential irritants such as alcohol, fragrances or certain preservatives, Friedman said. While he does not consider them effective, aluminum-free options with more plant-based ingredients are available, he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WHSNCRRPM5B57DLG234SAY42SM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have concerns, such as  allergies to certain ingredients, speak with a dermatologist about which product or method would work best for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="JTHETOIHXZCZPCVHHMTWVX3UE4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="JTHETOIHXZCZPCVHHMTWVX3UE4"&gt;The bottom line:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BCOZBPMNCFEDZJPHISOREZWKEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Antiperspirants, in particular, should be applied at bedtime. When applied at night when sweat production is decreased, the aluminum-based compounds in antiperspirants are better able to plug the sweat ducts to reduce perspiration the next day.

&lt;p&gt;Eighty-four members of Congress have written to President Trump expressing concerns about his actions regarding the CDC and USDA that will negatively impact the nation’s ability to ensure that bird flu does not become widespread among people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;United States Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-CT, leads the 83 other lawmakers in the effort to change the president’s mind about measures he has taken that they believe will hamper the U.S. Department of Agruculture’s and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s efforts in containing bird flu, also known as H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus has already infected 70 people and killed one. More than 970 dairy herds in the United States have been infected and the virus has resulted in the culling of more than 157 million commercial poultry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since becoming president, Trump has restricted communication between the CDC and the USDA, making it impossible for the agencies to collaborate on the nation’s response to bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most effective way to cut through agency bureaucracy, which you claim to be in favor of, would be to increase agency communication with Congress, stakeholders, and the public,” the lawmakers’ letter states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus has already mutated, with a second strain infecting a dairy herd in Nevada. So far, human H5N1 infections have largely led to mild illnesses, according to the lawmakers, however the two cases of severe illness in North America were associated with this new variant, including a Louisiana resident who died, and a British Columbia teen who was in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Failure to restore full interagency information sharing and public health communications continues to harm the U.S. Response to H5N1,” according to the members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a statement about the lawmakers’ letter to the president, DeLauro said the gag order has harmed the response to prevent the spread of H5N1, and the government must be allowed to resume interagency communications and the sharing of critical public health information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your Administration must act quickly to address this crisis,” the lawmakers wrote. “Viruses will not wait for this Administration to lift its gag order or for agencies to restart their collaboration and information sharing before they spread or mutate. It is clear that these interfering short-sighted actions by your Administration will cause significant harm. This interference must end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We know you would not like to see another deadly pandemic unfold under your watch. [T]hus, we await your swift action to completely lift the pause on external communications by public health agencies, commit to cross-agency collaboration on H5N1, and work to get every necessary state enrolled in the National Milk Testing Strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, the USDA confirmed that it fired several agency employees working on the federal response to H5N1. The Administration “prioritizing” their bird flu response and firing of federal employees actively working on this worsening outbreak cannot both coexist, according to the lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The members of Congress also asked President Trump to encourage all states to engage in the National Milk Testing Strategy (NMTS) to facilitate comprehensive H5N1 detection in the nation’s milk supply. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to sending their letter to President Trump, the lawmakers copied Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins. &lt;/p&gt;

She watched patients die alone and missed her son's birthday out of fear of becoming infected and bringing the virus home with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2021, Covid vaccines became available and, feeling a sense of duty to protect her patients, she took the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-cdcb3010-f3aa-11ef-8125-0bb3f6a87bc2"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She experienced no immediate side effects, but in July 2021, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14418267/Vaccine-victims-left-disabled-taking-Covid-jab-react-bombshell-Yale-study-shots-cause-extreme-body-changes.html"&gt;Mrs Burnette developed 'unbearable' pain&lt;/a&gt; in both of her hips. She was told she had arthritis at 31 years old and had to use a wheelchair when the pain made it too hard to walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Believing her pain was something else, another doctor ordered an MRI, which revealed Mrs Burnette's hip bones were literally rotting, and she underwent her first hip replacement in December 2021. The second followed a few months later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, her hips were just the beginning. Over the next nearly four years - and still ongoing today - Mrs Burnette would undergo surgeries on both shoulders and knees, three surgeries on her elbow, one on her left foot and she is scheduled to have another procedure on her right foot next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About a year after her ordeal began, one of her doctors attributed her complications to her bout of Covid in late November 2020 and subsequent vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brittany Burnette lives in Tennessee with her husband and two sons (pictured here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette told DailyMail.com: 'The pain is so debilitating. I have never felt so helpless in my entire life. I've always been trying to be the best provider I could be caring for other people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, due to Mrs Burnette's condition, she had to quit her job as a nurse and director in an elder care home and go on disability.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'Now I can't even drive my kids to school in the morning anymore... it's devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have really had to mourn the life that I thought I was going to have because I will no longer be able to be the same person I've always wanted to be because of a virus and a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette, now 34, used to be a nurse and director in a nursing home but has had to go on disability because of her medical complications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's absolutely destroyed my life, and so I've had to just totally sit back and reevaluate everything.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like thousands of Americans who suffered injuries shortly after getting their Covid vaccine, Mrs Burnette attributes her ailments to the shot. But a lack of research and evidence has left vaccine victims without answers, lacking support and being cast as anti-vaxxers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, last week, a small Yale University study offered some support to victims' stories as experts discovered a previously-unknown condition - dubbed 'post-vaccination syndrome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms include brain fog, dizziness, tinnitus and exercise intolerance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition also appears to reawaken a dormant virus in the body called Epstein-Barr, which can cause flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes and nerve issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Burnette's symptoms don't match all of those mentioned in the research - she has experienced nerve complications - the researchers said vaccine injuries can manifest differently from patient to patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette told DailyMail.com she remains a supporter of vaccines and she and her children have all received routine shots, but she is hesitant to get new ones going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the hardest things about her complications is the impact it has on her as a mother. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette's pain is so severe she is often reliant on a wheelchair to get around&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'I worry every day that I'm going to cause [my sons] to have stress and anxiety when they're older but they have made me feel so strong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel like, if anything, this just made them so much more compassionate. They are always always there no matter what, at my back to take care of me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My 10 year old has really stepped up and my husband, he works very hard for us, especially with me losing [my job]. He's really been an amazing caretaker and taken over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just don't know if I would have made it. They are the reason I keep going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to her vaccine, Mrs Burnette had been living with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - thickening of the heart muscle - but her condition was well managed under the care of a cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her new symptoms began, she has seen doctors across multiple specialties, including orthopedics and a geneticist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website her geneticist attributes her complications to a combination of her Covid infection and the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor, Mrs Burnette said, told her when she received the vaccine it prompted an immune response and her body sent out thousands of clots that cut off the blood supply to her bones and joints and cause them to collapse and die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of Mrs Burnette's other doctors believe she has the autoimmune diseases either lupus or rheumatoid arthritis but diagnostic tests have come back negative or inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette has undergone three surgeries on her elbow to remove dead bone and repair a nerve (left) and has had both of her knees replaced (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has been diagnosed with multifocal avascular necrosis (AVN), also called multifocal osteonecrosis (MFON). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AVN is a condition in which bones throughout the body lose their blood supply, causing them to die. It can be caused by trauma to the body, like broken or fractured bones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2023 &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://journals.lww.com/annals-of-medicine-and-surgery/fulltext/2023/09000/avascular_necrosis_of_femoral_head_following.5.aspx"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;in the journal Annals of Medicine and Surgery investigated the relationship of avascular necrosis (AVN) and Covid infection in 17 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found 82 percent of patients complained of pain in both hips, leading nearly 18 percent to undergo total hip replacements and they concluded 'there is a risk of developing AVN after Covid-19.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no published research on the connection between AVN and Covid vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brandson Crawford, a functional neurologist who is not involved in Mrs Burnette's care, told DailyMail.com AVN can be triggered by inflammation and blood clotting abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These, Dr Crawford said, have been documented both in severe Covid cases and post-vaccination adverse reactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'Given that Covid-19 is known to affect the vascular system and trigger inflammatory responses, it is plausible that a vaccine administered soon after an infection could further exacerbate these effects, particularly in individuals with underlying predispositions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Burnette is pictured above receiving her Covid vaccine in January 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her hip replacements, Mrs Burnette has also undergone a partial left shoulder replacement in September 2022 and had three surgeries on her elbow to remove dead bone and repair a nerve in January 2023, August 2024 and November 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She underwent a right knee replacement in August 2023, a partial right shoulder replacement in May 2023, a left knee replacement in February 2023 and in July 2023 her left heel broke and had to be surgically repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette will undergo surgery in the next few weeks to repair another fracture in her right foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website: 'Even though I have had all of these replacements and surgeries I am still in constant deep bone pain every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It isn't as bad as bone death pain but some days are still unbearable. The pain is so bad some days it takes everything I have to get out of bed and move, let alone be a mother and wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Doctors] think I will likely suffer with bone pain for the rest of my life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only has she had to cope with AVN, her doctors said the infection and vaccine triggered a 'domino effect' in her body, leading to blood clots in her lungs, declining kidney function, sepsis and pleurisy - inflammation of the lining in the lungs and chest cavity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is an x-ray showing Mrs Burnette's double hip replacements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In an alternative effort to treat her ailments, doctors have prescribed chemotherapy and immunotherapy infusions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'I'm not going to tell you I haven't had dark, scary days and struggle, because I have... without my family and God, I just don't know. That's just what kept me going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Mrs Burnette believes in vaccines, when she first started speaking out about her experience with the Covid shot, she said she was met with people questioning whether she was an anti-vaxxer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mrs Burnette has always been pro-vaccine and she and her children received all the recommended shots. Now, however, she is extremely wary of new ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told this website she will never get or give her children another Covid vaccine, but has no problem getting them routine vaccinations of shots that have been around and researched for decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Burnette said: 'I did everything that I needed to do, vaccinating my children. I was vaccinated, but, I will never get another flu shot or COVID vaccine, and I won't give my kids either as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They will get... the other ones that have been well studied and researched, and there's lots of information on over the years. I just think that newer vaccines, before mandated, need to be researched because these are people's lives that it's destroying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 03:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPUlV0ZUFzQzJmaEpZd0MybVdUSURmSXM2WTBHNDRSZnVBaENTbmdKbkd6Wkh0cU5ESnVYOXdhZThpLVEtTll5MFpTMXNqZ3luT2tKSlM2N0FNZ3ZLSUxiVmVZMjg0RnQ5WWNpOGFzWmJGYndWUHJ5UFdmbmZiODVEeG13Vmp1cHpobUo4MkhDb1VBVThoMjViclZxX3g4TmdJaG9xRW14WFk5M3ROZXfSAbMBQVVfeXFMUE52X1BRTDdUSGpFZ3JMbGNDVnlhSTZ4NHNPMWlDc2lDVGdSUV9MUy1EMmc1bmFMN3lvMGVNMVJUV3p2dWJ1UFFPb0NYT3pkTG1fYmYyazdha01IejB6M0RDMGoxbEZuQnNnZnc0ZFdDNko0QUR0VHNDV2xwMnAzQzJzblFYS2taSmlFYlV5ejBuZXd5SDVFMVVjRC13WXNIUnA4RkhuTWNJWDRkMWZCNWN2NlU</guid></item><item><title>Over 50 deaths linked to 'unknown disease' in Congo - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNYWE0MTE3eHpyOG8ybGtNYVNkb1R3ZnpDT0ZQWEdSbEhfY24tMkE4UDFnVmI3U3AwNDdLNlNTOEJqVzJ3cUtMNmFwNW8tVGNnbFRnNkgtWDVmdVJRd05IeG5HbThHbUJNeTVldWxXZWdDVGhJVXlZX2JpMk52ZFFncW5JWGV6Tkw0dnZF0gGQAUFVX3lxTE1TM2VsTm5fV2FMLUVFRmVCQ1pNQm1icU9uYVptSDZrNXVKSGRPVmNQNkRzS3drZEVBbWxrSEZLaF9GZXE5Q21CcVZRZW1FV3ZPbmNBNnA3RHJYMW1QelAxcW5xMkFJT3pvSmNJTFVRREdnVTlkTXp0S0NQek9KZUV2RnJpWVMxMGM0N0s2T3Jpag?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;The World Health Organization has reported that there is a deadly "unknown disease" spreading in one region within the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Local health officials in Congo are partnering with the World Health Organization to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;A general view of the World Health Organization (WHO) on April 28, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Harold Cunningham/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The phrase "unknown disease" primarily means that the disease has not yet been identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In previous cases, the cases are linked to a known disease, but a lack of available testing leads to lack of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, there was a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/undiagnosed-disease-congo-linked-malaria-africa-cdc/story?id=116939557" target="_blank"&gt;separate report&lt;/a&gt;

Patients have had fevers up to 104 degrees, coughing, runny nose and red, irritated eyes. After that, they develop a rash that starts near the scalp and spreads down the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms may not appear until two weeks after a person is exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s up to health officials now to do what’s called contact tracing. That means painstakingly tracking down anyone who was in those public spaces at the same time — or several hours afterward — to tell them about the exposure and give guidance on what they should do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That’s on top of the ongoing investigations in the outbreak’s epicenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“My biggest concern right now is the manpower needed to do all of the contact tracing,” said Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and health authority for the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re managing right now, but if this grows any bigger, we’re going to need some more help.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 23:06:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPc0NWOEN0QjVQQ01FVkFfQ0dIR2UxVXN1SWdEUDlmSnZDU00xRkkzNWNzb0lRWWVQTXpELXdfN251aXc5SGxoZHhFWHpDV05EYzU5S1ZkTm1ITlZWM3V2ZGMxT240alpielVYaXgxaHNMcWY5Zi05SWtxcnR3aDk5d3RLR29lVzE2X0lJVGllY1pzRnI2NlMzc2hIVDI3S2hYVUHSAVZBVV95cUxNYlFxYnpDNktob1pQbzJSV2FIZFRoenN6MnJISDR0TXNHdlRSQlFFcDlUbVY5dmJ4MkM1Q2pqXzY4aE9UaUpwd2NsY0d6N09aMlRFazQ1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Brain surgery took all my childhood memories - will i forget my fiance after second op? - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFAyRXZ6dUl4eDFraUFtMXlIRGNrMkdlTGVRRlBwenJndkxON0tDV1cwQmJncW4yUDJEYlJhZzJ6TW0yV3lVcUJwT2tucFE5ZkdfRU5na2xPLVZmUdIBX0FVX3lxTFAxVk9peWJtREQ3LWFDWWlFU0VrYXFNUF9qVTRUZmFiTUd1TlZnQzlxbU1ZOEUya2dwMGxaRmFLY1dfc0IxUmpxa1ZRYnY2RXM1YXM5UTZjbWRxalNKaHBv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 bWszMR"&gt;Brain surgery took my childhood memories - will new op make me forget my fiance?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 khDNZq"&gt;Debbie Jackson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 jtKrhe"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Scotland News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-4 cVwCpL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c02e/live/e5553150-f39f-11ef-9171-13a46257ded9.jpg.webp" alt="Weronika Somerville Weronika takes a selfie on a country lane, with a path leading off behind her and hedges on her right side, a row of trees on her left.

            Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China have discovered a new lineage of a coronavirus in bats that can enter human cells in a similar fashion as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to a recently published study. But there are no reported infections in humans, and experts say it’s not currently a threat to public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0005336mydd5hlr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like SARS-CoV-2, HKU5-CoV-2 can enter cells via the human ACE2 receptor protein on cell surfaces. The newly identified coronavirus is a part of the same family as the virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that causes deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0006336mjct6j2dz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the study, published last week in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425001448%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, scientists found the coronavirus in anal swab samples taken from a bat of the genus Pipistrellus. A lab experiment showed that the virus could infect human cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfg8p0000336m4og41alu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pointing to the fact that researchers have not detected any infections in humans, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an email to CNN that it was aware of the publication “but there is no reason to believe it currently poses a concern to public health.” The CDC added that it “will continue to monitor viral disease activity and provide important updates to the public.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0007336maew2jupu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists say the newly identified coronavirus doesn’t&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;infect cells as efficiently as the virus that causes Covid-19. But with the work originating at the Wuhan, China, lab that’s been the target of questions about where Covid-19 originated, it quickly captured attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0008336mj036donw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the new research contains some pandemic-associated trigger words, Dr. Amira Roess said there is no reason for concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0009336mcwwfis2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even the researchers themselves point out that this should not cause panic,” said Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University’s College of Public Health who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has worked with international colleagues to better understand the MERS coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000a336mmq2ium3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this study is important, Roess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000b336mho8jktqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It helps us understand what happens in the event that this does spill over and pose a risk. It’s good to get ahead of that,” she said. “The more we know about these viruses, the better.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000e336mdbjludpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In experiments, antiviral medications that worked against SARS-CoV-2 also seemed to be active against the newly named coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000c336m8uho3xg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington Medical Center, who developed tests to detect Covid-19 early in the pandemic, described nature as “the best bioterrorist” but also agreed that people shouldn’t be alarmed about the newly identified&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coronavirus – or even surprised that scientists found it in bats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000d336me4dxq8ud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are probably a lot of coronaviruses circulating in bats that can enter human cells,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000f336msldtthga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If people want to worry, Greninger said, they can worry about the other coronaviruses that are endemic and making people sick right now. The viruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032340181400222X" target="_blank"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; the common cold. They give most people only minor respiratory issues, but such infections can also develop into pneumonia or croup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000g336mo1etjujn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re here every winter, so frankly, we should be talking about those rather than HKU5,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000h336mrp6272x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phoebe Lostroh, author of “Molecular and Cellular Biology of Viruses,” said headlines about how this newly named coronavirus could cause the next pandemic are overblown and “not helpful,” particularly when there is already fear in the world about the US withdrawing from global health efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000i336mo1o5xowy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think we ought to be a lot more worried about problems like avian flu and its impact on cows and kitties and all sorts of other mammals than this new coronavirus that was isolated from a population of bats in China that reminds us of SARS-CoV-2 but is not really a breakthrough discovery,” said Lostroh, an associate professor of molecular biology at Colorado College.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000j336mui5ho26x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roess said the study highlights why scientists collaborate globally to monitor and understand viruses that have the potential to hurt human health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000k336m3jrxq9w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s sad to think about how we’re separating ourselves from the global public health world,” she said. Under President Donald Trump, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;US is withdrawing&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization and has ceased support of health programs through USAID. “This highlights to me why it’s so important to do global work and to do these global collaborations over the long haul.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There’s other things that bats carry that can be very problematic for people,” she said. “So respect these wild animals, don’t interact with them too much, because you could end up hurting them and yourself.”

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfek400la2dp9gao36r9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China have discovered a new lineage of a coronavirus in bats that can enter human cells in a similar fashion as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, according to a recently published study. But there are no reported infections in humans, and experts say it’s not currently a threat to public health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0005336mydd5hlr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like SARS-CoV-2, HKU5-CoV-2 can enter cells via the human ACE2 receptor protein on cell surfaces. The newly identified coronavirus is a part of the same family as the virus&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that causes deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0006336mjct6j2dz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the study, published last week in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425001448%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;journal Cell&lt;/a&gt;, scientists found the coronavirus in anal swab samples taken from a bat of the genus Pipistrellus. A lab experiment showed that the virus could infect human cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktfg8p0000336m4og41alu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pointing to the fact that researchers have not detected any infections in humans, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an email to CNN that it was aware of the publication “but there is no reason to believe it currently poses a concern to public health.” The CDC added that it “will continue to monitor viral disease activity and provide important updates to the public.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0007336maew2jupu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists say the newly identified coronavirus doesn’t&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;infect cells as efficiently as the virus that causes Covid-19. But with the work originating at the Wuhan, China, lab that’s been the target of questions about where Covid-19 originated, it quickly captured attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0008336mj036donw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the new research contains some pandemic-associated trigger words, Dr. Amira Roess said there is no reason for concern.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd0009336mcwwfis2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even the researchers themselves point out that this should not cause panic,” said Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University’s College of Public Health who&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has worked with international colleagues to better understand the MERS coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000a336mmq2ium3v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research like this study is important, Roess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000b336mho8jktqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It helps us understand what happens in the event that this does spill over and pose a risk. It’s good to get ahead of that,” she said. “The more we know about these viruses, the better.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000e336mdbjludpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In experiments, antiviral medications that worked against SARS-CoV-2 also seemed to be active against the newly named coronavirus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000c336m8uho3xg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Alex Greninger, a professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the University of Washington Medical Center, who developed tests to detect Covid-19 early in the pandemic, described nature as “the best bioterrorist” but also agreed that people shouldn’t be alarmed about the newly identified&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;coronavirus – or even surprised that scientists found it in bats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000d336me4dxq8ud@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are probably a lot of coronaviruses circulating in bats that can enter human cells,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000f336msldtthga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If people want to worry, Greninger said, they can worry about the other coronaviruses that are endemic and making people sick right now. The viruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978032340181400222X" target="_blank"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; the common cold. They give most people only minor respiratory issues, but such infections can also develop into pneumonia or croup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000g336mo1etjujn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re here every winter, so frankly, we should be talking about those rather than HKU5,” Greninger said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000h336mrp6272x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phoebe Lostroh, author of “Molecular and Cellular Biology of Viruses,” said headlines about how this newly named coronavirus could cause the next pandemic are overblown and “not helpful,” particularly when there is already fear in the world about the US withdrawing from global health efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000i336mo1o5xowy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think we ought to be a lot more worried about problems like avian flu and its impact on cows and kitties and all sorts of other mammals than this new coronavirus that was isolated from a population of bats in China that reminds us of SARS-CoV-2 but is not really a breakthrough discovery,” said Lostroh, an associate professor of molecular biology at Colorado College.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000j336mui5ho26x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roess said the study highlights why scientists collaborate globally to monitor and understand viruses that have the potential to hurt human health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ktgavd000k336m3jrxq9w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s sad to think about how we’re separating ourselves from the global public health world,” she said. Under President Donald Trump, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;US is withdrawing&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organization and has ceased support of health programs through USAID. “This highlights to me why it’s so important to do global work and to do these global collaborations over the long haul.”

But she also suggests focusing on an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="80/20 style of eating" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;80/20 style of eating&lt;/a&gt;, where you try to eat healthy 80 percent of the time and are more lenient with what you eat for the other 20 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Keatley also suggests consuming fermented foods like yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kimchi" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, and kefir, which have probiotics that can help regulate neurotransmitter levels in the brain, along with nut and seeds, which provide omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation and enhance gut-brain communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Legumes, fatty fish, and leafy green vegetables may also help, per Keatley. “Together, these foods create a diet that supports gut health, reduces systemic inflammation, and enhances neurotransmitter balance, all of which contribute to lowering the risk of depression,” he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-17" data-node-id="32" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-eoj2tz e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;More From WH On Your Gut And Microbiomes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-this-effect-compare-to-antidepressant-medications" data-node-id="33" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this effect compare to antidepressant medications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Well, this study specifically looked at preventing depression. Antidepressants are usually used to &lt;em&gt;treat&lt;/em&gt; depression, Gallagher points out. So, it’s not clear, based on these findings, how eating oranges when you already have depression may impact your symptoms or treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But this is important: “Don’t go off your medications and start eating oranges,” Gallagher says. Saltz agrees. "I would not advise anyone based on this study to in any way consider oranges a treatment for clinical major depression," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Still, Gallagher calls the findings “exciting” for mental health. “This is something that you could easily implement in your diet and probably should regardless,” she says. “It’s accessible, and that’s always a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

So, if you’re a grapefruit fan, you can feel good knowing that you’re also doing your mental health a solid by having a daily serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is citrus so special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things about citrus that seem to give it extra oomph when it comes to improving mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The real game-changer in citrus is its high concentration of flavonoids, such as naringenin and formononetin,” Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These flavonoids help support the growth of the essential bacteria &lt;em&gt;F. prausnitzii, &lt;/em&gt;and also may regulate processes in the gut that help increase the availability of our "feel-good" neurotransmitters, serotonin and dopamine, in the body, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But keep in mind that the study's findings don't actually &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that consuming citrus influences your mental health—they just establish a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also only looks at one aspect of citrus' impact on the gut, and specifically, the bacterial link, points out &lt;a href="https://doctors.nyp.org/gail-m-saltz-md/1095-park-avenue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gail Saltz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Gail Saltz&lt;/a&gt;, MD, associate professor of psychiatry at the NY Presbyterian Hospital Weill-Cornell School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Citrus may impact the gut biome, but it also has other features, such as high vitamin C, which could figure into this story," she says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there other foods that can lower depression risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2809727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has found a link between eating a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63592662/ultraprocessed-foods-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and a higher risk of depression, which suggests that eating whole, unprocessed foods may be better for your mental and physical health, Gallagher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallagher adds that focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and foods that don’t have a lot of ingredients is the “safe route” when it comes to eating for mental health. But she also suggests focusing on an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a30813088/80-20-diet-weight-lifting-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80/20 style of eating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80/20 style of eating&lt;/a&gt;, where you try to eat healthy 80 percent of the time and are more lenient with what you eat for the other 20 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keatley also suggests consuming fermented foods like yogurt, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29892608/health-benefits-of-kimchi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kimchi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kimchi&lt;/a&gt;, and kefir, which have probiotics that can help regulate neurotransmitter levels in the brain, along with nut and seeds, which provide omega-3 fatty acids that reduce inflammation and enhance gut-brain communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legumes, fatty fish, and leafy green vegetables may also help, per Keatley. “Together, these foods create a diet that supports gut health, reduces systemic inflammation, and enhances neurotransmitter balance, all of which contribute to lowering the risk of depression,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this effect compare to antidepressant medications?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, this study specifically looked at preventing depression. Antidepressants are usually used to &lt;em&gt;treat&lt;/em&gt; depression, Gallagher points out. So, it’s not clear, based on these findings, how eating oranges when you already have depression may impact your symptoms or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is important: “Don’t go off your medications and start eating oranges,” Gallagher says. Saltz agrees. "I would not advise anyone based on this study to in any way consider oranges a treatment for clinical major depression," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Gallagher calls the findings “exciting” for mental health. “This is something that you could easily implement in your diet and probably should regardless,” she says. “It’s accessible, and that’s always a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 22:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5EejhvWnFyRHR0YkxDZE1DTHZzaHp5YmI5ZVllLXZMNnFsWEZkdjNobm4tbnhxQm1lLUVHV0E4Zm9KZUZLTS1Ib0hQVkktUWZUTjZnNUs5ZzdjanBmWUFTOE55Wm5vT240WmlYOWhWYkMzdw</guid></item><item><title>Plant Chemicals May Counteract Harmful Microplastics - Newsmax</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNUGtrTEtfX1gwNnkwWklreFpRN3l3cFZJMmhxOVNjX3VubnEzVlg5aEJ0U1ZqRmdWNTU5UFVRVzVqYThDQ2pCWWpKVURVNktqS1JnZi16TmdlN0pMMHF0QjhOUTIyY3NUc1VKbGxLV0twWXRvbjdnXzBZS0Z2eTJsbi1fNmlhNjJ3UFAwOXhDSkdSUTJocTdoZFZlcWtOZlJoZ2h0Y0k5QXnSAa4BQVVfeXFMT3RqaWtXVnFqT3l6WVdldkZQendJMGRCLXZnZ2s1dUJjaGw5eldpWlRjVVRQemdQMk85UDVHLTIyT0hJTFlqWmxnYmdaVW9fVW9pMm1aRlI2eWZtRXB1TE1ob0lYUllIYmxCRExSdTBmeHRWWkZtM3JyclZka3JNSE53RDF6WnNMekhWaEtzMEJqYklLQmQ0OEp1SzJzbEhUakUzbE1GNGh5MTl3T2Z3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mainArticleDiv" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;A promising new study found that eating lots of fruit and vegetables that are naturally high in antioxidants may lessen the harmful effects of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers with the Finland-China Food and Health Network published their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11803829/"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; on how anthocyanins, a type of antioxidant flavonoid, can counteract the oxidative stress caused by these tiny plastic particles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthocyanins are pigments that give red, purple, and blue fruits and vegetables their vibrant colors. They are found in foods such as blueberries, raspberries, and eggplants. These compounds have been shown to possess strong antioxidant properties that help safeguard our cells from damage and support overall health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/antioxidants-fruits-flowers-microplastics"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, the anthocyanins protect against a wide range of plastic-induced negative effects including reduction in testosterone and estrogen, decreased sperm counts and poorer quality sperm, erectile dysfunction and ovarian damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are &lt;a href="https://www.newsmax.com/health/health-news/microplastics-nanoplastics-tissues/2024/12/30/id/1193369/"&gt;everywhere&lt;/a&gt;. They are tiny plastic particles, less than 5 millimeters in diameter, that originate from a variety of sources including larger plastic debris that degrades into smaller and smaller pieces, and from microbeads found in beauty products, cleaning products, and industrial processes. These particles are so small that they can pass through water filtration systems and end up in oceans and other bodies of water, where they become a pervasive environmental pollutant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many as 16,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic, such as BPA, phthalates, and PFAS, known as “forever chemicals” because they last a long time, are found in microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microplastics can absorb harmful chemicals from their surroundings, which can then enter the human body when the microplastics are ingested, leading to various health issues. Some studies suggest that microplastics can disrupt hormone function in humans, leading to reproductive health issues, including decreased fertility, reduced sperm quality, and hormonal imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the reproductive system, microplastics have been found in the testicles and semen in men. In women, they’ve been discovered in ovarian tissue, placentas, breast milk and fetuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers found that male rats that were exposed to microplastics and then treated with anthocyanins had increased sperm counts and motility. Treating female rats with anthocyanins seemed to protect hormone receptors from the plastic chemicals and normalized levels of estrogen and other hormones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While human studies are needed, researchers say their findings are promising in the search for ways to combat the onslaught of microplastics. Eating plenty of fruits, nuts, and vegetables, are a good way to help protect against the damage in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The skulls of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/famous-viking-runestone-linked-to-fears-of-climate-change-says-study"&gt;Viking-age Swedes&lt;/a&gt;, dated between the 10th and 12th centuries, suggest the population of the time was suffering from a wide variety of ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Gothenburg and Västergötlands Museum in Sweden analyzed the human remains using modern computed tomography (CT) scans and found evidence of mouth diseases, jaw joint damage, sinus and ear infections, tooth decay, osteoarthritis, and other problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was much to look at," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; odontologist Carolina Bertilsson, from the University of Gothenburg. "We found many signs of disease in these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exactly why we don't know. While we can't study the damage in the soft tissue because it's no longer there, we can see the traces left in the skeletal structures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153142" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153142" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan.jpg" alt="Skull scan" class="wp-image-153142 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullScan-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153142" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The skulls were put through a CT scanner. (Bertilsson et al., &lt;em&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team took a close look at 15 skulls collected from the well-known &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varnhem_Abbey"&gt;Varnhem Abbey&lt;/a&gt; archaeological site in the province of Västergötland. The skulls were taken from adults who died between the ages of 24 and 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan"&gt;CT scans&lt;/a&gt; – which are precise types of X-ray scans, taken in three dimensions – the researchers saw damage to both the surface and the interior of the skulls, and they mapped that damage to probable causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153144" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage.jpg" alt="Skull damage" class="wp-image-153144 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage-396x415.jpg 396w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/SkullDamage-600x629.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153144" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A variety of types of skull damage were discovered. (Bertilsson et al., &lt;em&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a demonstration of just how much valuable information can be revealed by these types of scans on these kinds of remains, giving us a better idea of how these people lived, back when there were far fewer treatments for pain and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone knows what it's like to have pain somewhere, you can get quite desperate for help," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bertilsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But back then, they didn't have the medical and dental care we do, or the kind of pain relief – and antibiotics – we now have. If you developed an infection, it could stick around for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the research team behind this study had &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-studied-3000-viking-teeth-and-discovered-surprisingly-advanced-dentistry"&gt;previously looked&lt;/a&gt; at teeth recovered from the same site, finding extensive evidence of tooth decay and even some rudimentary attempts at dentistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been ongoing at the Varnhem site &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/new-excavations-in-varnhem"&gt;for decades now&lt;/a&gt;. It's a significant religious landmark, once the largest church in Sweden, and is the resting place for three Swedish kings from the Middle Ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that applying their CT scan approach to other ancient remains could reveal all kinds of new discoveries that wouldn't be spotted with a normal visual inspection – and without causing unnecessary damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Very many of today's archaeological methods are invasive, with the need to remove bone or other tissue for analysis," &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/news/viking-skulls-reveal-severe-morbidity"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bertilsson. "This way, we can keep the remains completely intact yet still extract a great deal of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-025-00309-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Dental Journal Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(25)00039-2/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;systematic review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of five studies concludes that, even after successful tuberculosis (TB) treatment, children and teens experience substantial respiratory impairment, with 40% to 65% having abnormal lung function and those younger than 10 years showing reduced height and weight and lower quality of life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McGill University researchers in Canada led the review, published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;eClinical Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The team reviewed studies published from January 2004 to December 2024 involving children aged 0 to 19 years who completed TB treatment and had at least one related impairment or disability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After identifying 117 potential studies, only 5—all published in 2023 and 2024 in South Africa or The Gambia—met the inclusion criteria, because over 80% excluded children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Tuberculosis remains a significant global health challenge, affecting over 10 million people annually, including more than 1 million children under 15 years of age," the researchers wrote. "Tuberculosis-associated respiratory impairment and disability, also known as post-tuberculosis lung disease, results from the complex interplay of bacterial, host, and environmental factors." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TB effects differ in adults, children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After TB treatment, children younger than 5 years had diminished respiratory capacity. Of those aged 5 to 10 years, about 40% had abnormal lung function post-treatment, rising to 65% in those older than 10. Disability was common, with 35% to 50% of all children experiencing respiratory symptoms (eg, wheezing, cough) and children younger than 10 years displaying reduced physical growth and lower quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after successful tuberculosis treatment, children and adolescents can experience respiratory impairments and disability that may reduce their quality of life, ability to participate in activities, and growth potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even after successful tuberculosis treatment, children and adolescents can experience respiratory impairments and disability that may reduce their quality of life, ability to participate in activities, and growth potential," they wrote. "The epidemiology and clinical manifestations of these impairments vary by age, reflecting distinct biological and behavioural differences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers call for future TB research involving children. &lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;Given the differences in the spectrum of tuberculosis disease, lung development, and underlying comorbidity differences between children, adolescents, and adults, age-disaggregated data are essential to fully understand the long-term impact of tuberculosis on respiratory health throughout the life course," they concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But carbs can actually help you achieve your weight loss goals—and oats are the No. 1 whole grain for weight loss, according to nutrition experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No disrespect to the die-hard &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8067257/keto-2-0/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:keto fans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;keto fans&lt;/a&gt; out there, but our bodies need carbs for energy—and there’s no argument about that. So before you pass up the air-popped popcorn, know that not all carbs are created equal. “Yes, whole grains contain carbs, but they’re jam-packed with nutrients such as B vitamins, folate, iron, zinc and magnesium. They’re an excellent source of fiber and antioxidants,” says Kulp. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8022085/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-avoid-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Happens to Your Body When You Avoid Carbs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Happens to Your Body When You Avoid Carbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown rice, oats, barley and spelt are a few whole grains with nutrient profiles that differ from their &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:refined-grain counterparts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;refined-grain counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s most important to understand for grain to be whole, it must contain all parts of the grain—the germ, bran and endosperm. That is where the magic happens in terms of health benefits,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/kara-burnstine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kara Burnstine, M.S., RD, LDN, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kara Burnstine, M.S., RD, LDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, at Pritikin Longevity Center. Refined grains, on the other hand, are processed to remove at least one of these critical parts of the grain kernel, reducing its nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avena sativa&lt;/em&gt;, aka oats, comes from a plant in the &lt;em&gt;Poaceae&lt;/em&gt; family and ranks in the top three most important grains in the U.S., right after wheat and corn, per a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9930024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Current Nutrition Reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Nutrition Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Short- and long-term oats consumption lowers cholesterol levels, regulates blood sugars and improves liver functions.

That’s 24% to 32% of the Daily Value for fiber!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oats can help with weight loss by affecting appetite hormones and feeding your gut microbes. They have a unique antioxidant called beta-glucan, which works as a prebiotic, fueling the good gut microbes that can impact appetite hormones, GLP-1 and PYY. These hormones slow down stomach emptying to keep you feeling full longer, and the hormone leptin tells your body it’s had enough and it’s time to stop eating. This combination can lead to eating less at a meal and not feeling hungry for longer,” explains Kulp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Provide Plant-Based Protein&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to other types of whole grains, like wheat, rice and millet, oats outshine the competition when it comes to protein. Oat protein is plentiful in essential amino acids, including valine, lysine and isoleucine, per a 2022 review published in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9294724/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frontiers in Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not a complete protein, a half-cup of steel-cut oats provides 10 grams of protein. That's more than twice the amount of protein in half a cup of cow’s milk, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/746782/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. Like fiber, the protein in oats may help satisfy your appetite, curbing your calorie intake. Further, a growing body of research has shown that high protein intake may help lower body weight and decrease fat mass while preserving lean muscle, per a 2024 study in &lt;a href="https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.16013" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Might Help Balance Your Blood Sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research also suggests that whole grains have a lower glycemic index, a scale that rates foods based on how quickly they spike your blood sugar levels,” says Mitri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The soluble fiber in oats [helps] slow down the absorption of carbohydrates and helps regulate blood sugar levels by preventing blood sugar spikes and subsequent cravings for sugary foods,” adds Burnstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, beta-glucan, a type of fiber abundantly found in oats, may help maintain normal levels of insulin—the hormone responsible for managing blood sugar levels, per a 2022 review published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214799322001096" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Current Opinion in Food Science;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Opinion in Food Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Many Ways to Add to Your Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats are heaping with nutrients, especially minerals like magnesium, manganese, iron, chromium and zinc. What’s more, they’re budget-friendly, convenient and easily incorporated into meals and snacks you can enjoy anytime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for other ways to enjoy oats beyond a typical oatmeal, there are many ways to get creative in the kitchen with oats. In the evenings, you could mix oats, milk, apples and cinnamon to enjoy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/268076/apple-cinnamon-overnight-oats/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Apple-Cinnamon Overnight Oats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Apple-Cinnamon Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt; for a quick grab-and-go breakfast the next morning.

People usually experience their first taste of oats as instant oats, and they may love the taste and ease of instant,” says &lt;a href="https://mynutritioninsights.com/index.php/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amy Beney, M.S., RD, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amy Beney, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavored instant oats tend to have a lot of added sugar but if you choose unflavored instant oats, their nutritional profile is pretty similar to steel-cut and rolled oats. And Beney notes that steel-cut oats are the least processed type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Whole Grains and Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often celebrate whole grains for their heart-healthy benefits, from lowering cholesterol to improving blood pressure. Their fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins and minerals profile may also benefit weight loss. However, some falsely believe that eating high-fiber foods causes weight gain when, in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8070018/fiber-and-weight-gain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:it may do the opposite;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;it may do the opposite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies do suggest whole grains can assist with weight loss. The fiber in whole grains is like a speed bump in a road and slows digestion, which in turn aids in the fullness factor,” says Burnstine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example is a 2024 study published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11280444/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that including whole grains in your eating routine may aid in weight management by helping you lose weight and preventing weight gain. This study also suggests that higher whole grain intake is associated with lower odds of obesity, including in general and abdominal obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you eat whole grains at all, you may notice they’re chewier in texture than refined grains and tend to take longer to cook and more bites to eat. This may lead to more satiety. “This high fiber content can help you to feel full and satisfied, naturally leading to fewer calories consumed,” says Kulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to satiety, whole grains can help with blood sugar. “Whole grains provide a steady source of energy due to their &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complex carbohydrates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;complex carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;. This can help stabilize blood sugar levels and prevent energy crashes that might lead to unhealthy snacking,” says &lt;a href="https://carolinefarrell.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Caroline Farrell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Caroline Farrell&lt;/a&gt;, a registered nutritionist in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Along with their fiber, whole grains also contain polyphenols, a plant nutrient that can feed good gut microbes,” adds Kulp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods that feed gut-friendly bacteria are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052689/best-prebiotic-foods-for-better-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:known as prebiotics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;known as prebiotics&lt;/a&gt;. "[Prebiotics] enhance the diversity and function of gut microbiota, which can influence energy balance (how your body uses and stores energy) and fat storage,” says Magil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oats are a nutritious whole grain that can help you achieve your weight loss goals. “Many people think they have to eat a low-carb diet to lose weight or are unsure which carbs are best to eat. I would recommend they focus on what to add to their diet versus what to restrict for weight loss,” says Mitri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, consider which nutrients are you low in—like fiber—and what foods are rich in those nutrients—like oats. You can add oats—or other fiber-rich grains—at any time of day, whether it’s for dinner or an energizing snack. Their potent nutrition from fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants may make them worthy of complementing your weight-loss efforts and health overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866255/foods-you-should-eat-every-week-to-lose-weight/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:11 Foods to Eat to Help You Lose Weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;11 Foods to Eat to Help You Lose Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-whole-grain-for-weight-loss-11686388" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 20:52:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFA4RTNnTXM5TDJMb3NPYzZodEV1SV82NWxVZlVEWDJQUVR4V2pHVmRoQlUyWXB3cjMzS2VuR2pEMW1lTzJfNF9tcmJQNmlja0dvNDRPZzk1M3NLRUYzWEgzNV9MVUoxcGh6VzBJZQ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover New Coronavirus With Potential to Infect Humans: What to Know - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxNMVo5bzRJWDEyUXNpMWpIR3dPa3p0V0hiVXVFaV9tRkxIbWMxaGxOd3A4RVZ1ZjRNUy1JUXhJc0l5dGFna0JpWGwxTGd2REkyWHQwdTEyeURBNmo0ZmRaWnpiYTkzNnRvd1pqUm9vNHRyVHdwRXlSU0FaY1BiTXk0N1VBQ0FSX1NNcU1aMU1pRkMzZmR2RE50ZkVfOTRpd0JrbHdLSXcwM3VWMU9aUjZRZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;New research out this month showcases the ever-present danger posed by coronaviruses, the family of viruses that gave rise to the covid-19 pandemic. Scientists in China have reportedly found a new coronavirus in bats that may be capable of spilling over and infecting humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. In lab experiments, the virus appeared to possess a key adaptation that allows it to infect a broad range of mammals, humans included. Other factors are present that make the virus less suited to humans for now, but the scientists say their discovery highlights the importance of studying these sorts of potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coronaviruses are a broad group of viruses that infect mammals and birds, seven of which are known to infect humans. Four of these viruses usually cause a mild cold; one caused a major but short-lived epidemic in the early 2000s (the original SARS virus); another causes MERS, a dangerous but limited zoonotic disease that typically spreads from camels to humans; and SARS-CoV-2—the recently discovered coronavirus that caused the worst pandemic seen in a century, &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#:~:text=The%20Economist%20built,COVID%2D19.19"&gt;killing upwards of 20 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide since appearing in late 2019. Though covid-19 is substantially less deadly now, thanks in large part to vaccines, it still &lt;a href="https://x.com/BNOFeed/status/1893852906765295894"&gt;routinely kills&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of Americans weekly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even before the arrival of covid-19, scientists have long worried about the risk of coronaviruses sparking the next big outbreak, given how widespread they are across the animal kingdom. In 2006, researchers in Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7111821/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a coronavirus in pipistrelle bats that became known as HKU5-CoV. The discovery was valuable, even if the virus itself didn’t seem to possess the machinery needed to infect humans easily. But the Wuhan scientists say they have now discovered a distinct lineage of HKU5-CoV more capable of jumping over to humans, which they’ve dubbed HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the lab, the researchers found evidence that HKU5-CoV-2 could potentially infect a wide range of mammals. It does so by interacting with a protein receptor found in many types of cells, called ACE2. For those who kept up with pandemic-era science, ACE2 is the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 hacks to infect our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mammals have slightly different versions of ACE2 from one another, and it’s no guarantee that a bat-infecting coronavirus can bind to the human version of ACE2. But the team’s work found that strains of HKU5-CoV-2 could “efficiently” use human ACE2 (and other mammalian versions of ACE2) to enter cells. HKU5-CoV-2 is more closely related to the MERS virus than SARS-CoV-2 and the researchers also found evidence that antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 may offer little protection against HKU5-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These findings, however, do not mean that HKU5-CoV-2 is destined to become the next covid. Importantly, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported to date. And even if a virus can theoretically spread from one kind of animal to humans, that doesn’t ensure it will be able to spread between people (the vast majority of the time, it doesn’t). Perhaps significantly, the researchers identified other aspects of the newly found virus that likely hinders it from infecting people easily—a key point they highlighted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Due to these suboptimal factors for human adaptation, the risk of BtHKU5-CoV-2 emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;What this research does show, however, is that our fight against emerging infectious diseases exists in perpetuity. HKU5-CoV-2 might never jump over into humans, but others like it eventually could. Whether it’s a coronavirus, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/bird-flu"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, or some other unknown germ, the stage for the next pandemic will be set. So tracking and learning more about these threats as early as possible will be essential to stopping or at least blunting the harm they can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A highly publicized new paper that reported high levels of microplastics in human brain tissue contains duplicated images, according to the study’s principal investigator. The duplicates likely do not affect the main findings of the work, two microplastics researchers who were not involved in the study told &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter&lt;/em&gt;, but the amount of microplastics may have been overestimated because of other methodological issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images depict particles isolated from postmortem human brain tissue and later analyzed to determine their chemical identity. The duplications were first identified by an anonymous &lt;a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/C9D7A272C52C280753B7B381BC858F" target="_blank"&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; posted on PubPeer, a post-publication peer-review site, earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal investigator &lt;a href="https://hsc.unm.edu/directory/campen-matthew-j.html" target="_blank"&gt;Matthew Campen&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that the three sets of images in question had been duplicated, first in a statement he sent to &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter &lt;/em&gt;and later in a reply to the comment on PubPeer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These images from ATR-FTIR [an analytical chemistry method] in the supplement were assembled without enough attention to detail,” Campen, professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of New Mexico, told &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “We have the correct images and will submit shortly. The mistake is purely clerical and in no way alters the conclusions of our manuscript.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 400 news outlets and other websites have covered the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03453-1" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; since it was published on 3 February in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, according to Altmetric, a data science company that tracks online mentions of research articles. “We are aware of the concerns flagged on PubPeer and are looking into the matter. We are committed to addressing any issues whether they are raised during the submission process for a paper or post-publication, and take our responsibility to maintain the accuracy of the scientific record very seriously,” a spokesperson for &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine &lt;/em&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter &lt;/em&gt;in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

            I think we should be more cautious about the limitations of our work before we tell people, ‘You have a spoonful of plastics in your brain.’        &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class="mt-px lg:my-4 lg:hidden"&gt; — &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;span class="block font-sans font-bold leading-4.2 text-2xs uppercase mt-2 mb-1 lg:mt-6 lg:text-sm"&gt;
                &lt;span class="hidden lg:inline"&gt; — &lt;/span&gt;
                Martin Wagner 
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brain tissue samples collected in 2024 from 24 people contain a median of 4.9 milligrams of micro- and nanoplastics per gram of tissue, Campen and his team reported. Scaled up, that would mean an average brain contains a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;plastic spoon’s worth&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/03/microplastics-human-brain-increase/" target="_blank"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, Campen &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/katherinehignett/2025/02/04/your-brain-could-be-holding-a-spoons-worth-of-microplastics/" target="_blank"&gt;told several&lt;/a&gt; major &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/02/03/microplastics-brain-body-accumulation-study/78005554007/" target="_blank"&gt;news outlets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duplications likely do not alter the conclusions of the paper, say microplastics researchers &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.rutgers.edu/directory/stapleton-phoebe/" target="_blank"&gt;Phoebe Stapleton&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Rutgers University, and &lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/martin.wagner" target="_blank"&gt;Martin Wagner,&lt;/a&gt; professor of biology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images are “really just examples of the particles that they analyzed,” Wagner says. But the investigators may have “massively overestimated the mass of microplastics in their samples,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study reports microplastics levels in the brain that are “higher than those reported in sewage sludge, which seems unlikely,” says &lt;a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/profiles/j/oliver-jones" target="_blank"&gt;Oliver Jones&lt;/a&gt;, professor of chemistry at The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, a group in the Netherlands reported that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143319" target="_blank"&gt;black plastic kitchen utensils&lt;/a&gt; release flame retardants at levels nearing the safe exposure limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The researchers later &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143903" target="_blank"&gt;corrected the study&lt;/a&gt; because the safe exposure level they calculated was only one-tenth of the actual limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="first-letter:text-2xl first-letter:float-left first-letter:text-red first-letter:pr-2 pb-0"&gt;
    T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
o quantify the amount of microplastics in biological tissue, researchers must isolate potential plastic particles from other organic material in the sample through chemical digestion, density separation or other methods, Wagner says, and then analyze the particles’ “chemical fingerprint.” This is often done with spectroscopy, which measures the wavelengths of light a material absorbs. Campen and his team used a method called pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, which measures the mass of small molecules as they are combusted from a sample. The method is lauded for its ability to detect smaller micro- and nanoplastics than other methods can, Wagner says, but it will “give you a lot of false positives” if you do not adequately remove biological material from the sample.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“False positives of microplastics are common to almost all methods of detecting them,” Jones says. “This is quite a serious issue in microplastics work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain tissue contains a large amount of lipids, some of which have similar mass spectra as the plastic polyethylene, Wagner says. “Most of the presumed plastic they found is polyethylene, which to me really indicates that they didn’t really clean up their samples properly.” Jones says he shares these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to polyethylene, the investigators reported higher concentrations of polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride in the tissue collected in 2024 compared with 28 tissue samples collected in 2016. “Notably, all show the same trends of increasing over time,” Campen told &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter &lt;/em&gt;via email, which indicates to him that the results are not an artifact. “It is difficult to argue that brain chemistry has evolved over this short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the investigators also did not provide adequate data about potential plastic contamination during the experiment, Wagner and Jones say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was extensive description of our procedure in the supplemental information,” Campen told &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter &lt;/em&gt;in an email. “It is very difficult to make everyone happy and guess what details are needed to appease every scientist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the methodological limitations, it is clear that micro- and nanoplastics are indeed present in human brains, which is concerning and warrants further study, Wagner says. But, he adds, “I think we should be more cautious about the limitations of our work before we tell people, ‘You have a spoonful of plastics in your brain.’”&lt;/p&gt;

A study published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024155508" target="_blank"&gt;November&lt;/a&gt; also found that tea leaves removed heavy metals from water. Saddam Husain Dhobi, the lead author of that study, said this research highlights the value of tea and “its potential as a safe and effective method for mitigating harmful substances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HAZSUMFJO5ANBIS3DRGIPL5TJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the new study, researchers experimented with a variety of teas, brewing methods and steeping times, and they examined the difference between loose-leaf and bagged tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="INIRUJHXB5E2DGIFZKUC33VSJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the recipe for the purest cup of tea depends on one major factor: time. The longer the steep time, the more metal that’s removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZLSQKV4EFDNJNG7IBDIHBNRMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For example, researchers found that when steeping an average cup of tea for five minutes, there was a 15 percent reduction in lead concentrations — and that trend was consistent across cups, whether the concentrations of lead were higher or lower. Brewing tea overnight, a common method for brewing iced tea, provides better water purification than steeping for a few minutes. But even a few minutes can result in a moderate removal of metals, Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TIFZESZYLVE6FLKELUWZBE5G3A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers also examined different varieties of tea to determine whether they provided any extra benefits. Black and green bagged tea were tested, as were whole tea leaves, including green, oolong, white and black teas. Herbal teas were also tested for their ability to get metals to stick to the surface of the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UFPZZVJSQBC2VFMNMN7ZZWUSVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most teas, including herbal teas, performed similarly — apart from chamomile flowers, which adsorbed metals poorly. The study found that ground tea leaves perform best, compared with whole leaves, because grinding the leaves creates additional surface area for attracting the contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5OKNKSFYZJAVTAP2IS3YB6SMGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The type of tea bag mattered too. Cellulose tea bags, a biodegradable and organic material derived from trees, were highly effective at sponging metals from water. Nylon tea bags, which can release &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/09/27/these-tea-bags-release-billions-plastic-particles-into-your-brew-study-shows/" target="_blank"&gt;billions of microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, did not perform well in the study, and cotton tea bags showed trivial adsorption capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L6FL7KQL2FBDNFAHHGZJJID6OY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Even so, the relative benefits of different tea bags and tea types were “marginal compared to the benefit of having more time,” Shindel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JD2FVULCKJD43ENLQKKLMTYZAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While Shindel, who now works with the Energy Department’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, can’t definitively say what the human health outcome would be for drinking tea, he suggested that it could lead to declines in illnesses closely correlated to heavy metal exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AE2MSL6RJNCOJIL7PUKIJVJPXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“People should be aware of the potential that preparing tea has to adsorb a fraction of the metals and potentially other contaminants from drinking water,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 19:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPYUg1eGhfQ3R3aHJHV3JON3VudEpRWjZudUJWVlJqY2lZRFlDNk5uSFdPSmk0OE9VbkVJOVVaRmV4UXQ5cWgwdGh4aUs4bFctWTJEYVg3Z1Rab19zTm12LUtuTUFFSnlIRGpSdkwyLXdmSVcwOGhuZjdrNmdLMkxsUlMteWxEUjllVGctWTFyM3BVcmhISnJlR1FR</guid></item><item><title>A mystery illness in Congo has killed more than 50 people hours after they felt sick - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9VUFhTWEhoTzFIb09SV2tQVlV2WE9xWGRTb2QzT01KSkhzVjBQUHNNZ0Q1eG4ycU5Xdm5LMzlXU2gweW1ZWFZmcnZpNU1zcEpkY0N3X0R4WGFEbGRqZTFrNXNlVnpVd2VBbXRpVlFMQjVUZFZXc1NLVE130gFwQVVfeXFMTWFXOFQyZXhkWWdnQnVKeWVuQUp2dkJqNDl5OFRDLUVoMHoyNDdzWmtObFlEWDlTVTJ1bUFBVDBzNE8tYXRYN185QUEtV1hDYTUyV1hnWUtUSjRra0pYV0h0TE9lb283Vmx0MXM1T19QVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            An unknown illness first discovered in three children who ate a bat has rapidly killed more than 50 people in northwestern Congo over the past five weeks, health experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu000x3b6mwdt2a4ty@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The interval between the onset of symptoms – which include fever, vomiting and internal bleeding – and death has been 48 hours in most cases and “that’s what’s really worrying,” said Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu000y3b6mdc5au2cw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These “hemorrhagic fever” symptoms are commonly linked to known deadly viruses, such as Ebola, dengue, Marburg and yellow fever, but researchers have ruled these out based on tests of more than a dozen samples collected so far.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu000z3b6me75w4htm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, with 419 cases recorded and 53 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu00103b6mbwfdeb6u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There have long been concerns about &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-united-nations-animals-world-organization-7d104d2f4a87dd29ddb5d263986f731c" target="_blank"&gt;diseases jumping from animals to humans&lt;/a&gt; in places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ku7cpu00123b6mal3agpbf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the second outbreak of the mystery disease began in the village of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases were sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples were negative for common hemorrhagic fever diseases, although some tested positive for malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Yet, more and more, the science is pointing to the health risks of drinking alcohol. In January, the U.S. Surgeon General issued an urgent health advisory, ranking alcohol as the third leading cause of cancer, right after tobacco and obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This news mirrors what happened back in 1994 when the U.S. Surgeon General at that time sparked a pivotal change in how we perceive health and social norms when he boldly stated that tobacco is linked to cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For decades, cigarette smoking was socially acceptable, with little awareness of the damage it was doing,” says&lt;a href="https://drchristinemaren.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Christine Maren, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified physician specializing in functional medicine. Fast-forward to today, and we are facing a similar wake-up call—this time with alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The new health advisory challenges the way we’ve long viewed alcohol consumption—as a harmless enjoyment, particularly in moderation. But with new data shedding light on the risks, it begs the question: Is it time to take a closer look at our relationship with alcohol? With insights from a range of health experts, we dive into this very question and offer practical tips for those looking to dial back their drinks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For much of history, alcohol has walked a thin line between remedy and risk—once celebrated as medicine, now known to carry hidden dangers. “The first alcoholic beverages emerged in China around 7000-5600 B.C., but it wasn't until the 16th century that alcohol became deeply embedded in daily life,” says &lt;a href="https://amandaewhite.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amanda E. White, LPC, LMHC&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed therapist, who herself recovered from alcohol misuse and now helps others do the same.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ancient Egyptians were toasting with beer, Greeks sipped wine at philosophical debates, medieval monks brewed beer as a spiritual practice, and alcohol was once used as a safe alternative to questionable water sources,” says &lt;a href="https://theoncologydietitian.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nichole Andrews, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an oncology registered dietitian nutritionist.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Jump ahead a few hundred years, and we’ve seen it all—from the hush-hush speakeasies of Prohibition to the glittering cocktail culture immortalized by Hollywood, Andrews shares.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For decades, alcohol was sold as a social aid, a stress reliever and even a heart-health enhancer, often praised in the Mediterranean diet for its supposed benefits when enjoyed as a daily glass of wine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But lately, science has shaken up this narrative. “Today, the conversation is shifting, thanks to mounting evidence showing alcohol’s direct link to cancer, liver disease and even mental health problems. While alcohol may have a deep cultural legacy, it doesn’t get a free pass when it comes to our health,” Andrew asserts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-the-latest-science-says"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What the Latest Science Says &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cancer Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Alcohol is a known carcinogen that increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon, liver, mouth, esophagus, voice box and throat cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The U.S. Surgeon General’s January 2025 advisory tells it to us straight: Alcohol now ranks as the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, responsible for around 100,000 cases and 20,000 deaths each year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Though it may be tempting to toss this risk aside, the reality is that alcohol’s connection to cancer isn’t just about the statistics—it’s rooted in biology. “When alcohol is metabolized, it produces acetaldehyde, a toxic byproduct that damages DNA and prevents cells from repairing themselves, creating the perfect storm for cancer development,” says&lt;a href="https://thyroidcancerdietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Julia Diaz, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a thyroid cancer dietitian nutritionist.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It doesn’t stop there: Diaz warns that alcohol also throws your hormones out of balance, spiking estrogen levels and upping breast cancer risks. On top of that, it drains your body of vital nutrients needed to fight off damage, leaving you even more vulnerable to cancer development.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But these effects only kick in when you down too many drinks, right? Guess again. Studies undeniably show that even one drink a day increases your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Although drinking in moderation is often encouraged, the evidence tells a different story: there’s no safe level of alcohol consumption when it comes to cancer risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Heart Disease Risk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking in moderation poured into popularity with the belief that sipping on wine could benefit your heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For years, we were told that a glass of red wine a day keeps the cardiologist away—but science is making it clear: that’s a myth, not a health strategy,” says Andrews.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, what’s the real deal? “The idea that moderate alcohol is ‘heart-healthy’ came from flawed studies full of confounding variables (aka, sneaky factors that distorted the data),” she explains. “Many moderate drinkers in these studies also had healthier lifestyles overall—they exercised, ate nutritious foods and had better access to health care. Meanwhile, heavier drinkers often had additional health risks, making alcohol look better than it actually is.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The truth? Alcohol, even in small amounts, can elevate blood pressure and weaken the heart muscle, leading to increased risk of heart disease, stroke and heart failure over time, says &lt;a href="https://upliftfitnutrition.com/about-lacey-dunn/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lacey Dunn, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a functional medicine dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, if you’ve been winding down with a glass of wine in hopes of protecting your heart, the latest research suggests it may be doing more harm than good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Anxiety, Depression and Cognitive Decline Risks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking may seem like a way to calm life’s storms, but it often adds more weight to the burdens we’re trying to lighten. “People often drink to cope with anxiety or depression, but alcohol actually disrupts our brain chemistry, making these conditions worse long-term,” says White.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Recent studies have identified specific mechanisms by which alcohol alters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate systems, explaining why anxiety often worsens after drinking,” says White.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She notes that alcohol is a depressant, and our body produces cortisol and adrenaline to counteract its effects. This means that as you sip to find relief from anxiety, you are actually reinforcing a loop that keeps you tethered to the emotions you’re trying to outrun. As a result, you end up feeling more anxious the next day. White shares that drinking to cope with negative emotions is one of the strongest predictors of developing alcohol use disorder.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The irony? Every glass chips away at your brain’s natural ability to manage those feelings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But it’s not just about how you feel. It’s also about how alcohol impacts your memory. “New research indicates alcohol specifically targets the hippocampus, affecting both short-term memory formation and the consolidation of memories during sleep,” says White.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This not only impacts daily cognitive function but may also contribute to poor decision-making around drinking itself, creating a challenging cycle to break.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Liver Damage &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The liver, in particular, bears much of the brunt, as it’s responsible for breaking down alcohol and removing toxins from the body. Over time, alcohol can pile on the pressure, causing the liver to become overloaded and inflamed. Andrews expresses that this sets the stage for fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis and, in the worst-case scenario, cirrhosis—where the liver is scarred beyond repair and its ability to function goes downhill.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Immune Suppression &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Andrews points out that alcohol takes a toll on the immune system, leaving the body more susceptible to infections and slower healing. “Chronic drinking lowers the production of white blood cells, your body’s natural defense system, increasing the risk of illnesses like pneumonia, tuberculosis and even COVID-19 complications,” she emphasizes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think that nightcap is helping you sleep? It’s actually doing the opposite. “While alcohol can make you drowsy, it fragments sleep cycles and suppresses REM sleep, the deep stage crucial for memory, learning and cognitive function,” says Andrews.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She explains that alcohol reduces sleep quality by increasing nighttime awakenings and decreasing restorative sleep. White shares that newer research shows it also disrupts our slow-wave sleep, which is crucial for physical restoration and memory consolidation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Now that you know the science, it’s hard to ignore that the pull to drink still lingers, even with the logical awareness of the consequences. After all, alcohol is deeply woven into our social celebrations, cultural traditions and even daily routines. But perhaps, for a moment, you may pause to reflect on your habits—how the last drink made you feel and how it might impact your health in the future. If you are considering cutting back, here are some simple, actionable steps you can take to limit or completely avoid alcohol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Taking a Break from Booze &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As more people embrace initiatives like Dry January and Sober October, taking a break from alcohol has now become more socially acceptable than ever before. As a licensed therapist, White recommends starting with a 30- to 90-day break to get a clear picture of your relationship with alcohol. “This period allows you to identify triggers and develop new coping mechanisms,” she explains. She outlines that it’s about digging into whether those triggers are emotional, tied to your environment, linked to certain exposures or even connected to certain times of the day or year. If it would be helpful, consider reaching out to a professional or someone close to you to guide and hold you accountable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rethinking Moderation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to drinking alcohol, health institutions recommend moderation. As a reference, the National Institutes of Health defines moderate drinking as up to one drink a day for women and up to two for men.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But, as we’ve seen, even moderate drinking is risky business. Even if you only drink on special occasions or weekend outings, you may find it helpful to explore life without alcohol entirely. In doing so, you may discover how much healthier you feel, how your relationships strengthen and the unexpected ways your overall quality of life improves. But, whether you set weekly limits or put down the glass completely, it’s about finding what aligns with your personal goals and health needs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Considering Your Social Scenarios &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Drinking culture is deeply ingrained in many social settings—parties, family gatherings, dating and even casual get-togethers—but we have the power to rewrite the script,” says Andrews. The good news is that, nowadays, it’s pretty easy to find nonalcoholic options in bars and restaurants. However, if you know you’re heading to a place where options might be limited, Diaz recommends bringing your own nonalcoholic drink to share. Participating in activities that don’t revolve around drinking, like hiking, yoga or game nights, is also a great way to have fun alcohol-free. But what do you do when your friends start pouring the pressure as freely as the drinks? Diaz highlights the importance of filling your social circle with people who respect your decisions and align with your goals.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finding new ways to celebrate and unwind without alcohol can help build lasting change. Maren shares that one of her top tips is to create a new “anchor”—a special drink that feels celebratory but isn’t alcohol. “In psychology, anchors are the things we associate with a habit, and for many people, drinking is as much about the ritual as it is about the alcohol itself. Rather than feeling like you’re giving something up, replace it with a new ritual,” she wisely advises. From &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7923275/best-nonalcoholic-wines-according-to-a-sommelier/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alcohol-free wines&lt;/a&gt;, beers and spirits to a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7883572/elderberry-elixir-mocktail/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fancy mocktail&lt;/a&gt;, you can still enjoy the flavors of alcoholic beverages without the actual booze. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With the U.S. Surgeon General’s warning about the impact of alcohol and cancer risk, it’s crucial to take a closer look at how alcohol affects our overall health. From its impact on heart health and mental well-being to liver function, immune support and sleep quality, understanding these risks empowers us to make more informed, mindful choices about alcohol consumption. Whether you choose to cut back completely, consume on occasion or take periodic breaks throughout the year, having this knowledge allows you to make choices that align with your health goals. The conversation about alcohol is evolving, and now’s the time to truly ask ourselves what role it plays in our lives and whether it’s time for a change.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — An unknown illness first discovered in three children who ate a bat has rapidly killed more than 50 people in northwestern Congo over the past five weeks, health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interval between the onset of symptoms – which include fever, vomiting and internal bleeding – and death has been 48 hours in most cases and “that’s what’s really worrying,” said Serge Ngalebato, medical director of Bikoro Hospital, a regional monitoring center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These “hemorrhagic fever” symptoms are commonly linked to known deadly viruses, such as Ebola, dengue, Marburg and yellow fever, but researchers have ruled these out based on tests of more than a dozen samples collected so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo began on Jan. 21, with 419 cases recorded and 53 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours, the Africa office of the World Health Organization said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have long been concerns about diseases jumping from animals to humans in places where wild animals are popularly eaten. The number of such outbreaks in Africa has surged by more than 60% in the last decade, the WHO said in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the second outbreak of the mystery disease began in the village of Bomate on Feb. 9, samples from 13 cases were sent to the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for testing, the WHO said. All samples were negative for common hemorrhagic fever diseases, although some tested positive for malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, another mystery flu-like illness that killed dozens of people in another part of Congo was determined likely to be malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The lab finding does raise the possibility that this new bat virus could spread from animals to humans, researchers said in a paper published Tuesday in the journal Cell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Wuhan virus research center is known for its work on bat coronaviruses. One theory of how the COVID pandemic began is that it leaked from that lab, perhaps through an infected worker. Institute researchers have previously denied working on any viruses that could have started the pandemic. The US in 2023 halted funding for the lab, which had received money through the US-based EcoHealth Alliance, amid the controversy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This newly discovered bat virus infects cells by binding to a protein found throughout the bodies of humans and other mammals.

The virus is transmitted by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Measles virus can remain infectious in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Illness onset (high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes) begins a week or two after someone is exposed. A few days later, the telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and trunk to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;A person is contagious about four days before the rash appears to four days after. People with measles should stay home from work or school during that period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms of Measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Common symptoms for measles include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;High fever (as high as 105°F)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Runny nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness.

Two doses of the MMR vaccine are highly effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;Some vaccinated people can occasionally develop measles; however, they generally experience milder symptoms and are less likely to spread the disease to other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you've been exposed to measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p data-v-4557dbf7&gt;If you think you have measles or have been exposed to someone with measles, isolate yourself from others and call your healthcare provider before arriving to be tested so they can prepare for your arrival without exposing other people to the virus. Measles is extremely contagious and can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus. Review your and your child’s vaccination history to see if you are up-to-date on your measles vaccines. Additionally, discuss with your provider your vaccination history and any questions about these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlling outbreaks in group settings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul original-article-post="" data-v-03e8ff79 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;People with confirmed or suspected measles should stay home from school, work, and other group settings until after the fourth day of rash onset.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;During an outbreak, people without documented immunity from vaccination or previous measles infection should be isolated from anyone with measles to protect those without immunity and control the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="article-ct" data-v-03e8ff79&gt;&lt;span data-v-03e8ff79&gt;According to the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) Rule §97.7, schools and childcare settings shall exclude unimmunized children for at least 21 days after the last date the unimmunized child was exposed to a measles case.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;div original-article-post="" class="group-source-title" data-v-4fbf7207 data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;p class="group-source-paragraph" data-v-4fbf7207&gt;&lt;b data-v-4fbf7207&gt;The Source:&lt;/b&gt; Information in this article comes from the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-4557dbf7&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 18:12:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOMEczWmZmdkt3RkcxUV9uVWlrZGl1VS1xWjIwa2M0NU8tbldIeFhqVHBrWDdkRVQzOVg2MzRfamVSa3lPalBYM3hrZVZ1SkYycDQ5TTRVV3p1VU1EZ1hNU25NbVpuT3lmcC0wbExEUWdHcTVPZ0dhVmNJck1sY0EwNFdMWG_SAYoBQVVfeXFMTlh3OURHLUs5aWVtWFhkOXZEbVE1eVNMRzBuakRfal9UUjR1RU15OUl0dHQ1TWtFNEw3b2xLTzNXRlc1MnRKSERTT0JZQ3ZtWHpOeTFMaFozZU9lTkw4SUs0X1lvMHRCMVpGQWpXenhvcXBUSnNoRnFkSmFSN19YZnE0RnFwSWV5c0ZR</guid></item><item><title>Diabetes drugs show promise for mental health treatment - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPZVliSm5RWmJRSFFoRXB6aWZKa3g2OHRJSWZoZW81dlozX19Uc2tvSll6VGlEREZsckdwajRqeHpwYkJmbXNrd1ViVFN3QThGN2poUHBfZlg1ODVxMnpLRUl4LWJsRTRCeU1aY1RmbHR0dUhyem1NM2tyZk9UM181Q2tXb3R6MXgxYWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugs approved for diabetes and obesity might be useful for the treatment of cognitive and mental health disorders, according to a new paper &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00390-x" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Oxford have conducted a comprehensive overview of the potential benefits or harms of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) such as semaglutide (better known as Ozempic/Wegovy) in various mental health conditions. This important study explores the mechanisms and possible clinical uses of these drugs, commonly used for diabetes and obesity, on cognitive and psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study reviewed and integrated data from both preclinical and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical studies&lt;/a&gt; to gather evidence on the possible effects of these drugs in conditions such as dementia, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/substance+use+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;substance use disorders&lt;/a&gt;, psychotic disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riccardo De Giorgi, clinical lecturer in the University of Oxford's Department of Psychiatry and NIHR OH BRC researcher said, "This study is the result of an astounding team effort to compile the most comprehensive summary of evidence to date regarding the mechanisms and potential clinical uses of GLP-1RAs (i.e., medications such as Ozempic) in a variety of cognitive and mental illnesses, including dementia, addiction, psychotic and mood disorders, and disordered eating. We hope that any further study in this key research area can draw useful data from our report."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found promising but still preliminary evidence that GLP-1RAs could be beneficial over a range of cognitive and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt;. These drugs have shown potential in improving cognition, reducing addictive behavior, and alleviating depression and anxiety. More data from robustly designed studies (i.e., randomized controlled trials) are needed to better understand GLP-1RAs' prospective efficacy and safety profile, especially with long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, no clinical recommendation can be given regarding the use of GLP-1RAs in mental illness. Nevertheless, these findings unlock intriguing research opportunities to further explore the effects of GLP-1RAs on mental health. Continued investigation into the mechanisms by which these medications affect mental health is essential. This should include further mechanistic studies (e.g., experimental medicine trials) that can support the interpretation of findings from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, endocrinologists, psychiatrists, and neuroscientists will collaborate to develop integrated treatment approaches to target the unmet needs of patients whose illness may be seen at the interface between these medical specialties.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A person’s precious organ donation came with an unexpected visitor. In a new paper out this month, scientists have documented an unconventional way of catching a rare germ normally spread by ticks: from a person’s infected donated kidney.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors and health officials detailed the unusual mishap in a report &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1723_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in the journal &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;. Both the living donor and recipient became sick soon after their operations, leading doctors to discover that the former had transmitted an infection caused by &lt;em&gt;Ehrlichia &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. Fortunately, the tainted transfer was detected in time and both patients were treated successfully.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ticks are prolific carriers of many germs, including the germs behind Lyme disease, relapsing fever, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ehrlichiosis/about/index.html"&gt;ehrlichiosis&lt;/a&gt;. Several species of bacteria cause ehrlichiosis, though most cases are tied to &lt;em&gt;Ehrlichia chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt;. The disease is rarely documented, though cases have been increasing over time. In 2022, there were 1,570 reported cases of ehrlichiosis compared to 201 cases in 2000, when the disease first became nationally tracked. But this most recent case is even rarer than usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report authors, the donor was a 33-year-old man from Minnesota who agreed to donate his kidney to an unrelated recipient. He had no obvious red flags, passing all the typical screening tests, which include looking for infections that could be dangerous if passed onto a transplant recipient. His recipient was a 24-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease from Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Both men’s operations went smoothly. But on the same day after his kidney was removed, the donor developed a rash on his left hip and leg along with muscle pain and weakness. Doctors diagnosed him with rhabdomyolysis, a condition where muscle tissue rapidly breaks down and releases proteins that damage organs, particularly the kidney. Doctors stabilized him quickly, and he recovered well enough to be discharged six days after the operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recipient, meanwhile, appeared fine at first. But a week after the transplant, he was admitted to the hospital with fever, joint pain, and fluid build-up around his kidneys. Given the man’s other symptoms, including a low platelet count, the doctors tested him for various tickborne germs, which eventually confirmed the presence of &lt;em&gt;E. chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt; bacteria. He was given a new course of antibiotics standard for these infections and eventually recovered as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All ehrlichiosis cases in the U.S. must be reported to state health agencies. The recipient’s organ transplantation, coupled with the fact that he had no other risk factor for ehrlichiosis (such as traveling recently to tick-laden parts of the U.S.), prompted a wider investigation by health officials in both Wisconsin and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, they discovered that the donor had traveled to Kansas for a hunting trip a month before his operation, and that he had to remove several ticks from his clothing and body while there. He also felt sick a week before the transplant, though he attributed it to simple food poisoning. Other tests found evidence of the bacteria in the donor and in the transplanted kidney.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The laboratory evidence, exposure history, and epidemiology of ehrlichiosis strongly support donor-derived transmission of &lt;em&gt;E. chaffeensis&lt;/em&gt; initially acquired by the donor through a tick bite in Kansas 3 weeks before donation,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transplanted cases of ehrlichiosis are exceedingly rare, but not unheard of—and they can be deadly. A 2021 paper, for instance, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8906657/"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; two deaths likely caused by ehrlichiosis caught from a single deceased donor’s kidneys in 2020. The typical fatality rate is around 1%, though roughly 60% of patients still get hospitalized as a result. But ehrlichiosis and other infections are generally more dangerous for transplant recipients, since they have to take immune-suppressing drugs to avoid organ rejection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Given how rare this disease is, the doctors say it wouldn’t be justified to routinely screen for it in donors. But transplant doctors should keep an eye out for the potential risk posed by ehrlichiosis and other germs normally spread by ticks. “In summary, clinicians should remain vigilant for tickborne infections in potential organ donors, particularly those with known exposure to common disease vectors,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Spoiler: These tiny seeds are absolutely packed with nutrients, making them a powerhouse ingredient you can add to a range of dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike some buzzy nutritional foods, chia seeds have some solid scientific research to back up their health halo. In fact, a recent study found that these seeds can do your health a solid on a range of fronts, including lowering your blood pressure and cholesterol, and even helping you to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the deal with chia seeds, plus why nutrition experts are all about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;; Christy Brissette, RD, nutritionist and owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition;;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39299649/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prostaglandins &amp;amp; Other Lipid Mediators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prostaglandins &amp;amp; Other Lipid Mediators&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;last September, analyzed data from 14 clinical trials that involved 835 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study found that adding chia seeds to your diet could help lower your cholesterol and your risk of cardiovascular disease, control blood pressure, and help manage weight. Specifically, researchers noted a drop in LDL (bad) cholesterol and blood pressure and a “notable” drop in the levels of triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood that’s linked to heart disease, in individuals who consumed higher amounts of chia seeds. This was actually apparent in people who ate both higher amounts—more than 35 grams—and lower amounts—less than 35 grams—of chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the health benefits of chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds have a lot of good things going for them. Fun fact: The Aztecs dubbed them ‘running food’ because they were used as a vital energy source during long expeditions when food supplies were scarce, says Christy Brissette, RD, nutritionist and owner of &lt;a href="https://80twentynutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:80 Twenty Nutrition.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;80 Twenty Nutrition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, these tiny seeds are a good source of soluble and insoluble fiber, both of which are good for your digestive health, Brissette says. "Not only does it help you stay regular [with bowel movements], the fiber in chia seeds can help you feel more full and support weight management,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soluble fiber can also prevent post-meal blood sugar spikes and helps trap cholesterol to remove it from your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are also nutrient-dense, serving up plenty of fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, and micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, and iron, points out Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. “The omega-3s they contain contribute to anti-inflammatory benefits and may support heart health by improving lipid profiles,” he says. “Additionally, their antioxidant content helps combat oxidative stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9834868/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;scientific analysis &lt;/a&gt;even found that the antioxidants and polyphenols in chia seeds may help to lower the risk of several cancers, including breast, colorectal, liver, and pancreatic cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do chia seeds impact the body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can do a few things for you. “Chia seeds absorb water and form a gel, which slows digestion and can promote fullness, potentially aiding weight management,” Keatley says. (Because they absorb liquid, just be aware that eating them dry in large amounts could cause digestive issues, like bloating and gas.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s hard to say that adding any one food to your diet will cause a big change in your health. But chia seeds have the potential to add these perks to your life when they’re coupled with other healthy lifestyle habits, according to &lt;a href="https://njms-web.njms.rutgers.edu/profile/myProfile.php?mbmid=dhk84" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Danbee Kim;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Danbee Kim&lt;/a&gt;, MD, nutrition expert and assistant professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promote better digestion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help with weight management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower bodily inflammation to help protect against chronic disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help with diabetes blood sugar management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much should I be consuming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a universally recommended dose for chia seeds. Nutrition experts generally recommend aiming for a tablespoon a day. If you end up having more than that, great. If you're consuming less, don't worry. You’re still getting plenty of nutrients and reaping the health benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just remember: “To prevent digestive discomfort, it's important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water,” Dr. Kim says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best ways to eat chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are surprisingly versatile, Brissette says. She recommends sprinkling them on &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a45645043/passion-dragon-fruit-chia-pudding-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a40592712/baked-pumpkin-oatmeal-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:oatmeal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a24733894/are-acai-bowls-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acai bowls;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;acai bowls&lt;/a&gt;. “They’re also great on top of salads or on avocado toast, or as chia pudding,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim also suggests adding whole or ground chia seeds to smoothies, juices, pancake batter, and baked goods like muffins and bread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brissette even uses chia seeds to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a63904726/best-high-protein-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:replace eggs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;replace eggs&lt;/a&gt; in baking. “Just mix one tablespoon of chia seeds with three tablespoons of water,” she says. “Let it sit for five minutes and it will form a gel and then add to your wet ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any risks or side effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds can cause bloating or gas if you’re not used to a high-fiber diet, Keatley says. So, start slow before ramping up consumption. And since chia seeds absorb liquid and expand, eating them dry could even pose a choking hazard, Keatley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seed allergies do exist, so if you have one, stay away from this health food. (If you’re unsure, Dr. Kim says that chia seed allergies tend to overlap with sesame seed allergies.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kim also recommends being aware that chia seeds may alter the effect of some medications, including drugs used for diabetes and blood pressure, along with blood thinners. They may also interact with some supplements you’re taking. The fiber and phytic acid in chia seeds “may reduce zinc, calcium, and iron absorption,” Dr. Kim says. Basically, if you’re on one of these medications or take a supplement, it’s a good idea to check in with your doctor before adding a steady stream of chia seeds to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have chia seeds in your diet right now, nutritionists recommend giving them a try. “I'm a chia seed superfan,” Brissette says. “They’re nutritional rock stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 17:07:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBtR01GQzFOcG55VzdTTkJscnVtOHl6M3h0ZHZ2YnFJOHJrbl9zNElfanJHYU44enBUai1VX0dGbUJ6VW9nbEpNdVI1bWNBY1RtMjFBSnpNS1pRV3BGWWlhZjA4eUJpVEhXXzNTS2NDQlI2MW03cW4xTw</guid></item><item><title>Brewing tea removes lead from water - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOdjd4amJQeTM2VjF0bUIyVzhWVElrUExNNDlPcFExTVg4RUlNTml5V212aVFlRXQ0cl9JTzdkc0hmUTZnV1MyU2NVTmQxTXVqOXhtX216bXMwMFdPalVmdzFJeFJWQzM0MHhSNDEtSEEtajg0U0h5bl9YSWpXdW5zQUlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the authors purchased Lipton and Infusions commercial tea bags, as well as a variety of loose-leaf teas and herbal alternatives: black tea, green tea, white peony tea, oolong tea, rooibos tea, and chamomile tea. The tea bags were of different types (cotton, cellulose, and nylon). They brewed the tea the same way daily tea drinkers do, steeping the tea for various time intervals (mere seconds to 24 hours) in water spiked with elevated known levels of lead, chromium, copper zinc, and cadmium. Tea leaves were removed after steeping by pouring the tea through a cellulose filter into a separate tube. The team then measured how much of the toxic metals remained in the water and how much the leaves had adsorbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the type of tea bag matters. The team found that cellulose tea bags work the best at adsorbing toxic metals from the water while cotton and nylon tea bags barely adsorbed any contaminants at all—and nylon bags also release contaminating microplastics to boot. Tea type and the grind level also played a part in adsorbing toxic metals, with finely ground black tea leaves performing the best on that score. This is because when those leaves are processed, they get wrinkled, which opens the pores, thereby adding more surface area. Grinding the tea further increases that surface area, with even more capacity for binding toxic metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the most significant factor was steeping time: the longer the steeping time, the more toxic metals were adsorbed. Based on their experiments, the authors estimate that brewing tea—using a tea bag that steeps for three to five minutes in a mug—can remove about 15 percent of lead from drinking water, even water with concentrations as high as 10 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard the saying that the &lt;strong&gt;eyes are the windows to the soul&lt;/strong&gt;, but new research shows they are also connected to how we breathe. Scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Groningen in the Netherlands have confirmed that&lt;strong&gt; pupil size&lt;/strong&gt; fluctuates in sync with breathing, revealing a deeper link between our vision and bodily rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Well-known Triggers Of Pupil Changes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have studied pupil size to understand attention, emotion, and medical conditions. Three key factors were known to influence how pupils react: light exposure, cognitive effort and focus and emotional arousal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;German researcher &lt;strong&gt;Irene Loewenfeld&lt;/strong&gt; once stated: “Man may either blush or turn pale when emotionally agitated, but his pupils always dilate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These pupil responses are so consistent and reliable that they are often used in psychology, neuroscience, and medical diagnoses. If a pupil fails to react to light, for example, it can signal a neurological emergency &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/10/consumed-by-many-this-oil-could-increase-the-risk-of-stroke/"&gt;such as a stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Newly Discovered “Pupillary Respiratory Phase Response”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have confirmed a fourth factor influencing pupil size: breathing. In a newly identified phenomenon called pupillary respiratory phase response, pupils tend to be largest during exhalation and smallest at the start of inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that our vision may switch between optimizing for distinguishing small details when we inhale and detecting faint objects when we exhale, all within a single breathing cycle,” said Martin Schaefer, postdoctoral researcher,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This effect is entirely internal, originating within the body rather than as a reaction to external stimuli. The &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381860248_The_Respiratory-Pupillary_Phase_Effect_Pupil_size_is_smallest_around_inhalation_onset_and_largest_during_exhalation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research team&lt;/a&gt; reviewed past studies and found anecdotal hints of this connection &lt;strong&gt;dating back over 50 years&lt;/strong&gt;, but prior evidence remained inconclusive at best.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants were also asked to modify their breathing patterns, switching between nose and mouth breathing and adjusting their breathing rate. “Pupil size remained smallest around the onset of inhalation and largest during exhalation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Tool For Diagnosing Brain Disorders?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In medicine, pupil reactions are already used to assess brain function. For instance, if pupils fail to respond to light, it could signal a neurological emergency such as a stroke or brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;With this new discovery, researchers suggest that irregularities in the connection between breathing and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/ai-can-spot-your-stroke-risk-through-a-simple-eye-test/"&gt;pupil&lt;/a&gt; size might serve as an early indicator of neurological disorders. Conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/uncovering-alzheimers-could-herpes-be-a-key-player/"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, or even anxiety disorders could potentially disrupt this newly identified breathing-pupil link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Where Do We Go From Here?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that researchers have confirmed the link between breathing and pupil size, the next step is to explore its broader significance. Future studies may investigate whether manipulating breathing patterns can enhance focus or visual clarity, potentially offering new techniques for improving cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, they may examine whether other internal rhythms, such as heartbeat or blood flow, influence pupil behavior, further uncovering how the body and brain work in sync. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This discovery suggests that, in ways we are only beginning to understand, our bodies actively shape our experience of reality—one breath at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
