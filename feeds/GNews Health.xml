&lt;p&gt;Two cases of measles have been confirmed in New York City as of the end of February, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York City Health Department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials didn’t disclose the ages or vaccination status of the two cases, but they are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuXleWGn7kE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;urging parents&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The news comes as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/02/us-news/measles-alert-issued-in-new-jersey-county-following-three-confirmed-cases/"&gt;New Jersey has issued a measles alert&lt;/a&gt; in response to three confirmed cases in Bergen County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City has confirmed two measles cases as of the end of February. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to NYC’s health department, the two cases are unrelated, with one occurring earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For each case, our agency conducts routine case and contact investigation and we ensure proper follow-ups for exposed persons.” acting commissioner of the NYC Health Department Dr. Michelle Morse told &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/03/03/measles-new-york-city/81204974007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city had 14 cases in 2024, making up nearly all of New York State’s 15 total cases. The rest of New York State has no confirmed cases yet this year.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Measles were declared officially eliminated in the US in 2000, but cases have been on the rise in recent years. According to the CDC, there have been 164 cases across the US as of Feb. 27, spreading across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas. Twenty percent of those cases have resulted in hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Texas has had the biggest outbreak with 146 cases, and last week reported the country’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/us-news/texas-measles-cases-rise-to-146-in-an-outbreak-that-led-to-a-childs-death/"&gt;first measles death&lt;/a&gt; since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles, also called rubeola, shows no symptoms for the first 10 to 14 days after infection. Those who are infected then typically experience cough, sore throat, runny nose, pink eye, white spots inside the mouth, a blotchy skin rash and fever, which can rise as high as 104 to 105.8 F.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Public health officials are urging people to vaccinate their children after the US recorded its first measles death since 2015. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s also highly contagious — people with measles can spread it for several days before the rash even appears. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the New York City Health Department. if a person has measles, 90% of those around them who are not vaccinated or immune through previous infection will get it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials have urged usage of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as individual protection against the virus and to promote herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a pediatrician and the State’s doctor, I want to remind everyone that immunization is safe and the best protection for your children against measles and other potentially deadly diseases,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a PSA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a very contagious, serious respiratory disease that causes rash and fever. In some cases, measles can reduce the immune system’s ability to fight other infections like pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The city had 14 cases in 2024, making up nearly all of New York State’s 15 total cases.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I encourage anyone not vaccinated against measles to receive at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and get their children vaccinated with two doses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morse added to &lt;a href="https://pix11.com/news/local-news/new-york-city-reports-measles-cases-raising-public-health-concern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PIX11&lt;/a&gt;: “If you get the vaccine, the risk for measles for you is incredibly small, it leads to 97% coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it’s very rare to get measles if you’re fully vaccinated, breakthrough infections do happen, with the CDC noting that they make up about 5% of total infections.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are common in places where there in an outbreak, meaning there are more people with the virus, increasing potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/us-news/rfk-jr-calls-for-new-age-of-radical-transparency-at-hhs-tells-critics-they-can-retire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; — who has been outspoken in his vaccine skepticism — promoted the measles jab &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us?title=op-ed%20for%20Fox%20News" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in a Fox News Digital op-ed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness with certain health risks, especially to unvaccinated individuals,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prior to the introduction of the vaccine in the 1960s, virtually every child in the United States contracted measles,” he went on, pointing to a fatality rate of 1 in 1,205 cases from 1953 to 1962.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

channel - Legion the Dragon - to share snippets of their everyday life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Texas-born Legion the Dragon (pictured), otherwise known as Tiamat Legion Medusa, has spent more than $83,500 (£61,000) on modification surgeries including ear removal, tongue splitting, castration and countless tattoos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discussing their transformation, Legion said: '[In the dream] I found myself surrounded by snakes, of all colours and the snakes were all biting me, and I was very much afraid, but as the dream went on and they kept on biting me, I could see that I was not being hurt by them or their bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was when I realised this that my fear began to subside, and I felt safe and at peace, and I was not afraid of the snakes, then I woke up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I can still &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-82f157d0-f833-11ef-9b60-f712d659212a" class="class"&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt; the dream so vividly as if it happened last night, and it was then that I knew there was an important message for me in my dream – it was an omen that I was one of them, a sign of things to come in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Today, I believe that when those snakes were biting me in my dream that they were in effect injecting me with their venom as a way to give me that venom making me like them, which is why today I am a venom-spitting dragon, as opposed to being a fire-breathing dragon like many people incorrectly assume.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their identity crisis began as a child, when Legion alleges they faced abuse that led to a 'disconnect' from the human race.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-e4c37510-f833-11ef-9b60-f712d659212a" class="class"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; in 1997 and decided to change their life completely by 'shedding' parts of their humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 'reptoid' has recently launched a YouTube account with clips from their everyday life (pictured) after taking a break from social media &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Legion was born Richard Hernandez, and before beginning their transformation (pictured left), they were a successful VP at a bank. They were diagnosed with HIV in 1997 and decided to change their life &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; They identify as a venom spitting dragon and want to become totally genderless after undergoing several body modification surgeries in the past 23 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Richard at the beginning of their transformation, when they still had ears and a human nose.

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine to prevent breast cancer is showing good results, and moving into the next stage of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This vaccine is designed eventually to prevent breast cancer,” said Amit Kumar, CEO of&lt;a href="https://www.anixa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Anixa Biosciences&lt;/a&gt;. “So, one day, we hope to be able to give it to pretty much every woman in the world who’s worried about breast cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anixa is developing the vaccine, which is entering phase two of a clinical trial at the&lt;a href="https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2024/11/08/cleveland-clinic-announces-updated-findings-in-preventive-breast-cancer-vaccine-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures/2024/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society facts and figures for 2024-2025&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 1 in 8 women (13%) will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, and 1 in 43 (2.3%) will die from the disease. An additional 2,790 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 530 are expected to die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This trial is initially focused on the most lethal form of breast cancer, which is known as triple-negative breast cancer,” Kumar told WTOP. “But we anticipate that it’ll work for other types of breast cancer as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine targets a lactation protein, alpha-lactalbumin, which is not found after lactation in normal aging breast tissues but is present in most triple-negative breast cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer begins with a single cell, then doubles to two, then four, then eight, cells — eventually becoming a multibillion cell tumor that can be seen on a mammogram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If [the vaccine] has properly trained in that patient’s immune system, at the 2-cell, 4-cell or 8-cell stage, the immune system will destroy those cells, and so they never have a chance to become a tumor,” said Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;How the breast cancer vaccine has been tested so far&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the phase one trial, a group of 26 patients was broken down into three categories, said Kumar. In this phase, researchers are studying whether the drug is effective and safe and identifying the optimal dosage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group A was made up of women already diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer — an aggressive form that is notoriously difficult to treat. These patients have already gone through treatment — including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation — and are currently cancer-free, but at high risk for recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anywhere from 40% to 80% of these women will have a recurrence within 5 years,” said Kumar. “So we’re giving them the vaccine to see if we can teach their immune systems to target the cancer, if and when it returns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group B is made up of patients who are cancer-free, but at high genetic risk, and have elected to voluntarily have a preventative mastectomy to lower their risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to vaccinate these women before their surgeries, and after their surgery we’re going to be able to examine their purportedly healthy tissue,” said Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third cohort, Group C, are patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer who received chemotherapy and surgery, and are being treated with immunotherapy. Liquid biopsy shows these patients have traces of cancer remaining in their blood, which puts them at high risk for developing another tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to give these women the vaccine in addition to existing standard of care therapy, to see if the vaccine can act synergistically and prevent their cancers from coming back,” Kumar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results have been promising, and the side effects minimal, said Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Over three-quarters of these women are showing a good, robust immune response, and others are showing a modest immune response,” he said. “The only side effect these women felt was irritation at the site of injection, so no headaches, no pain, no abnormal laboratory values.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;What’s next in the clinical trial&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In phase two — the larger part of the study — Kumar said they’ll be treating women who have just recently been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, and are heading toward surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Typically, standard of care is to give these women chemotherapy in what’s known as the ‘neoadjuvant setting,’ which is before surgery,” said Kumar. “The intent is to reduce their tumor burden, so perhaps surgery can be less aggressive and also to lessen the chance of a recurrence after the surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of the women in phase two of the study will get that current standard-of-care treatment. The other half will receive standard-of-care treatment and also get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re hoping that the vaccine group fares much better than the standard of care group, which is what we expect,” said Kumar. “The question is, will it be 60% effective, 80% effective, or is it 100% effective? — which is what we saw in the animal studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, an even-larger phase three trial would have half the number of patients receiving the vaccine, the other half getting a placebo, in addition to standard of care treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumar said the plan is for the vaccine to come to market in stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The first will be for women battling breast cancer, the second will be for patients who have already had breast cancer and worry about it returning. And the third will be women who have never had breast cancer, to prevent breast cancer in the future,” said Kumar. “We believe that the first application, for women who are battling breast cancer, could be available within four to five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

But although &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017399000600?via=ihub"&gt;swearing&lt;/a&gt; is a near-universal feature of language, it is still considered taboo by many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5VK6DRZEPBG7JIDXZIIVDGU7HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/olly-robertson"&gt;Olly Robertson&lt;/a&gt; is not one of them. “It’s something that we all share, and it is really magical.

With that knowledge, Stephens said, swearing can more effectively be used in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="OCOKSUCSHRA6XBZVO3R5DXI7MM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="OCOKSUCSHRA6XBZVO3R5DXI7MM"&gt;Pain reduction through swearing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IUL72LAJANDNNIBG3H6IYSO3YE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2009, Stephens and his colleagues published the first &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/abstract/2009/08050/swearing_as_a_response_to_pain.4.aspx"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; linking swearing with hypoalgesia — a reduced sensitivity to pain. Subjects were asked to participate in a cold pressor task, in which they held their hands in ice water for as long as possible while repeating either a swear word of their choosing or a non-swear word. Swearing was associated with not only increased pain tolerance but also decreased perceived pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="67JQJZSGVFF3ZCATHY5K45UXWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Studies followed showing similar, yet sometimes varied, effects. In 2020, for instance, Stephens and Robertson &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00723/full"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; the use of the swear “f---” compared with a neutral word and two made-up swear words — “fouch” and “twizpipe” — and found that swearing was linked with increased pain tolerance but had no significant effect on pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MXVVAG2D7FFZRL7RDJKYT2SIQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That association between swearing and increased pain tolerance is not specific to the English language. In 2017, Robertson and Stephens published a &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1016/j.sjpain.2017.07.014/html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigating the cross-cultural effect of swearing on pain, comparing Japanese and English speakers. In Japan, Robertson said, swearing is not socially ingrained the way it is in Britain, so she doubted that it would have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MD2TFJHQ3NAFLEVZNWHD7OHT7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While doing the cold presser task, native English speakers repeated either the swear “f---” or a control word — “cup” — and native Japanese speakers repeated a Japanese word that means s--- or a control word “kappu,” meaning cup. Regardless of language, swearing was linked with greater pain tolerance. “Which I wasn’t expecting at all, because I was expecting to see that social effect,” Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="LNYTCCNDWZCV5DDJS6DHTFRX2U" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="LNYTCCNDWZCV5DDJS6DHTFRX2U"&gt;Swearing has benefits beyond physical pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LCULTTNCTVD7NAWTDBUOZTPDXE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In addition to pain tolerance, swearing has been linked to bolstered &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216604000396?via=ihub"&gt;social bonds&lt;/a&gt;, improved &lt;a href="https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/uip/ajp/article-abstract/121/1/83/258589/Recalling-Taboo-and-Nontaboo-Words?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, and even an alleviation of the social pain of &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2264"&gt;exclusion&lt;/a&gt; or rejection. “Neurologically, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4869967/"&gt;pathways&lt;/a&gt; for physical pain and emotional pain are the same,” Robertson said. “So when you have heartbreak, it’s the same neural structures. It’s the same biological blueprint, and that’s why it feels so visceral, because it literally is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y5HRXOXP35FBRLKHXY4JWXWAEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More recently, swearing has been shown to be linked with an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1469029216301352" target="_blank"&gt;increase in strength&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the impact of swearing on strength was a logical progression, Stephens said, because he and others had shown that swearing while in pain often was associated with increased heart rate, similar to what happens during a “fight or flight” &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541120/"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;, where your body releases a surge of adrenaline and blood is diverted to your muscles to prepare for action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AOH2RPGP25DYFELOQKASJF6Y2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2018, Stephens and his colleagues found that, in an anaerobic power test on a bike, swearing was linked with an improvement in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1469029216301352" target="_blank"&gt;participant strength&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were unable to identify any physiological variable — including heart rate — that correlated with the finding. Stephens has since shifted his focus more to the psychological. “My research has been trying to understand what’s the psychological mechanism by which swearing brings about these effects, both for pain and for physical strength,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQPGQCINCJBP7IY4I3Q2CJEOSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But what exactly connects swearing with greater strength and pain tolerance remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6MZMJZPBINHINCVJEJVHGGPSXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Over the past few years, Stephens has focused on state disinhibition theory: “the idea that, by swearing, we just get ourselves in a place where we’re more disinhibited, and in a disinhibited state, we push ourselves further, go for it a little bit more,” he said. “So we’ll put up with the ice-cold water for a few more seconds, or [in a strength task] we’ll squeeze on the hand gripper with a little more force.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="WFXMWFGJA5A7PPMJ23J5UTFJIE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="WFXMWFGJA5A7PPMJ23J5UTFJIE"&gt;The optimal swearing dosage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEWAUX6IMFHDPO663Y2TW3LRKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Up until this point, testing the link between swearing and pain has been done in a controlled, laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7QSGEJPYYFBMDJOU346PVB5OUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samford.edu/healthprofessions/directory/Washmuth-Nick"&gt;Nick Washmuth&lt;/a&gt;, professor of physical therapy at Samford University in Alabama, is focused on the potential for swearing to be used in a clinical context, which means understanding not only the mechanisms by which swearing affects pain but also how a person’s environment, age, how much they already swear in their everyday lives, the intensity of the swear word and other variables could influence the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V4YETEN3UFCYHGB2K6FHITKCDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We need to better understand those factors and how they play a role to be able to prescribe swearing in a medical sense, in a clinical sense,” Washmuth said. “Is there an optimal dosage for swearing?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HO5KTL2LWRBKROSJIL24IGEQMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For those who would like to use swearing to help with pain or increase strength, Washmuth suggested starting by selecting a swear word that feels powerful, that you would naturally use if you stubbed your toe, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJJZDS53NJH7POMWITIMSW7LDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If no word comes to mind, the f-word is the most commonly self-selected swear word by participants in these studies and is considered one of the most powerful swear words out there,” he said. “Swear at a steady pace once a second to once every three seconds, at a normal speech volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TEQM4WVGFFDRTERDFAWODRYZ6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But if audible swearing is not your thing, do not despair.

Longevity experts even see reducing chronic inflammation as key to healthier aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a classic double-edged sword,” said Dr. David Hafler, a neurologist and professor of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Inflammation is necessary for survival, and without it our bodies wouldn’t be able to fight off intruders like viruses and bacteria. A sore throat, for example, turns red and is painful because the immune system is fighting the infection to prevent it from spreading, which doctors call acute inflammation, said Dr. Moshe Arditi, a pediatrician and director of the infectious and immunological diseases research center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Localized immune response in the acute stage — to a limited extent — is all beneficial inflammation,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The discovery of inflammation dates back centuries to the Roman encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celcus, one of the first people to define it. Celcus described the core signs of inflammation in Latin as &lt;em&gt;rubor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tumor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;calore&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;delore&lt;/em&gt;. The terms translate to redness, swelling, heat and pain, which still hold true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At a microscopic level, acute inflammation includes our bodies’ sending fluid, proteins and white blood cells to the sites of infections or injuries, which help fight foreign pathogens and promote healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While inflammation can be lifesaving in the short term, there is another type of inflammation, chronic inflammation, that can damage the body over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes chronic inflammation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Several risk factors make your body more likely to have chronic inflammation — including obesity, which promotes a low-level inflammatory state throughout the body, tobacco smoking and diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Thaddeus Stappenbeck, chair of inflammation and immunity at the Cleveland Clinic, suspects the modern American diet is a major source of chronic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Processed foods, refined sugars, trans fats and excessive consumption of red meat are associated with increased inflammation. The Food and Drug Administration banned &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-limit-trans-fats-food-n376266" target="_blank"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-limit-trans-fats-food-n376266" target="_blank"&gt;rans fats&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, and they were finally removed from snacks, bread, cookies and other baked goods in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I suspect that there’s more people with underlying, chronic inflammation than there were in the past,” Stappenbeck said.  “I think about the way we’ve shifted our diet where we eat a lot of chemicals that we are not adapted to consume, and these have a number of effects on our intestines.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Shmerling said, “Lack of exercise, lack of sleep, too much stress, all of those are lifestyle factors associated that are pro-inflammatory.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What are symptoms of inflammation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Signs may vary, but they include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Joint pain that doesn't improve. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depression. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Weight loss, regular exercise and avoiding highly processed foods can reduce levels of inflammation in the body, Shmerling said. Studies have suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/diabetes/mediterranean-diet-may-protect-diabetes-realized-science-shows-rcna81800" target="_blank"&gt;following a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, largely plant-based with an emphasis on whole fruits and vegetables, can &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/why-mediterranean-diet-best-health-benefits-rcna134812" target="_blank"&gt;reduce levels of inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s often not an on/off kind of switch,” he said. “We don’t have perfect ways to measure inflammation after making a lifestyle modification, but inflammatory markers can improve with lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How chronic inflammation affects the heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2024/23_0267.htm" target="_blank"&gt;129 million people in the United States&lt;/a&gt; have at least one chronic disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The prevalence of chronic disease &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7077778/#:~:text=In%20the%20last%2020%20years,It%20has%20become%20an%20epidemic." target="_blank"&gt;has grown by about 7 million people every five years&lt;/a&gt;, according to estimates from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The causes of chronic disease are complicated, but experts are increasingly convinced that inflammation is playing a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a fair amount of consensus that a lot of the chronic diseases we see now in higher prevalence than in the past could well be related to chronic inflammation,” Shmerling said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What comes first — the inflammation or the disease? When the body is in an inflammatory state, it can start to destroy the very things it needs to function, such as our vital organs and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Ongoing inflammation may lead to heart disease and building of plaque in the blood vessels, which can lead to heart attack and strokes," said Arditi, of Cedars-Sinai. “Long-term inflammation in your brain may lead to development of neurodegenerative diseases by damaging neurons and interfering with normal brain function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Autoimmune disorders like lupus or multiple sclerosis are also linked to chronic inflammation as the immune system starts to attack various parts of the body in friendly fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The body is not distinguishing properly between itself and an outside intruder or a pathogen,” Shmerling said. “There’s chronic inflammation that’s ongoing and quite damaging.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diseases including Parkinson’s and even diabetes all have inflammatory components to them, Stappenbeck said. Because of inflammation’s close relationship to a host of diseases, he’s not surprised by patients coming in asking to be checked for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think there’s a desire from patients to say, ‘Can you actually detect this in me earlier, before I get super sick?’” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a test for chronic inflammation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are blood tests for inflammation, but they aren’t perfect. They don't provide clear answers about where the inflammation may be lurking in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There can also be false positives. That's why experts say the tests must be interpreted along with symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One of the most common tests is called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a blood test that measures the level of certain proteins that correlate with the amount of inflammation in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another test assesses c-reactive protein (CRP), a protein the liver produces in response to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Because of the limitations, Shmerling doesn't recommend that healthy people with no symptoms be routinely screened for inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There can be normal inflammation tests even when inflammation is present, and sometimes the tests are abnormal even when it doesn’t seem there is any inflammation present,” he said. “So they’re not perfect.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Stappenbeck agreed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I don’t think there’s much of a role for it, actually,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There is some potential for a test called hs-CRP, a more sensitive test that can find smaller increases in c-reactive protein in the blood. High levels of that protein in the blood have been linked to heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some argue that this test should be done routinely, just like checking cholesterol,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to determine who is more at risk of heart attacks and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The evidence, however, has been mixed, which is why the test isn’t widely performed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“There are people who are so low-risk or so high-risk that it’s very unlikely the CRP is going to help you,” Shmerling said. “There are subsets of people, maybe at moderate risk, where a CRP for cardiac risk could be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPZWwyMVhCWEtTWENnclhYbzNabHJDZXdndUdTSmtOcnpCWklPM0FWVGlER2lsakRrdXVIdUpsam1YdjYtd2JGSGJZZGpwWE41akFrYjJNdzVGbzlsZG1pX1F2Yjc1c3RGVnF5RkZsMjRkZkRkeXdvTEFwUktHZ3VyaDRCN1VpeWZOQUhSN2twa2ZZdDA4ajZ3M2tEb0pIdzhZN1FqSUxiNkNnUkFh0gFWQVVfeXFMT3czaVdrUWxPRTJOWGRsYjk2UUkwb3pRYmdTVGNnc0wtd2MxeTV4bEZqN1FBejRtR2ExbThOM2g3Qzc3RHRBZFAzOEFhN1BnR1N3YWFMZmc</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Sound the Alarm Over Plastics in Our Brains After Shocking Study - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQMVdWN1FOYURjcVR6RkxzQk5kd1pQeTFlYjZ5NXdMRjVhMjR4X1RINUlwUU56S2VDMXpkb3ptdFIxU3lRTkNXdjRCT0QxbHBIWkhMUzRybUVsSDBjbnMzLUNWV1V2SDJzZ0RtR21HSUdkZm5ONjg0TElnNnM0OVVudVUxcU1SdE03QW95X3ZUazRSd3BtODdIQmxkUGdpZTZfMVFDSy1jd0Jqdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;If the thought of having a spoonful of plastic in your noggin sounds bad to you, you’re not the only one. Scientists are sounding the alarm over a recent study showing that microplastics can accumulate in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the U.S. and Canada wrote the commentary, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.61373/bm025c.0020"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the journal Brain Medicine. In addition to discussing the recent brain study, they detail the overall science suggesting that microplastics are harming the environment and our health. While more research is needed to figure out the best ways to clear these substances from our bodies, people can already take steps to minimize their exposure, the scientists claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microplastics are any piece of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters. In recent years, scientists have found them &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-in-blood-air-water-everywhere-1851492637"&gt;just about anywhere&lt;/a&gt; they’ve looked—from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-could-be-affecting-the-weather-too-1851021523"&gt;mountaintop clouds&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-testicles-humans-dogs-sperm-count-1851488727"&gt;our testicles&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-are-showing-up-in-baby-poop-1847734053"&gt;baby’s poop&lt;/a&gt;. But a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in Nature Medicine from researchers at the University of New Mexico sent off a new wave of concern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The UNM researchers not only found microplastics in deceased people’s brains, they found higher concentrations of plastic in people’s livers, kidneys, or other organs. What’s more, this accumulation seemed to be much greater in recently deceased people, suggesting that plastic exposure has only worsened as of late. They also found a higher concentration of plastics in the brains of people with dementia—perhaps signaling a connection to the fatal neurological condition. The UNM researchers estimated that people’s brains today could be carrying an entire plastic spoon’s worth of these tiny fragments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nicholas Fabiano, lead author of the new commentary, published today, cautions that there’s still a lot we don’t know about the health impacts of microplastics. But what we’ve learned so far isn’t exactly encouraging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hearing that there is a spoon’s worth of microplastics in the brain was shocking. As a psychiatry resident, this is particularly relevant, since we currently do not know the full extent this may impact one’s cognition or mental health,” Fabiano, a researcher at the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry, told Gizmodo. “In the Nature Medicine study, microplastic levels were 3-5 times higher in the brains of those with dementia, which raises alarms, however these findings are not causal in nature.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not just the plastics themselves that could be dangerous to our bodies, but the chemicals that seep out of them. Scientists have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/chemicals-in-plastics-are-a-global-health-threat-says-1845886426"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; over a hundred chemicals in plastic that might harm us or other animals, particularly chemicals that can mimic and then possibly disrupt the regulation of important hormones. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals have &lt;a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/increase-in-cancers-and-fertility#:~:text=Chemicals%20which%20disrupt%20the%20hormone,European%20Environment%20Agency%20(EEA)."&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to greater rates of infertility, certain cancers, and metabolic disorders like diabetes, to name a few. And there are likely other ways that plastics or their chemicals could be affecting our health for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The current evidence base (largely based upon animal and cell culture studies) suggests that [microplastic] exposure can lead to adverse health impacts via oxidative stress, inflammation, immune dysfunction, altered biochemical/energy metabolism, impaired cell proliferation, abnormal organ development, disrupted metabolic pathways, and carcinogenicity,” the authors of the Brain Medicine commentary wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many unanswered questions about microplastics remain, Fabiano notes. In addition to the unknown long-term health risks, we’re not even sure how these plastics are entering the brain, for instance. There’s also still little we know about how our bodies might flush microplastics away, though some research has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3255175/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that we can literally sweat out certain plastic-associated chemicals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these unknowns, Fabiano (and &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/plastics-edcs-and-health"&gt;many other scientists&lt;/a&gt;) have called for governments and policymakers to take action and start reducing our collective exposure to microplastics. In the meantime, people can also do things in their personal lives to limit their intake of plastics. These include: switching from regularly drinking bottled water to filtered tap water; eating fewer foods commonly made with plastic, like certain tea bags (that said, some kinds of tea bags are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/your-daily-tea-routine-is-protecting-you-from-heavy-metals-study-finds-2000568636#:~:text=Tea%20bags%20play,than%20synthetic%20materials."&gt;better than others&lt;/a&gt;), or foods that are known to contain high levels of microplastics, such as seafood, alcohol, and highly processed foods in general; and storing our leftovers in glass or stainless steel containers rather than plastic ones.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating blueberries as part of a balanced diet has been associated with multiple health benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anthocyanins are an antioxidant found abundantly in blueberries. These plant compounds give blueberries and other produce, like blackberries and purple cauliflower, their deep blue and purple hue. However, they offer more benefits than color alone. “Anthocyanins have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the body, which may positively impact both vascular and cognitive function,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionbymandy.com/about-mandy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mandy Tyler, M. Ed., RD, CSSD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Research has found that anthocyanins may help reduce the risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More specifically, some studies have shown that eating blueberries might help reduce inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP). Reducing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is essential for chronic disease prevention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Optimal intake of dietary fiber has many known &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, such as helping improve gut health, reduce LDL (known as “bad”) cholesterol and stabilize blood sugar. Additionally, eating fiber may aid in long-term &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15696/is-fiber-good-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt; since it helps you feel satisfied.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Blueberries are a good source of fiber and can help you reach your daily fiber goals. “A 1-cup serving of fresh blueberries contains approximately 4 grams of dietary fiber,” says Tyler.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is approximately between  12 to 18% of the daily recommended intake of 22 to 34 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Higher intakes of anthocyanins, the antioxidant found in abundance in blueberries, have been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that people with greater anthocyanin intake may have a reduced risk of heart attack and high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Eating blueberries may also help improve your vascular function, supporting your overall heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s an uncontrollable decline in your cognitive health as you age, diet can keep your brain functioning at its prime. And eating blueberries has been shown to support cognitive health. One study found that a group of older adults (65-80 years old) improved their cognitive function after eating freeze-dried blueberry powder for six months.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A smaller study conducted in a younger group aged 40-65 found that those who ate one cup of wild blueberries with breakfast experienced improvements in cognitive function, particularly in episodic memory and executive function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your immune system does more than ward off a common cold or the flu. It also protects you from more serious invaders that can cause severe damage to your body. Blueberries contain a significant amount of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, one key nutrient that helps support your immune health. A 1-cup serving has 12mg of vitamin C—equivalent to 13% of the recommended daily intake of 90 mg for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The anthocyanins in blueberries may also play a role in immune health through various mechanisms, including fighting inflammation and reducing oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries are a nutrient-dense fruit with a notable amount of fiber, vitamin C, potassium and vitamin K. They’re also naturally low in saturated fat and contain polyphenols—plant compounds known to fight chronic disease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries are one of the most nutrient-dense fruits, but they can come with risks for certain people. Many plants contain salicylates, including blueberries. “Salicylates are a natural plant chemical that protects a fruit, vegetable or other plant from germs and disease development,” says Gaw. Some people may have an allergy to salicylates, so avoiding them is best since food allergies can lead to anaphylaxis—a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. Salicylates may also have negative interactions with some drugs, so it’s best to review your current medications with a doctor to determine if salicylates are safe for you to eat.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, some people may have an allergy or sensitivity to blueberries per se. “If eating blueberries causes an allergic reaction such as swelling, stomach pain, difficulty breathing, numbness, or itching, you should avoid them,” says Gaw.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding more blueberries to your diet will help you reap their many health benefits. “Blueberries are incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed in many ways,” says&lt;a href="https://thetoddlerkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Ali Ellis, M.Sc., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Some of my favorite recommendations for enjoying blueberries include sprinkling them on top of a bowl of oatmeal or granola, adding them into muffins, or pairing them with some walnuts and dark chocolate for a delicious afternoon snack.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy as a Snack:&lt;/strong&gt; Simply washing a batch of fresh blueberries and enjoying it straight from a bowl is a refreshing and simple way to up your blueberry intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to baked goods: &lt;/strong&gt;Blueberries make a delicious addition to baked goods, including muffins, quick breads and oatmeal bakes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use in smoothies: &lt;/strong&gt;Add frozen or fresh blueberries to your next fruit smoothie for increased fiber and flavor. “Frozen blueberries are picked at peak ripeness, which maximizes their anthocyanin concentration, and then they are flash frozen, preserving their nutritional value,” says Ellis. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top your breakfast cereal or oatmeal: &lt;/strong&gt;Fresh blueberries are a great addition to breakfast cereal and oatmeal. You can add frozen blueberries to oatmeal before cooking for a robust berry flavor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try dried or freeze-dried: &lt;/strong&gt;Eating dried or freeze-dried blueberries is another fun way to enjoy them. Dried blueberries can be added to trail mix, while freeze-dried blueberries are great as a standalone snack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle over a salad: &lt;/strong&gt;Salads are a great and easy way to up your veggie and fruit servings. And blueberries add a sweet yet tangy flavor profile. The best part of including them in your salads is that you simply wash and toss them with the rest of the ingredients—no chopping required!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries are a tiny yet mighty fruit packed with nutrients to support your health, including antioxidants, fiber and vitamins. They may help reduce inflammation, prevent chronic diseases and improve your gut and heart health, to name a few. However, if you have an allergy or sensitivity to salicylates, you may want to avoid them.

&lt;p&gt;The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans generally recommends around 2 cups of fruit daily.&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; However, that amount may vary depending on your age, sex and calorie intake. One cup of blueberries is considered one serving.&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blueberries alone will not contribute to a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-target-losing-visceral-fat-8760072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduction in body fat&lt;/a&gt; unless eaten as part of a diet specifically designed to enable weight loss. However, because blueberries are naturally low in calories and are high in fiber, they are a good choice when following an eating pattern to support weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

In her case, it also involved taking samples of tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Maria Waters had a hysteroscopy after experiencing unusual vaginal bleeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Right from the start, it was extremely painful, like I was being cut,’ says Maria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The toughest part was all the poking around as the hysteroscopist kept removing the scope and reinserting it – four times in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I really struggled but I thought it would only last a few minutes longer and maybe I could bear it. Then I felt faint and nauseous.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the scope was inserted for a fourth time, she lost consciousness and came to with her legs being held up by staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I had collapsed due to shock – the ten-minute procedure lasted 35 minutes as the team had to wait for my blood pressure to return to normal. I had to spend about an hour in recovery before I was stable enough to leave.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the following days Maria says she bled ‘quite heavily’, and experienced abdominal cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS does hundreds of thousands of hysteroscopies a year – it is the most common gynaecological procedure carried out in outpatient departments, with 263,572 performed in England alone, according to the latest figures. Most (68 per cent) were done in outpatients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The procedure is performed for many reasons – for example, to investigate infertility or abnormal bleeding, and to examine fibroids (benign growths in or around the womb) or polyps (growths of the inner lining of the uterus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A hysteroscopy is an examination of the inside of the uterus (womb) using a narrow telescope containing a camera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hysteroscopies are also often combined with on-the-spot treatments, such as removal of polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Demand is growing steadily, mainly due to the rise in the proportion of older, post-menopausal women being investigated for abnormal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other factors include rising rates of obesity (obesity is linked to endometrial cancer) and high numbers of women on HRT reporting abnormal bleeding (possibly due to oestrogen stimulating the lining of the uterus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years ago, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) published guidelines on outpatient hysteroscopy management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It said while most women tolerated the procedure, it could cause severe pain and even be traumatic – a third of women rated the pain as 7+ (on a pain scale out of ten), and this was something women should be told before having the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, the RCOG said hysteroscopists must stop the procedure at either the woman’s request or that of staff, if they considered she was in too much pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as encouraging women to take simple analgesia beforehand (ibuprofen and/or paracetamol) the guidance set out further options for pain control, such as a local anaesthesia injection into the cervix at the beginning of the procedure or inhaled sedation/analgesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if the procedure had to be stopped, it should be rescheduled, and the next time the woman should be offered intravenous sedation, an epidural or spinal anaesthesia or a general anaesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kathleen Ryan, 63, a retired nurse from Hall Green, Birmingham, opted to have a hysterectomy to avoid having hysteroscopies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet campaigners say too often these guidelines are being ignored, leaving women needlessly in excruciating pain during what should be a straightforward procedure. As a result, some are even saying they will no longer have these important investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Campaign Against Painful Hysteroscopy has collected data from thousands of women across the UK – and, as Good Health can reveal, the ongoing survey of almost 8,000 women shows the vast majority (83 per cent) were not told beforehand about the risk of severe pain and, alarmingly, 67 per cent said hysteroscopists didn’t immediately stop when they said they were in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the women (60 per cent) also said they continued with the procedure even though they were in pain, because they didn’t know there was an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health floatRHS" data-version="2" id="mol-14ef4e60-f859-11ef-806d-61f62d901730" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14456067/women-warned-barbaric-procedure-leaves-traumatised-agony-no-longer-wanting-sex.html"&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;'WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SCREAMING, YOU START TO WORRY'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Until you’ve had a hysteroscopy, you do not know what pain is,’ says Kathleen Ryan, 63, a retired nurse from Birmingham. ‘It’s like somebody’s ripping your insides out. It’s torture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I’ve got a high pain threshold – I breezed my way through spiral fracture to my ankle, and it was a really bad break. I didn’t need any painkillers in the ambulance or after the operation.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she later had a hysterectomy, even then she didn’t need strong painkillers – ‘It is standard to take strong analgesia, but I just had a couple of paracetamol pills for a few days.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kathleen says she will never forget her first hysteroscopy in 2019 for post-menopausal bleeding, at Birmingham Women’s Hospital, where she had worked as a pain nurse until her recent retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s amazing to think now that I went along to the clinic never imagining what they would do,’ she says. ‘It’s only when you’re sat waiting when you can hear people screaming, that you start to worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I assumed there would be some sort of pain relief but there was absolutely none. I hadn’t been told to take any before either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There were two nurses either side of me who tried to distract me. When I gasped and said it was very painful, they said it’ll only last a minute or so. They made me feel like I was the only one who had found it painful; I thought I must be a real wuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When the gynaecologist removed the instruments, I felt like I was going to pass out. Then I sat up and saw the bucket under my legs full of blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I staggered to the day room, was given a cup of tea and a ginger biscuit, and then told I was ready to go. I was in such a state of shock, I was in the car park for an hour before I could even drive.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kathleen’s biopsies showed she had a pre-cancerous condition called complex atypical hyperplasia, and so would need regular hysteroscopies to monitor it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At her next appointment three months later, she says she pleaded for pain relief. ‘I was in agony and said: “You’ve got to stop!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was then given gas and air but it really didn’t help. As I was leaving, one of the nurses took my hand, and said: “Next time have a couple of gins before you come. It’ll help you relax.” I was stunned.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After that, the thought of having another procedure made Kathleen ‘a nervous wreck’. She was meant to have the procedures every three months but they were so horrendous she negotiated for them to be twice yearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘During one it was so painful, I flinched and said: “You have got to stop.” And the nurses got their elbows on my knee and pinned me down. It sounds medieval and it absolutely is.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On another occasion she took codeine and diazepam beforehand, as prescribed by her GP, but this made little difference. So the next time she requested a general anaesthetic but was told neither this nor sedation was possible as an outpatient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘With my next appointment looming in November 2021, I decided I wasn’t going back. I told a friend I didn’t care if I died – it seemed a better option.’ She saw a consultant privately and the following year had a full hysterectomy on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I thank God every day that I don’t need more hysteroscopies. But I can’t understand how in this day and age, something so brutalising is allowed. I would go as far as to say it’s a violent assault.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jocelyn Lewis, co-founder of the campaign, says most women (80 per cent) were unaware that they could even have a general anaesthetic or sedation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We simply want hysteroscopy without the pain,’ she says. ‘It is the only invasive procedure where women are guided – that’s the polite way of phrasing it – into outpatients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Despite what the guidance says, generally speaking, women are told that general anaesthetic and sedation aren’t available, and if they insist on wanting it they’ll have a long wait.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because it would involve them being admitted to a ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Most of these women, or a significant proportion, are having a hysteroscopy because they’ve got abnormal post-menopausal bleeding, so often they’re on the two-week cancer pathway as well,’ adds Jocelyn. ‘So they are faced with either the outpatient route, where they may suffer, or have a long wait. This is no choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So many women say the pain is worse than childbirth – some have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hysteroscopy also affects their personal relationships – some are just so traumatised by it, they no longer want to have sex.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Worryingly, most of the women say they will opt out of any future gynaecological checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Women refuse smear tests because they’ve gone for a hysteroscopy, and they are so unprepared for it being so painful that they lose trust in the gynaecological service,’ says Jocelyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So we risk the NHS not picking up gynaecological cancers.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alix Marijan, 53, an operations manager from Hanwell, West London, underwent a hysteroscopy last summer and found it so traumatic that she now says she would never repeat it without a general anaesthetic or at the very least sedation. The mother-of-three was referred for the procedure after unusual vaginal bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have never experienced pain like it,’ recalls Alix. ‘For the first five minutes, I gritted my teeth. But when it came to taking the biopsies, I began to feel sweaty and nauseous – the doctor kept removing the tube and reinserting it, about four times, and I remember the room spinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was told I could take paracetamol before if I wished, but I’ve always been fine with smear tests and I have quite a high pain threshold, so I didn’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But I was arching my back with the pain – the nurse and an assistant held me in a position, but it felt like being pinned down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Surely, if a patient is in a great deal of pain, you should stop? The whole thing lasted about ten minutes, but it felt like longer. By the end of it, I was barely conscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When my partner Steve came to collect me, I was bent over double with horrendous cramping, and cold and shivering, with a headache. He was horrified and asked what had happened. We made it back home before I vomited.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other women who’ve undergone a hysteroscopy, Alix assumed she was at fault for being unable to tolerate the pain, as she was led to believe most women get through the procedure without a fuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I now tell anyone I meet who needs a hysteroscopy not to be gaslighted into believing that you are just making a fuss by requesting pain relief,’ says Alix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I truly believe that if the procedure involved a tube and camera going up a man’s penis, a general anaesthetic would be standard.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Months on, she still feels traumatised by the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I would describe the procedure as barbaric and there was a complete failure to warn me about what was about to happen.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; The Campaign Against Painful Hysteroscopy’s objective is not to scare women off from having the procedure – because it’s important, says Jocelyn – ‘We want all women to be offered a real choice’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These horror stories – and I don’t think there’s an alternative way of describing them – are true and they have to be believed, but it is important to recognise they are not the majority,’ says Mary Connor, a gynaecologist from Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The practice wouldn’t have continued for 30 years if it was unacceptable for most women.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has trained thousands of doctors to perform the procedure and points to an audit in 2019 of more than 5,000 British women that found pain ‘for the majority was manageable’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But I suppose the thing that we forget is how vulnerable and disempowered people may feel when they are undergoing procedures. That’s why it’s so important with hysteroscopies to have a patient advocate, whose main job is to alert the hysteroscopist if the patient is in severe pain or distress and can’t, or is unable to, speak up.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last September, reports of women’s experiences prompted the RCOG to update its clinical guidance again. For instance, the advice includes using the narrowest possible hysteroscope and the lowest possible pressure of the fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It is disturbing to hear about some women’s negative experiences,’ says gynaecologist Geeta Kumar, vice president for clinical quality at the RCOG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If a procedure is traumatic, it can impact a woman’s life for ever. But the procedure is vital for many patients in order to diagnose and treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That is why the RCOG encourages all those carrying out hysteroscopies to read and follow our guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If we stopped doing outpatient hysteroscopies, it would be a massive disadvantage, not just because general anaesthesia carries additional risks, but because it takes away the choice of setting for many women and can lead to potential delay due to the current length of waiting lists for women waiting for procedures to be done in theatre. Right now, the NHS just doesn’t have the resources to increase that capacity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A consultant gynaecologist at the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in north Wales, Dr Kumar has been carrying out hysteroscopies for 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The difficult thing is you can’t predict who will experience the most pain,’ she says. ‘There are certain features that can potentially predict a more painful procedure – if somebody gets very severe period pain or finds smears or speculum examinations painful, then those can be predictors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But it doesn’t always mean that they will not tolerate outpatient hysteroscopy – and it’s important to pre-warn all women and make sure that you discuss the options for pain relief beforehand.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maria Waters agrees that choice is key – and with the vantage point of a patient, she says: ‘I always used to tell women that the procedure may be painful, but is usually well-tolerated. I now add that it can be extremely painful for some, especially those who have not delivered a child vaginally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’m also extra careful to advise them to consider all their options and pain management ahead of their appointments as, during the consultation, there will be little time to discuss and weigh up options and alternatives.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An NHS spokesperson said: ‘While patients may feel some discomfort during intimate procedures like hysteroscopies, no one should have to experience pain, and all NHS trusts should be following the latest clinical guidance from the RCOG to deliver the best clinical and psychological care for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Different pain relief options should be discussed with a clinician before any procedure as part of NHS England’s standardised consent forms for hysteroscopy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 01:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxQQ2pfYkF4MGV3Vk05RWVrSDRuTDVzbURybmhrNG01UXhhZlo2T0xPb0Zfd2ZZV0hTTzlCSlQ4bzd5QloxNF9SdDF2d2VPVmJSZHc0dzJ5NDI3U3JOU1k4Z3BIWmNXcmFPdU5YQ0hpR2lGRUlSYUJRWFlhbWlDQzY2S2hRU3pYZUloTTBEMnVzcl9NMzR6SjJVSGtuOVQ4eGFTWFFVMk9GLXktQXo2S2tWTzJ6TGFObjNnU1FzdDRXWm5GMW1UVGhIOHlJdHNoTjlY</guid></item><item><title>More than 50% of adults predicted to be obese by 2050 worldwide - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE50a3NxX3ZIV0pIUmdrRXpTbkN4SkJydnViRExOalNFNmo2V215d2hGQnM4NlBhTFlBa09UVUE2djFOOVVuY2tRT2w1ejBCSzlXV01obDljczV2d9IBX0FVX3lxTE1fOVROcXhNYWtxZnJfS25RZFRPaXV3S3NXbXZkVHZ6RVBvRVVBTkN5aFl5SC1mdXd0TmxLNS0xM2NMX3JJbmRqcTRsYTQ1amtLT1ZsTkgyY2lVdmN0cTlz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;More than half of all adults and a third of children, teenagers and young adults around the world are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The findings come in a new study of global data published in &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00355-1/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; journal, covering more than 200 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Researchers warn that obesity levels are predicted to accelerate rapidly during the remainder of this decade, particularly in lower-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, experts say that if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what they describe as a "profound tragedy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;By 2021, almost half the global adult population  - a billion men and 1.11 billion women aged 25 or older - were overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The proportion of both men and women living with these conditions has doubled since 1990. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If trends continue, global rates of overweight and obese adults would rise to about 57.4% for men and 60.3% for women by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In terms of raw numbers, China (627 million), India (450 million) and the USA (214 million) will be the countries with the biggest populations of overweight or obese people in 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, population growth means that forecasters are predicting the number in sub-Saharan Africa will rise by more than 250% to 522 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Nigeria, in particular, stands out, with the predicted number projected to more than triple - from 36.6 million in 2021 to 141 million in 2050. That would make it the country with the fourth-largest population of adults who are overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The authors acknowledge the study does not take into account the impact that new weight loss medications might have - and they could play a significant role in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Experts say if governments take urgent action now, there is still time to prevent what could be a disaster for vulnerable healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The research was led by Prof Emmanuela Gakidou, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), at the University of Washington in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said: "[Governments] can use our country specific estimates on the stage, timing, and speed of current and forecasted transitions in weight to identify priority populations experiencing the greatest burdens of obesity who require immediate intervention and treatment, and those that remain predominantly overweight and should be primarily targeted with prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The unprecedented global epidemic of overweight and obesity is a profound tragedy and a monumental societal failure," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A surge in rates of obesity is happening right now, particularly among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Rates of obesity in children and younger teenagers (from 8.8% to 18.1%) and younger adults (those under 25 - from 9.9% to 20.3%) more than doubled between 1990 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, by 2050 one in three young people will be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The co-lead author of the report, Dr Jessica Kerr of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Australia, says the figures present a real challenge to health care systems in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But if we act now, preventing a complete transition to global obesity for children and adolescents is still possible," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Our estimates identify children and adolescents in much of Europe and south Asia living with overweight who should be targeted with obesity prevention strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We have also identified large populations, particularly adolescent girls, in North America, Australasia, Oceania, North Africa and the Middle East, and Latin America that are expected to tip over to obesity predominance and require urgent, multifaceted intervention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This is essential to avoid intergenerational transmission of obesity and to prevent a wave of serious health conditions and dire financial and societal costs for future generations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 01:25:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE50a3NxX3ZIV0pIUmdrRXpTbkN4SkJydnViRExOalNFNmo2V215d2hGQnM4NlBhTFlBa09UVUE2djFOOVVuY2tRT2w1ejBCSzlXV01obDljczV2d9IBX0FVX3lxTE1fOVROcXhNYWtxZnJfS25RZFRPaXV3S3NXbXZkVHZ6RVBvRVVBTkN5aFl5SC1mdXd0TmxLNS0xM2NMX3JJbmRqcTRsYTQ1amtLT1ZsTkgyY2lVdmN0cTlz</guid></item><item><title>As RFK Jr. delivers his message on measles, public health experts hear a familiar tune - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOZjJpSmpBOC1DaWhIZVFfb2kyajJvNTc5Y1ctZHRtVU8yN242YmVtT2t2bGlPTEd2UVRuVXpVb0FrYnNYX2F0WHJHc1BuLTNqbXg5aTZUbnJ2bF94dzdIc0tWYjkwNzMwUTZoMGxNdkRCTXBFSzV6eEZOTHoxaDhOWkhnNFNCZklxdkFSY1h5aWdlczR6Z1Q1SjcxM1RsY1hYZWFzZW5XVl8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headlines on Robert Kennedy Jr.’s &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles commentary&lt;/a&gt; published on Sunday excited proponents of vaccines who have worried about the Health and Human Services Secretary’s oft-aired skepticism about the value and safety of vaccines.  With a growing outbreak of measles in Texas, they’d been watching HHS and its new leader, waiting for the call to vaccinate children that the headlines implied the article would contain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as they read through the commentary looking for a full-throated appeal for parents of unvaccinated children to get their children immunized — the standard public health approach in a measles outbreak — what they saw instead was coded text from a different playbook, one written by opponents of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The stressing of parental choice. A recommendation that parents talk to a health care provider about the possibility of vaccination. An emphatic push for good nutrition and vitamin supplementation, factors that influence measles survival in developing countries if children are malnourished, but are no shield against infection anywhere, and not the threat facing children in Texas, New Mexico, and other states with active outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an outbreak that has &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/26/texas-measles-outbreak-death/"&gt;already claimed one life&lt;/a&gt;, that wasn’t the message that a number of public health officials STAT spoke to Monday were hoping to read. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You would expect the conversation to be saying: This is why vaccination is absolutely imperative, and [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and HHS wholeheartedly recommend individuals who are not vaccinated receive the vaccine. And we just don’t get that here,” said Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“‘Ask your doctor, understand your options.’ That’s a huge departure from the classic response to a measles outbreak for decades,” Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak, which has already led to nearly 150 cases and at least 18 hospitalizations, has placed Kennedy in a situation where his statements or lack thereof are being viewed through the frame of his well-known distrust of the safety of vaccines — particularly the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been falsely linked to autism. (Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/30/rfk-jr-vaccines-autism-confirmation-hearing/"&gt;repeatedly refused to denounce that disproved allegation&lt;/a&gt; during his Senate confirmation process.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the commentary, which was published on the Fox News website, read like a traditional pro-public health argument was about to unspool, with Kennedy expressing concern about the outbreak, revealing he had offered condolences to the family of the child who had died, and reminding readers that people who are vaccinated against measles help to protect those who cannot be vaccinated and are therefore vulnerable to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It started strong,” said Paul Offit, an infectious diseases expert at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who has long been a leading voice for vaccination in this country. “Then it sort of fell apart.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Several of the people STAT interviewed for this article suggested the commentary seemed a bit disjointed, as if it had been written by multiple people. Schwartz likened it a bit to a “Frankenstein” creation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There were clearly a lot of hands and voices in this text,” he said. “Several minds being expressed here in this piece.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if the headlines on the commentary would have been suggested by HHS, or if they were written by the editorial staff of Fox News. It would not be unusual for a senior government official to have advisers help craft a missive like this one. But, in this case, William Moss, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said part of what was interesting was “how the messages are mixed here.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t blatant vaccine skepticism expressed in this piece. It was more subtle,” said Moss, who is also executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heidi Larson, who has long worked in the field of vaccine confidence, said she was glad to see some of what Kennedy wrote in the article, particularly his comment about having called the grieving parents of the child who died. When first asked about the death last week, Kennedy offered no sympathies and appeared to try to downplay the severity of the Texas outbreak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Maybe it’s because my bar has dropped … so low in the past couple of weeks that I’m happy to see any quasi-positive thing,” said Larson, a professor of anthropology, risk, and decision science in the department of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine. She acknowledged, though, that Kennedy went off track at points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malia Jones, an assistant professor of community health in the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s department of community and environmental sociology, argued that the actual messaging in the commentary fell short of what the moment demands from the country’s leading health official. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I guess it’s more of an endorsement [of vaccines] than we’ve seen from RFK Jr. in the past, but it still is not him saying measles vaccines are safe, effective, and necessary,” Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The op-ed did address the need to make vaccines available to people who want them. But as much or more emphasis in it was placed on nutrition. The article called it “a best defence” against many chronic and infectious diseases, listing off a string of vitamins that should be part of a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;No public health expert will argue against the benefits of a balanced diet. But the stress on diet as an answer to a measles outbreak in a highly developed country where malnutrition is not common seemed to miss the point, several suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He does seem to subscribe to the idea that is certainly one of the anti-vax movement talking points that public health prevention amounts to taking a multivitamin, or eating whole foods,” Jones argued. “We can have good nutrition … and also vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, Kennedy focused on vitamin A, which is recommended as part of the supportive care regimen for children who are hospitalized with measles. Studies have shown vitamin A improves the chances of survival, especially in children whose stores of vitamin A have been depleted by malnutrition. But Offit and others have questioned whether vitamin A has the same benefit in children who are not malnourished. And in any case, it cannot prevent infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Giving kids who are hospitalized vitamin A really doesn’t meet the bar for me for public health prevention,” Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A healthy immune system could certainly help a child weather the measles. But if the goal is to prevent measles infections — which it should be — that’s not enough, Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can have the best immune response in the world, but you’re not going to have specific immunity unless you’ve either been naturally infected or vaccinated,” he said. “Those are your only two options for specific immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Multnomah County is seeing a large spike in winter season Shigella infections for the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/bacterial-illness-shigella-portland-metro-area/283-85c54edc-874a-4cb7-a7b3-cf5a2a1c7816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;second year in a row&lt;/a&gt;, with more cases recorded in January than in any prior month since 2012, according to data from the county health department.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shigella is a type of bacteria that can can cause severe diarrhea, fever and fatigue in humans, a condition historically known as dysentery. It is typically transmitted when fecal bacteria from an infected person gets into another person's mouth, according to county health officials. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last big wave of infections in Multnomah County saw 72 recorded cases from November 2023 to January 2024, excluding cases where the person likely caught the illness while traveling internationally. The total for the same time period this time around is 105, with 40 cases in January alone.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shigella cases have been rising in Multnomah County since 2012, and in recent years the county has also seen the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. Sanitation access plays a role in transmission, so the spikes have disproportionately impacted the homeless community; last year's outbreak was concentrated in &lt;a href="/article/news/local/homeless/contagious-illness-spreads-old-town-hospital/283-c5856d2a-c962-4270-b5b9-4d111abe9697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria can sometimes spread through single-source outbreaks such as contaminated food at a restaurant, but it's more common for it to spread directly from one person to another, either through direct contact like sexual intercourse or indirect contact such as touching one's mouth after touching a contaminated surface.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections can range from mild to fatal, but the more severe cases are typically caused by a specific strain of the bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Shigella dysenteriae, &lt;/em&gt;which is usually only found in countries or regions with poor sanitation infrastructure.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The two strains commonly found in Oregon are &lt;em&gt;Shigella flexneri&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shigella sonnei, &lt;/em&gt;which tend to cause milder illness. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people can expect the symptoms to resolve without treatment in about 5-7 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but antibiotics may be necessary in more severe cases or for people who are immunocompromised. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of cases in Multnomah County are contracted locally rather than through international travel, according to the county. Among those cases, looking at the time period from 2017 through January, 2025, about 91% were person-to-person rather than originating at specific points like restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 78% of cases were male, with a median age of 42 years. About 46% of cases involved gay or bisexual men, 44% were people experiencing homelessness, and about a third were people who use drugs. The county said its health department prioritizes short-term housing for people who test positive, because of the importance of access to sanitation in preventing transmission of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People infected with Shigella can help limit the spread by staying home from school or work, washing their hands often, not preparing food for others, avoiding sharing drug paraphernalia, avoiding sexual activity and refraining from recreational water activities. Those restrictions should be followed until at least two weeks after the diarrhea stops.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue light often gets a bad rap, probably because most of what we know about it is that it wreaks havoc on our &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/these-sleep-habits-can-kill-you-faster-7-tips-for-better-zs/"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But new research suggests that exposure to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/27/lifestyle/blue-light-therapy-has-soared-as-a-popular-blemish-treatment-doctors-weigh-in-on-whether-it-really-works/"&gt;blue light&lt;/a&gt; can actually help older folks snooze better. The catch? Timing is everything. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-025-01506-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal GeroScience found that exposing &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/health/this-healthy-trifecta-might-be-the-secret-to-living-longer/"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; to blue light during the day can help them fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly at night. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers found that older adults who were exposed to blue light for a couple of hours in the morning slept better. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers tested different lighting conditions on participants 50 to 81 years old for 11 weeks, analyzing their sleep quality and brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those exposed to higher levels of blue light during the day showed noticeable improvements in how quickly they dozed off and how long they spent in a state of deep, restorative rest. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Adult sleep patterns naturally change with age, often resulting in less deep sleep and more frequent nighttime awakenings. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The benefits were only applicable when participants were exposed to blue light for a couple of hours in the morning — whereas blue light exposure in the evening led to more restlessness in bed and poor overall &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/sleep-expert-reveals-the-5-foods-and-drinks-keeping-you-up-all-night/#!"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adult &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/just-1-sleepless-night-is-as-bad-for-your-immune-system-as-obesity-study/"&gt;sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt; naturally change with age, often resulting in less deep sleep and more frequent nighttime awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As we get older, our circadian rhythm shifts in what’s called a ‘phase advance,’ meaning we naturally feel sleepy earlier,” &lt;a href="https://optimalcircadianhealth.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Dylan Petkus&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep specialist and founder of Optimal Circadian Health in Florida, previously &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/health/ideal-bedtime-sweet-spot-for-optimal-health-revealed-doc/"&gt;told The Post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just preference, your body’s clock is changing.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the most frustrating aspects of age-related sleep changes are due to reduced mobility, which means getting &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/03/health/3-tips-to-ease-into-daylight-saving-time-so-you-dont-ruin-your-sleep/"&gt;less sunlight&lt;/a&gt; — a crucial component of good sleep — as well as spending more time in front of artificial light at night. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Blue light, especially from digital devices, boosts your alertness and suppresses the production of melatonin.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Those are habits that you can control — and this study indicates that getting most of your blue light activity out of the way in the morning, soaking up some sunlight during the day and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/30/health/screentime-before-bed-could-be-less-harmful-than-earlier-thought/"&gt;staying away from screens&lt;/a&gt; at night might be the key to success. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that carefully timed light intervention can be a powerful tool for improving sleep and day-to-day activity in healthy older adults,” said study co-author &lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/daan-van-der-veen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Daan van der Veen&lt;/a&gt;, a senior lecturer in sleep and chronobiology at the University of Surrey in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By focusing on morning blue light and maximizing daytime light exposure, we can help older adults achieve more restful sleep and maintain a healthier, more active lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research offers a relatively easy and non-pharmaceutical approach for ensuring older people get a good night’s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We believe that this is one of the first studies that have looked into the effects of self-administered light therapy on healthy older adults living independently, to help aid their sleep and daily activity,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/debora-constantino" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Débora Constantino&lt;/a&gt;, a postgraduate research student.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It highlights the potential for accessible and affordable light-based therapies to address age-related sleep issues without the need for medication.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blue light can improve alertness, help with memory and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/06/health/switching-to-this-diet-can-improve-memory-and-reduce-dementia-risk/"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; and boost mood. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it can also suppress the production of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/04/health/dont-take-melatonin-supplements-for-insomnia-sleep-doctors/"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; — a hormone that helps you fall asleep. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As such, Fernanda Fanek, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at &lt;a href="https://valleystream.northwell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Long Island Jewish Valley Stream Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, recommends not only avoiding screens at night but keeping your phone well out of arm’s reach. &lt;br&gt;“This limits exposure to blue light,” she previously &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/health/sleep-specialist-reveals-4-tips-for-better-winter-slumber/"&gt;told The Post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Having the phone far away will require you to get up out of bed to turn off the alarm and less likely to get back into it and snooze it a few times, which will help you stick to your wake-up schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;

(KATU) — &lt;/span&gt;U.S. Senators Patty Murray, Tammy Baldwin, and Angela Alsobrooks expressed grave concerns over the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) decision to &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/114399" target="_blank" title="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/114399" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;cancel &lt;/a&gt;a critical meeting amid the worst flu season in 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting, originally scheduled for March 13, was intended to discuss and recommend influenza strains for the upcoming flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter sent on Friday to Dr. Marty Makary, President Trump's nominee for FDA Commissioner, the senators criticized the cancellation, pushing the importance of the annual meeting. "The cancellation of next week’s VRBPAC meeting is unprecedented," they wrote. "This Committee has met every year for the past 30 years to discuss the influenza virus vaccines for the upcoming flu season and make recommendations to the FDA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine efficacy for the 2024-2025 flu season was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;up to 78%&lt;/a&gt; against influenza-associated hospitalization. According to &lt;a href="https://www.flu.com/Articles/2024/2024-2025-Flu-Vaccine-Effectiveness" target="_blank" title="https://www.flu.com/Articles/2024/2024-2025-Flu-Vaccine-Effectiveness" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;flu.com&lt;/a&gt;, even vaccines, even with lower effectiveness, can mean the difference between a mild illness and a hospital stay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have suggested flu vaccination lowers the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 41% in young children and 82% in adults. People who who still get sick with flu even after getting the vaccine are also less likely to be admitted to the ICU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ ALSO: &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Texas school confirms case of rubella as measles outbreak in state reaches 146&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html" target="_blank" title="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that the current flu season has resulted in at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths as of Feb. 15, 2025. The senators warned that any delay in the VRBPAC meeting could impact the availability and effectiveness of flu vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the FDA canceling the meeting, the CDC also &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/fda-annual-flu-vaccine-meeting-and-cdc-s-wild-to-mild-campaign-canceled" target="_blank" title="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/fda-annual-flu-vaccine-meeting-and-cdc-s-wild-to-mild-campaign-canceled" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;canceled &lt;/a&gt;its "Wild to Mild" campaign which aims at promoting flu vaccinations. The campaign was revealed in the fall of 2023, aiming to "reset public expectations around the benefits of flu vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Cornell University showed better protection and broader immunity to various flu strains could be achieved by taking a COVID-flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter questioned Dr. Makary's stance on public health leadership, urging him to clarify his position on vaccine skepticism. "We intend to use your nomination hearing next week to understand whether you support this ill-informed measure to slow critical public health decision making," the senators stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Makary is scheduled to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee on March 6 for his nomination hearing. The senators requested that he be prepared to address several questions regarding the rescheduling of the VRBPAC meeting and his commitment to accepting expert recommendations for vaccine development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:10:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxPUDM1RG5IT2RnOG5tQ1ExNzZzdWtiN2F5R1hZNFZaQWQtX0Z4dS01VDlrWDhGTllTOU5ydWRGWFlfX2xFN0ZTU2Q1NVE1cnlNWlJGYWVoMkRSbGUzUnZCX1IwcGVLd2x3WXNlTXBsUE9TM3hnSzFWZHlYNzdvWG5GQ1RIbmtiLWpvM2YwZkxGcHFjSkd6ejZIZVhuZzhfODFTS3lJYUJGQmQ5bWdFeEpTcVA1dnA3bkk</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr. tells parents to consider MMR vaccine amid outbreak - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNVHV5LUptdkc4U01aMHozUjVNNUp0bER1aEs4bDVSNmlxLUdBa0FjOW9Bb1VyQWV6UU55WnoyeTd2blFfcDNYaEtvQmZWR042b3R2aTJJR2FHTDN0c2RHUWtHRkhUSV96T1hRR3FXT2lsUUVEQXR0OU1ZSEZlYklhZ0d6NExUb0poQ0hBN0tfeGlQSjVEc2dxNXln0gGfAUFVX3lxTE9ac0xuV3dBdWpuOGRhVWNQVWpiTUdLYkIwTVJTNklRVWFRNFF1Nm5OQUdwRjB3czlHSmI0QTF4Vi03WC13blJOUnFhSEZzUGFaM1BZc1ZscW82LWZUZHQ0MVpLYjBzcDN2TmpFOHRjTzlfelQ3TjlHR1JaOUR2dmFHMEJpWWZOUjNiWnRkbk9vbVJId3l0ZVlQaGdGUmJzaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

This recall now expands to all "raw material sharing similar production dates and lot codes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have one of the affected products, throw it out immediately — but do so securely, so no other animals can get a hold of it. You can also request a refund from where you bought it.

I didn't know where it came from, and until they you know, then we had our meetings, and they told us it was like inherited from your parents," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynch Syndrome is caused by genetic mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes. The mostly hereditary disorder increases the chances of certain cancers, including colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;38-year-old Tanya discovered she had Lynch Syndrome just before turning 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Almost like a cloud of doom, and I eventually turned it into, well, this is a good thing, like I can take action and take the steps to get the testing done and meet with my doctors every year to see what else I need to do," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've seen a rise in the number of young people with cancer, most commonly left-sided colon cancer, and unfortunately, a lot of times, is already metastasized to other organs at the time of presentation," said LVHN oncologist Dr. Maged Khalil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says colon cancer screenings now need to start at age 45. Warning signs are blood in the stool, consistent stomach pains, and anemia, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cure rate is, is great, is in the 90% time," Dr. Khalil said on catching it early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Hughes and Romig stress getting screened can be cause for a family celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would, if you have anything doesn't look right down there, I would surely go to the doctor as soon as possible and get it checked out," Romig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While these diseases tend to be the result of a combination of genetic, physiological and environmental factors, behavioral factors also come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest behavioral — and preventable — risk factors include: insufficient physical activity, unhealthy diets, harmful use of alcohol and tobacco use, according to a December &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/noncommunicable-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, there is one brain hack that could help keep a healthy habit: preaching.

The same way a vegetarian probably wouldn't wonder whether or not to eat a steak for dinner, or someone who is kosher wouldn't wake up wondering if they should eat bacon for breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you tell other people: 'keto is the way,' or 'I read this book and now I'm a follower of this methodology,' or whatever the case might be — by preaching about it, you're more likely to abide by it," Eyal told &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/"&gt;CNBC Make It.&lt;/a&gt; "What would otherwise just be an opinion, becomes an identity, and that's when it's very, very hard to shape."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with identity reinforcement, consistency bias is another reason why preaching could help with being consistent with a good habit, according to Eyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the work from the 1980s by &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016502548901200305" target="_blank"&gt;Robert Cialdini&lt;/a&gt;, it's a well-known principle that we seek to be consistent with our past behavior, and in psychology, we call this a &lt;a href="https://advertising.sagepub.com/blog/the-consistency-bias/" target="_blank"&gt;consistency bias&lt;/a&gt;," Eyal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't want to be inconsistent because it makes us look like liars," he said. "So, if you say one thing, you seek to be consistent with what you said. Ironically, even if, deep down, you want to change your mind, it's difficult to do, because you were already committed to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social pressure also plays a role. "When we declare something publicly, we are held accountable to it based on our social bonds," Eyal said. There's a fear that if we abandon our habits or publicly-stated beliefs, it can reflect poorly on us or ostracize us from our community, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're a very social species, so anything that threatens our group identity is very terrifying, so we're more likely to stay consistent," Eyal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an important caveat is that we shouldn't be a "jerk" about it, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is also a great way to lose friends. If people think you're putting yourself in one group and putting them in a different group — that can be harmful. So you want to make sure that [while] something is good for you, [it's] not alienating to others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to make extra money outside of your day job?&lt;/strong&gt; Sign up for CNBC's online course &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://cnb.cx/4a0v4qh" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Earn Passive Income Online&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it-newsletters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 23:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxORzdwR29BTnVmMUdoRFp2VjktZVVRcGdHbE90blRXaVNWQkUzaW1vMXNPMTJXdFowQXFGc2RNdjlsQWVQdmVxWWkzeTR3OVVWN255bUdxTll1d0ppLURiMFI2QjR3NFZZbE1CZXBXVDBMc3c2ZF9WazQyb1lCdUpzUjd3Mm54TVdaV0ZZLVdpQ1pYbzBocUk1amVhVkZjTzJJ0gGmAUFVX3lxTFBabFhTWGdGSTFjazREcXR5YnhQcXByUVlpeTNhVzBKUGVVamMwVWV3YWZXWWxsMGVacXZtaG1IRHhSbEUwbXZPSDVleTZEWmhmZ01Zc0RSRjRtM1VpcDBfU0NZTkNmMVdXTVJTMThEU015dlY3SXhhSUY5MEY5WUpxdWlvMWJmWlc4NHFWSThDTC0tNko1aXVnZ1BxT2ljb3gxX213NVE</guid></item><item><title>This brain hack can help you follow through on good habits, says behavioral design expert - CNBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxORzdwR29BTnVmMUdoRFp2VjktZVVRcGdHbE90blRXaVNWQkUzaW1vMXNPMTJXdFowQXFGc2RNdjlsQWVQdmVxWWkzeTR3OVVWN255bUdxTll1d0ppLURiMFI2QjR3NFZZbE1CZXBXVDBMc3c2ZF9WazQyb1lCdUpzUjd3Mm54TVdaV0ZZLVdpQ1pYbzBocUk1amVhVkZjTzJJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBody-styles-makeit-articleBody--AEqcE" id="MakeItRegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-1" data-analytics="MakeItRegularArticle-articleBody-5-1"&gt;&lt;span class="HighlightShare-styles-makeit-hidden--MFwCR"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-styles-makeit-imageEmbed--kbwfw" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108109597" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-styles-makeit-wrapper--AxC3F"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-styles-makeit-captionContainer--Ef7Yz"&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-styles-makeit-imageEmbedCaption--mfcME"&gt;Keeping a good habit isn't easy, but one mental hack that can help with staying consistent is preaching about it, says behavioral design expert Nir Eyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-styles-makeit-imageEmbedCredit--SQGa6"&gt;Kobus Louw | E+ | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/this-3-step-process-will-help-you-break-bad-habits.html"&gt;resolutions&lt;/a&gt; is easier than following through on them.

"So, if you say one thing, you seek to be consistent with what you said. Ironically, even if, deep down, you want to change your mind, it's difficult to do, because you were already committed to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social pressure also plays a role. "When we declare something publicly, we are held accountable to it based on our social bonds," Eyal said. There's a fear that if we abandon our habits or publicly-stated beliefs, it can reflect poorly on us or ostracize us from our community, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're a very social species, so anything that threatens our group identity is very terrifying, so we're more likely to stay consistent," Eyal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an important caveat is that we shouldn't be a "jerk" about it, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is also a great way to lose friends. If people think you're putting yourself in one group and putting them in a different group — that can be harmful. So you want to make sure that [while] something is good for you, [it's] not alienating to others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to make extra money outside of your day job?&lt;/strong&gt; Sign up for CNBC's online course &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://cnb.cx/4a0v4qh" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Earn Passive Income Online&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to learn about common passive income streams, tips to get started and real-life success stories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plus, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it-newsletters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 23:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxORzdwR29BTnVmMUdoRFp2VjktZVVRcGdHbE90blRXaVNWQkUzaW1vMXNPMTJXdFowQXFGc2RNdjlsQWVQdmVxWWkzeTR3OVVWN255bUdxTll1d0ppLURiMFI2QjR3NFZZbE1CZXBXVDBMc3c2ZF9WazQyb1lCdUpzUjd3Mm54TVdaV0ZZLVdpQ1pYbzBocUk1amVhVkZjTzJJ</guid></item><item><title>Kennedy sends mixed vaccine messages amid Texas measles outbreak - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQUWNnMEVBcHI4cWh6eHAwRVJqdHBBRTBNc3pPTloyZzladXlMQTVVd1BSZUszUTh1VHBEcnE0eUZuLVN4SGdhT1lfTmpmMlo3TS1uY0xJS3dqQ0hpQjFQbVduWXhRbldfbTlobmNLd2RNMEJ6TzdiZTRYRGtFWFRJczVGcDhrLUFQV1ExYdIBkgFBVV95cUxNYW5nVXFGZnExdEdHWlV0S3hQSFhrcDZFcVJFZmZ6LV8tMy1HQ1A1OEd3WkNEazlLZ3lVWnVnVnBLVXFtN1g3T3ZvUEpTR0Z3RW5KSU1uWDk1djBoejhwS1BNVG55dEQweTU4bURZT01XcXZDeG8tcDJVbnY0QmJyTXQxNXMycFhBenRXR3VaQ1Zfdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Even small shifts toward a Western diet correlated with a 66% higher risk of ADHD and a 122% higher risk of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations were observed during the first and second trimesters, suggesting that early fetal brain development is particularly sensitive to maternal nutrition. Researchers identified specific blood metabolites linked to diet that may explain this connection, highlighting the potential for dietary interventions to support neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; A Western diet during pregnancy was linked to a 66% higher risk of ADHD and a 122% higher risk of autism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Window:&lt;/strong&gt; The strongest associations were found in the first and second trimesters, emphasizing early fetal brain sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential for Intervention:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest that even small dietary improvements may help reduce neurodevelopmental risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking, alcohol, and unhealthy diets have long been known to influence fetal development. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a comprehensive clinical study from the University of Copenhagen and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC) at the Danish Paediatric Asthma Centre, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, has found an association between maternal diet during pregnancy and the development of ADHD and autism in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The greater a woman’s adherence to a Western diet in pregnancy – high in fat, sugar, and refined products while low in fish, vegetables, and fruit—the greater the risk appears to be for her child developing ADHD or autism,” says lead author, Dr David Horner, MD, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108029"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two pregnant women and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/maternal-diet-asd-adhd-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study finds a strong association between a Western dietary pattern during pregnancy and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD and autism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified a Western dietary pattern using data-driven analysis. Even moderate shifts along this dietary spectrum were associated with a markedly increased risk. For example, slight deviations towards a more Western diet were linked to a 66% increased risk of ADHD and a 122% increased risk of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this also presents an opportunity: even small dietary adjustments away from a Western pattern could potentially reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over 60,000 Mother-Child Pairs Analysed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reach these findings, researchers analysed dietary patterns, blood samples, and ADHD diagnoses across four large independent cohorts in Denmark and the United States, encompassing more than 60,000 mother-child pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples were analysed using metabolomics, providing insights into the biological mechanisms linking diet to neurodevelopmental disorders and serving as a validation method for the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between Western dietary patterns and ADHD was observed across all four cohorts and validated in three of them using three different methods, reinforcing the study’s credibility, according to David Horner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study draws on a highly detailed and robust dataset where nearly 600 children were clinically assessed for neurodevelopmental disorders at age 10. To ensure the reliability of the findings, researchers accounted for a range of factors, including genetics, which is known to play a major role in neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, a clear association between a maternal Western diet and the risk of ADHD and autism remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “A Western dietary pattern during pregnancy is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood and adolescence,” has been published today in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greatest Risk in Early Pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key strengths of this study is the high quality of the biological samples, which included repeated metabolomic measurements throughout pregnancy and childhood. This allowed researchers to demonstrate that the association of diet on ADHD risk was strongest in early and mid-pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When comparing across cohorts, we observed the strongest associations in the first and second trimesters, suggesting that brain development during this period is particularly sensitive to maternal nutritional influences,” explains senior author Professor Morten Arendt Rasmussen from the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified 43 specific metabolites in maternal blood that were linked to a Western diet and could help explain the connection between diet and neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that 15 of these 43 metabolites were particularly linked to the increased risk of ADHD. Many of these metabolites are derived from dietary intake and play key roles in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress—factors believed to be critical in early neurodevelopment,” says David Horner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are Current Dietary Guidelines for Pregnant Women Effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to David Horner, this study raises important questions about whether current dietary guidelines for pregnant women are sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Denmark, dietary recommendations for pregnant women largely mirror those for the general population, emphasising a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and fish rather than red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that nutritional demands increase during pregnancy, and our study highlights just how crucial dietary composition is for foetal development. While the Nordic diet is often considered healthy, our data show that many pregnant women follow dietary patterns that could be optimised to better support their child’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study raises the question of whether existing dietary recommendations are sufficiently followed during pregnancy—and whether they have the desired impact on child health,” says David Horner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that the study not only demonstrates an association between diet and ADHD risk but also provides insights into specific nutrients and food groups that could play a vital role in foetal brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our analysis not only confirms a strong link between diet and ADHD risk but also identifies specific nutrients and foods that could serve as the foundation for improved dietary guidelines and preventative strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By understanding how maternal diet influences foetal development, we can better identify the key nutrients and dietary adjustments needed to reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. This opens new possibilities for refining dietary recommendations and promoting healthier outcomes for future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted by COPSAC and the University of Copenhagen, in collaboration with the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) and the VDAART cohort in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study finds a strong association between a Western dietary pattern during pregnancy and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings for ADHD were validated in 3 independent mother-child cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations between a Western diet and ADHD risk were observed in the first and second trimesters, suggesting that foetal brain development during this period is particularly sensitive to maternal nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used a combination of dietary records, blood analyses, genetic data, and clinical diagnoses from four large mother-child cohorts to investigate whether a Western diet during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of ADHD and autism in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Four Cohorts Analysed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;COPSAC2010 (Denmark, 508 mother-child pairs) – Primary cohort with detailed neurodevelopmental clinical assessments at 10 years, and five metabolomics time points in both mother and child, as well as foetal dry blood spot metabolomics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC, Denmark, 59,725 mother-child pairs) – Large population-based study used to validate FFQ-based dietary patterns against ADHD diagnoses in national registers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;VDAART (USA, 656 mother-child pairs) – Used to validate dietary patterns and blood metabolites from both pregnancy and childhood in relation to ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;COPSAC2000 (Denmark, 348 mother-child pairs) – Used to analyse fetal dry blood spot metabolomes to identify a metabolic signature of a Western dietary pattern and validate its link to ADHD symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, meaning it shows a strong statistical association but does not conclusively prove that a Western diet causes ADHD or autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary information was collected through self-reported food frequency questionnaires (FFQ), which may introduce recall bias and inaccuracies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, dietary patterns were identified using data-driven methods (minimising bias), and machine learning models were employed to identify metabolite scores as an objective biomarker.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Genetics also play a major role. ADHD and autism have a high genetic component (up to 80% heritability).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women with a more Western diet often had higher BMI, smoked during pregnancy, and used more antibiotics, which may independently effect child development. The study adjusted for these factors but cannot fully rule out other lifestyle influences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pregnancy, diet, and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e0ad938aa0938389858e8385ce8b95ce848b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Michael Jensen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ku.dk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Michael Jensen – University of Copenhagen&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01230-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A western dietary pattern during pregnancyis associated with neurodevelopmentaldisorders in childhood and adolescence&lt;/a&gt;” by David Horner et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A western dietary pattern during pregnancyis associated with neurodevelopmentaldisorders in childhood and adolescence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the high prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders, the influence of maternal diet during pregnancy on child neurodevelopment remains understudied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that a western dietary pattern during pregnancy is associated with child neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyse self-reported maternal dietary patterns at 24 weeks of pregnancy and clinically evaluated neurodevelopmental disorders at 10 years of age in the COPSAC2010 cohort (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 508).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We find significant associations with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We validate the ADHD findings in three large, independent mother–child cohorts (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 59,725, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 656 and &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 348) through self-reported dietary modelling, maternal blood metabolomics and foetal blood metabolomics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolome analyses identify 15 mediating metabolites in pregnancy that improve ADHD prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal blood metabolome analyses, incorporating five time points per cohort in two independent cohorts, reveal that associations between western dietary pattern metabolite scores and neurodevelopmental outcomes are consistently significant in early–mid-pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the potential for targeted prenatal dietary interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental disorders and emphasise the importance of early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 22:52:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBfVk5xckJMczJ5WGhTTG9HdURXdG5wdEdvX1k0aFltRlJkbTMtYXhEVnl1QkVaeGZRaUZ2WjZyNmJoMFctU1d4b20xTHBLaFJNUHNCNUVva19za3VzT0FUcXY4LWY2Mk01dVI0</guid></item><item><title>Brain Changes From Early-Life Stress May Be Reversible - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTFBqVXJBTDNkdlFiVDNrQmh4Y0xYekxSTW1kVlRVTlRSUExhekIwU21kWWZkQ3F4bXBQNUNqeVZWMW9jNGVrU3FoMnhPajZ0c3FvSGdKaDVUMzYtM21RTkpIV0p2VUlzM1MzV0ZYSUVZNHlpZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals how prenatal infections followed by early-life stress—known as “two-hit stress”—can lead to brain dysfunction and psychiatric-like behaviors. Researchers found that affected mice showed abnormal cerebellar activity, increased microglial turnover, and impaired brain-wide connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, microglia replacement therapy successfully reversed these effects, offering a potential new approach for mental health treatments.

If you’ve constantly experienced stress since before birth, you may be in for an especially tough time. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our emotions may be influenced by infections experienced in the mother’s womb.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Kyoto University recently set out to understand the mechanisms behind which two-hit stress contributes to brain dysfunction and mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conducted a comprehensive investigation of the social and cognitive behaviors of mice that have been exposed to such stress, paying particular attention to anxiety-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, this team demonstrated that acute inflammation in the cerebellum caused by a bacterial infection induces &lt;em&gt;neural plasticity&lt;/em&gt;, which in turn may lead to hyper-excitability in the brain and the onset of depressive and autism-like symptoms. Yet exactly how two-hit stress contributes to changes in the brain had remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject mice in the current investigation were allowed to freely explore, revealing extensive behavioral differences in two-hit mice, correlating with abnormalities in the cerebellum. In particular, the researchers observed a significant increase in the number and turnover of &lt;em&gt;microglia&lt;/em&gt;, the primary immune cells found in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed neuronal loss in the cerebellum, a reduction in the action potential firing of remaining cerebellar neurons, and a decrease in brain-wide functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate cerebellar cognitive dysfunctions in animals exposed to two-hit stress,” says team member Momoka Hikosaka. The exposure to such stress altered the microglial reactivity in the cerebella of both male and female mice, leading to cerebellar dysfunction and behaviors resembling psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not all bad news. To rescue the exposed mice, the researchers used &lt;em&gt;microglia replacement&lt;/em&gt; to ameliorate the effects of two-hit stress. Suppressing microglia can also be effective, but systemic depletion of microglia typically weakens immunity, making the body more susceptible to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To address this limitation, our team performed cerebellum-specific microglia replacement, which worked remarkably well,” says corresponding author Gen Ohtsuki, adding, “We were impressed to observe that the female mice showed notably higher stress resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that in some animals, sex differences in response to chronic inflammatory stress emerge in the cerebellum under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, personalized medicine for mental health may require considering sex differences as an important factor, which could also be applied to neurodegenerative diseases and aging treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings provide new pathways for understanding the biological mechanisms behind mental disorders, and have the potential to transform both scientific approaches and societal attitudes toward helping those affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and stress research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#650d1007070009094b120d0c110b001c4b5104250e1c0a110a48104b04064b0f15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Whitney Hubbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kyoto-u.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kyoto University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Whitney Hubbell – Kyoto University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07566-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Maternal immune activation followed by peripubertal stress combinedly produce reactive microglia and confine cerebellar cognition&lt;/a&gt;” by Momoka Hikosaka et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maternal immune activation followed by peripubertal stress combinedly produce reactive microglia and confine cerebellar cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functional alteration of microglia arises in brains exposed to external stress during early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathophysiological findings of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder suggest cerebellar functional deficits. However, the link between stress-induced microglia reactivity and cerebellar dysfunction is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigate the developmental immune environment in translational mouse models that combine two risk factors: maternal infection and repeated social defeat stress (2HIT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find the synergy of inflammatory stress insults, leading to microglial increase specifically in the cerebellum of both sexes. Microglial turnover correlates with the Purkinje neuron loss in 2HIT mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly multiplexed imaging-mass-cytometry identifies a cell transition to TREM2(+) stress-associated microglia in the cerebellum. Single-cell-proteomic clustering reveals IL-6- and TGFβ-signaling association with microglial cell transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced excitability of remaining Purkinje cells, cerebellum-involved brain-wide functional dysconnectivity, and behavioral abnormalities indicate cerebellar cognitive dysfunctions in 2HIT animals, which are ameliorated by both systemic and cerebellum-specific microglia replacement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 22:37:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBqVXJBTDNkdlFiVDNrQmh4Y0xYekxSTW1kVlRVTlRSUExhekIwU21kWWZkQ3F4bXBQNUNqeVZWMW9jNGVrU3FoMnhPajZ0c3FvSGdKaDVUMzYtM21RTkpIV0p2VUlzM1MzV0ZYSUVZNHlpZw</guid></item><item><title>Cluster of community deaths in Basankusu, Equateur- Democratic Republic of the Congo - World Health Organization</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBYMWF6RU55QWRqdk5GaU9GTWRsd1BhY3Qwb3h3SXR1bVVhaGM0WUdPd2FNUGltWTNGb3RIeUpoc0Zaam8zU0ptNDBzRHktWnFKU0V4QzRSNGZBNU9zRzRXaGN4RFZUTF9OUkE2YUgtdWRpVkE4dk1NdWt3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="don-content"&gt;
            On 9 February 2025, officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported to regional health authorities a cluster of 24 unexplained community deaths in a single village in Ekoto health area, Basankusu health zone, Equateur province. As of 25 February, a total of 53 deaths have been reported, with the last death occurring on 22 February. Deaths have occurred in all age groups, but adolescents and young adults, particularly males, appeared to be disproportionately affected in the initial cluster reported. Disease progression appeared to be fast, with a median time from onset of symptoms to death of one day. 

Given the rapid decline in the incidence of reported deaths, their geographic clustering, the age profile of deaths and the rapid disease progression in the initial cluster, working hypotheses include chemical poisoning or a rapid onset bacterial meningitis cluster, on a background of malaria and other infectious illnesses endemic in the region. The definitive cause of illness remains undetermined, with initial samples testing negative for Ebola and Marburg viruses. Field investigations and additional laboratory testing are ongoing including but not limited to the cerebrospinal fluid testing and the toxicological analysis of environmental samples, including water and other samples to explore chemical causes. 

Local authorities began surveillance with a broad case definition including any individual with fever and at least one other symptom, to better understand disease patterns. A total of 1318 patients had symptoms meeting the working suspected case definition as of 25 February 2025. Approximately 50% of malaria tests performed on these cases tested positive for malaria, the cases identified through this enhanced surveillance therefore likely reflect the various febrile illnesses in the area. With the available information, WHO assesses the local public health risk as moderate, and the national and global public health risk as low. 
        &lt;/p&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;On 9 February 2025, an initial cluster of 24 community deaths of unknown origin were reported from a single village in Ekoto Health Area, Basankusu Health Zone, Equateur province, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This triggered an investigation by the Ministry of Health, supported by WHO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced surveillance was implemented shortly after, using a broad working case definition given the limited details on the clinical presentation, disease progression, demographic and other characteristics of the initial cluster. As of 25 February, a total of 53 deaths were reported (Figure 1). Deaths occurred across all age groups, but compared to the age and sex distribution of the population, appeared to disproportionately affect adolescents and young adult males, particularly in the initial cluster (Figure 2). This further pointed to an unusual event, as mortality from common causes in the area is usually highest among the elderly, and among young children (under five years) in a context of a high burden from infectious diseases, including malaria. The majority of deaths (50) occurred in the same village (Figure 3). Furthermore, the incidence of death rapidly declined following the initial cluster (Figure 1), suggesting this is not an event spreading in time or place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preliminary findings of the in-depth analysis revealed that the median time from symptom onset to death in the initial cluster was one day, with a mean time of two days. Symptoms reported include fever, chills, headaches, muscle aches, abdominal pains, diarrhea, sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath, agitation, and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Epidemic curve showing deaths reported between 9 February and 25 February 2025, Basankusu health zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo. * &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Number of deaths" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/epi_deaths.jpg?sfvrsn=f449cb4e_3" sf-size="205557"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Based on the line list available for deaths (n=53) as of 25 February 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Age-sex distribution of cases and deaths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; reported between 9 February to 25 February 2025, Basankusu health zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/age-sex-distribution.jpg?sfvrsn=f4f8685e_3" alt="Age sex distribution DRC" sf-size="144962"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3: Geographic distribution of all cases (left) and deaths (right) reported &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;between 9 February and 25 February 2025, Basankusu health zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/geographic-distribution-of-cases.jpg?sfvrsn=fffa2828_3" alt="Geographic distribution of cases and deaths" sf-size="157993"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Based on the line list available for suspected cases (n=1198) as of 25 February 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the initiation of enhanced surveillance,1318 people reported symptoms meeting the working suspected case definition. However, given the broad nature of the case definition (fever and one other symptom from a range of general respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurological symptoms), the trends in cases are difficult to interpret, and most likely reflect the prevalence of a range of febrile illnesses in the community. This is further suggested by the age distribution broadly mirroring that of the population (Figure 2), and the high malaria positivity among cases that were tested (approximately 50% positive on rapid diagnostic tests), which is not deemed unusual in an area where malaria is hyperendemic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4: Epidemic curve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; showing suspected cases reported between 9 February to 25 February 2025, Basankusu health zone, Democratic Republic of the Congo. *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/epi_cases.jpg?sfvrsn=b0bb3d20_3" alt="Number of cases" sf-size="233114"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Based on the line list available for suspected cases (n=1198/1318) as of 25 February 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the cases were initially identified using a broad (i.e. non-specific) case definition, given the localized nature of the cluster of deaths, the steady decline in incidence of deaths, the demographic profile of deaths, and the rapid disease progression in the initial cluster, working hypotheses are that of a contamination by a chemical poisoning–be it accidental or deliberate—or possibly a rapid onset bacterial meningitis cluster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial laboratory test results released on 13 February 2025 were negative for both Marburg and Ebola. Additional samples (blood, urine, oral, nasal) have been collected for further testing and investigations are ongoing. In addition, environmental samples–including water and other samples–are being collected to explore chemical causes, such as contamination by organophosphates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definitive cause of illness remains undetermined. Further testing and field investigations are ongoing to better characterize the cases and deaths. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of note, this event in Basankusu follows a recent cluster of community deaths in the Bolomba Health Zone, which occurred from 10 to 27 January 2025. The epidemiological investigation documented 12 cases with eight deaths. Laboratory testing excluded Ebola and Marburg virus diseases and suggested that severe malaria could be the cause. While both Bolomba and Basankusu are located within Equateur Province, these health zones are separated by approximately 175 kilometers of difficult terrain including dense forests and poor road infrastructure; epidemiological investigation has found no evidence linking these distinct events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since the initial cluster of deaths was reported on 9 February 2025, there has been an overall downward trend in deaths. The most recent death was reported on 22 February 2025. Current epidemiological information suggests a localized event with a steady decline in incidence, not expanding in time and place. Given the clinical presentation of deaths and the speed from symptom onset to death in this unusual cluster, current differentials include a rapid onset bacterial meningitis cluster or a contamination by a chemical poisoning as key hypotheses in a context of high incidence of other common infectious diseases in the areas, particularly malaria. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Operational challenges related to this event involve the isolation of Basankusu and resulting logistical barriers, as it is located in a forested region, approximately 450 kilometers from the nearest major city of Mbandaka and has poor infrastructure. The remoteness of Basankusu has hindered the timeliness of the initial investigation and response activities and poses challenges to laboratory testing. Samples must be collected, stored, and shipped long distances to a larger city with laboratory testing capacity (either Mbandaka or Kinshasa), introducing delays in diagnosis. Access to care is another key challenge, as the region lacks robust healthcare services, and the region’s poor infrastructure makes travel to neighboring health zones difficult, leading to delays in treatment.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The province faces a severe urban water crisis with only 5% of its urban population having access to drinking water. The water network suffers frequent leaks and has never been rehabilitated. Many households rely on unregulated private water sources such as wells, springs and streams which pose contamination risks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With ongoing investigations and given that the causative agent of the cluster is not yet determined, there remains a level of risk attributed to the event. As such, the overall public health risk level to the affected communities is assessed as &lt;strong&gt;moderate. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the national level, however, the risk is considered &lt;strong&gt;low&lt;/strong&gt; due to the localized nature of the event and apparent decreasing incidence. Similarly, at the regional and global levels, the risk is &lt;strong&gt;low&lt;/strong&gt; at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To reduce the impact of the event in the Basankusu health zone, WHO advises the following measures:   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Careful characterization of the clinical syndrome and outcomes as well as an improved case definition based on collected information to better understand the outbreak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced surveillance focusing specifically on deaths, and severe febrile cases or severe cases of unexplained illness, with better clinical characterization to reinforce early case detection and reporting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continued laboratory testing and environmental assessments (including water sources) to evaluate the current hypotheses of meningitis and/or a toxin/poisoning event, particularly among severe cases and deaths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risk communication and community engagement to increase public awareness about the event, explaining symptoms and the importance of seeking immediate care. It is also critical to address any potential misinformation about the outbreak circulating in the community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; 
        &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical and emotional challenges “interact with each other and together shape the sexual experience,” wrote researchers in the Netherlands, who noted that “future research should focus on the patient as a whole person, and not solely on physical sexual functions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/11/1/e004990"&gt;Sexual experience and functioning in male and female patients with Sjögren’s disease: a qualitative study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;RMD Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sjögren’s is an autoimmune disease wherein the immune system mistakenly launches an attack against moisture-producing glands, such as those that produce tears and saliva. The most common &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; is unusual dryness in the eyes and mouth. But the disease can cause fatigue and other symptoms that &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/news/mental-physical-health-decline-sjogrens-syndrome-symptoms-daily-activities/"&gt;interfere with daily activities&lt;/a&gt;, including sexual relations. In women, vaginal dryness can make sexual intercourse painful, while erectile dysfunction is a common complaint among men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the problem “has received limited attention in both research and clinical practice,” wrote the researchers, who interviewed 11 women and nine men, ages 24-65, to learn how Sjögren’s impacted their sexual lives. Seven (63.6%) of the women scored less than 26.55 points on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire, indicating sexual dysfunction, which can be defined as having difficulty during any stage of normal sexual activities. Two-thirds (66.7%) of the men scored less than 25 points in the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), indicating sexual dysfunction, in this case, difficulty getting and keeping an erection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Sexual challenges with Sjögren’s disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the interviews, which lasted an average of 1.5 hours, both women and men mentioned &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;symptoms of Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt;, stress, the fact that their disease isn’t visible, how they see and cope with their disease, the quality of their sexual relationships, and social taboos as factors that affect their sexual functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women experienced vaginal dryness and pain during sex, while men experienced erectile dysfunction. Even with treatments such as lubricants, these symptoms made some patients develop a poor body image and feel insecure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many faced trauma or long-term stress before their &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/diagnosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;diagnosis of Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt;, including divorce, abuse, or losing loved ones. Some shared these experiences openly, while others revealed them later. Many believed stress triggered their disease, making coping more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said symptoms like fatigue and pain caused discomfort and made physical intimacy difficult. Dry mouth made kissing painful and talking difficult, which affected being able to develop emotional bonds. The severity of symptoms also affected sexual satisfaction, leading some to focus on nonsexual intimacy instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Sjögren’s is an “invisible” disease, many patients felt misunderstood and alone, and didn’t share details at work or with loved ones. Those who stayed silent felt pressured “to live their life as ‘normal’ as possible,” while those who spoke up felt unheard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How the participants viewed their disease affected how they coped with sexual challenges. Some ignored their symptoms, while others used lubricants or adapted their sexual practices. Those who accepted their diagnosis coped better and felt more satisfied with their sex lives. Women were generally more open to finding solutions than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most patients found it difficult to talk about sexuality due to social taboos, especially those who had little emotional support growing up. Many felt alone and avoided discussing their challenges with doctors, fearing it was inappropriate. A lack of awareness among healthcare providers only made this worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even within strong and stable friendships, participants reported hesitance in addressing issues concerning their sexual problems and doubts because they considered this to be a too personal subject to discuss and/or they experienced shame and insecurity about the problems,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the study included only a small number of patients, it showed that “sexual experience in both female and male patients with [Sjögren’s disease] is shaped by far more factors than physical sexual functioning alone,” the researchers wrote. “Many of the interviewed patients reported an unmet need for support, advice, and treatment of sexuality-related symptoms related to [Sjögren’s disease] within healthcare,” showing there’s a need for better medical support and open discussions about sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;

Portland is the county seat of Multnomah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Known best for causing stomach cramps, vomiting, bloody diarrhea and fever - and perhaps for killing off countless characters in the beloved video game "&lt;a href="https://www.reviewed.com/tech/features/oregon-trail-apple-watch-hands-on?utm_source=usat&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=collab" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Oregon Trail&lt;/a&gt;" – dysentery has been consistently on the rise in the Portland region year-over-year since 2012, officials told KOIN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Data released by the health department showed several spikes in cases between 2017 and 2024, though last year's infection number of 158 in Multnomah County blew past years out of the water. That end-of-the-year number likewise represented a 62-case increase between 2024 and 2023 (96 infections.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Multnomah County Health Department did not immediately respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"&gt;Housing is a major factor in the spread, say Portland health officials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The dysentery infection currently spreading most prominently among Multnomah County is shigellosis, the most common form of dysentery infection caused by the shigella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/about/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; that in the U.S., approximately half a million people per year become infected with shigellosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the Portland area, health officials said 56% of cases were among people experiencing homelessness and 55% of cases reported methamphetamine and/or opiate usage. The spread is more prominent amongst drug users and men who have sexual contact with other men, as anal contact is more likely to spread the disease via infected fecal particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The rising rate of people with unstable housing situations in the metro area – and therefore less access to plumbing and other hygiene needs – has likely been a major contributor to the spread, something the city&lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/02/public-toilets-could-help-stop-the-spread-of-dysentery-yes-dysentery-in-portland.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt; previously tried to address&lt;/a&gt; by maintaining public toilets near areas with a high unhoused population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Housing is related to nearly all aspects of health, including infectious diseases,” the Multnomah County Health Department told KOIN in a statement. “Lacking housing creates a context that can increase the risk of multiple kinds of infectious disease. When you don’t have housing, it is harder to prevent infectious disease and harder to access care to treat disease compared to if you are housed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dr. John Townes, medical director for infection prevention and control at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, told &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2025/02/public-toilets-could-help-stop-the-spread-of-dysentery-yes-dysentery-in-portland.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;The Oregonian&lt;/a&gt; the trend can be curbed by simple, increased access to public toilets and handwash stations year-round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“If you want to stop an outbreak of shigella, you give people toilets and soap and water,” Townes told the outlet. “And you train them in how to wash their hands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The local health department is working to provide temporary housing for those who do test positive, both local outlets reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"&gt;What is dysentery?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dysentery is a gastrointestinal disease caused by an infection that is most commonly recognized by the trademark symptom of bloody diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are two main types, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23567-dysentery" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;: Amoebic dysentery (amoebiasis), which is caused by a parasite, most commonly one called Entamoeba histolytica. People in the U.S. are more likely to become infected with this form of dysentery if they recently traveled to a country with poorer water sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The second type, Bacillary dysentery, is caused by a bacterial infection and is the most common type of dysentery. Some of the most common bacteria that cause this form of dysentery include shigella, salmonella, campylobacter and E. coli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The most common form is dysentery caused by the shigella bacteria, in which case the infection is called shigellosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Dysentery of any kind is most commonly spread via the ingestion of food or water that has been handled by an infected person. Because it spreads through trace fecal particles, unwashed hands can often be the culprit for the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/03/USAT/81175745007-getty-images-2156313024.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/03/03/USAT/81175745007-getty-images-2156313024.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Dysentery is often spread via contaminated water and food."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Dysentery is often spread via contaminated water and food." data-c-credit="Tomas Vynikal, Getty Images"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_mt"&gt;Symptoms of dysentery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Some major symptoms, like diarrhea, are consistent across infection types.

&lt;p&gt;Allison Burk’s daughter was struggling. The American &lt;strong&gt;teenager &lt;/strong&gt;had uncontrolled emotions, a decreased ability to pay attention and trouble completing work on time. A family doctor suggested testing for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to an unexpected discovery: The teen had ADHD, and her mother, Allison Burk, did too. During her daughter’s testing, Burk thought, “Wait a minute. This sounds &lt;strong&gt;familiar&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was able to piece together that this might be something I was experiencing,” said Burk, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. She sought testing for herself and was &lt;strong&gt;diagnosed&lt;/strong&gt; with ADHD — at 42 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More adults are being diagnosed with ADHD. Diagnoses have been rising for at least 20 years but seem to have increased sharply in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent government study suggested that more than 15 million adults in the United States — about 1 in 17 — have been diagnosed with ADHD. The condition starts in childhood, but about half of adults with ADHD are diagnosed when they are 18 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some doctors say the number of people seeking ADHD testing is sharply increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just in our &lt;strong&gt;clinic&lt;/strong&gt;, requests for &lt;strong&gt;assessments&lt;/strong&gt; have doubled in the last two years,” said Justin Barterian. He is a &lt;strong&gt;psychologist &lt;/strong&gt;based at Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs of ADHD in adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD makes it hard for people to pay attention and control their behaviors. The disorder can be genetic. Doctors often treat the disorder with drugs, behavioral therapy, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judy Sandler is 62 years old and lives in the U.S. state of Maine. She was diagnosed in her 50s. Sandler describes what ADHD feels like for her. “It’s like there’s an engine in you and you feel like it’s always running, and you can’t turn it off except with medication,” Sandler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wsw__embed"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD has been called the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorder in American children. More than 7 million children in the U.S. have been diagnosed. The disorder was once thought to be something that resolved as children became adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, experts say they believe that many people are not diagnosed as kids and that the disorder continues into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with the condition talk about having trouble &lt;strong&gt;focusing&lt;/strong&gt; on immediate responsibilities and planning their time. Some say the disorder has led to problems in their personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnoses have been rising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses have been increasing in both kids and adults. The recent government report also found adult ADHD was more common than earlier estimates had suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t had (federal) adult ADHD data in a long time,” said Angelika Claussen. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researcher was one of the study’s writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were signs of the rise, she added. Increasing demand for ADHD medication led to severe shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. A 2023 study showed the rise in prescriptions, or doctors’ orders for such medication, was notable in adults — especially among women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADHD diagnoses and medication were increasing before the pandemic. This is partly because of a change in general diagnostic measures in 2013. Those changes expanded the definition of ADHD and reduced the number of signs, or symptoms, required for diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cases really seemed to increase in 2020, when schools closed and many adults were forced to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very difficult to focus when you are home and you have kids,” Claussen said. She said such conditions may have worsened ADHD symptoms in people with less severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How ADHD is diagnosed in adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say that it was long believed that ADHD was underdiagnosed in adults. Now, experts debate about whether it has become over-diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no blood or brain test for the disorder. Experts say it is diagnosed when symptoms cause ongoing problems in more than one area of life, and when those symptoms began in early childhood. Experts say the best way professionals diagnose ADHD is by getting careful histories from patients and from people who know them. They also might test a patient’s memory and ability to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But getting an appointment with a mental health professional can take months. And assessments can cost thousands of dollars. Many people turn to family doctors. People also take online diagnostic tests, some of which are linked to health companies that &lt;strong&gt;prescribe&lt;/strong&gt; medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a wide &lt;strong&gt;variability&lt;/strong&gt; in this country in how people diagnose, how &lt;strong&gt;strict&lt;/strong&gt; they are, and who they diagnose,” said Margaret Sibley. She is psychologist at University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Professional Society of ADHD and Related Disorders is preparing a set of diagnosis and treatment guidelines for American health professionals who treat adults. Sibley is leading the work on the guidelines, which the organization expects to release later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week, were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;. And the first-line medical treatment for nightmares has already been shown to decrease the build-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012004666?via%3Dihub"&gt;abnormal proteins&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormal clumps of amyloid-beta proteins are linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="153762" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.803220/full"&gt;case reports&lt;/a&gt; showing improvements in memory and thinking skills after treating nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that treating nightmares might help to slow cognitive decline and to prevent dementia from developing in some people. This will be an important avenue to explore in future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next steps for my research include investigating whether nightmares in young people might also be linked to increased dementia risk. This could help to determine whether nightmares cause dementia, or whether they are simply an early sign in some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also plan to investigate whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember our dreams and how vivid they are, might also help to determine how likely people are to develop dementia in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research might not only help to shed light on the relationship between dementia and dreaming, and provide new opportunities for earlier diagnoses – and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;earlier interventions&lt;/a&gt; – but it may also shed new light on the nature and function of the mysterious phenomenon that we call &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-do-we-dream/"&gt;dreaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/191016/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Researchers tracked brain activity in epilepsy patients with implanted electrodes and found that this region encodes pitch accents as meaningful linguistic signals, separate from word sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery challenges long-held assumptions that prosody processing occurs later in the brain and suggests that humans uniquely extract meaning from pitch variations. The findings could improve speech therapy, AI voice recognition, and our understanding of language disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Prosody Processing:&lt;/strong&gt; Heschl’s gyrus encodes pitch accents before higher speech centers process meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Human Ability:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike non-human primates, humans abstract pitch changes into meaningful language cues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; These insights could advance speech therapy, AI voice recognition, and linguistic research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve probably heard the phrase, “It’s not what you say, it’s how you say it,” and now, science backs it up. A first-of-its-kind study from Northwestern University’s School of Communication, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Wisconsin-Madison reveals a region of the brain, long known for early auditory processing, plays a far greater role in interpreting speech than previously understood. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multidisciplinary study being published Monday, March 3 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications &lt;/em&gt;found a brain region known as Heschl’s gyrus doesn’t just process sounds — it transforms subtle changes in pitch, known as prosody, into meaningful linguistic information that guides how humans understand emphasis, intent and focus in conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108010"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman talking." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/speech-melody-meaning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The brain encoded pitch accents separately from the sounds that make up words. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists believed that all aspects of prosody were primarily processed in the superior temporal gyrus, a brain region known for speech perception. Bharath Chandrasekaran, the study’s co-principal investigator and professor and chair of the Roxelyn and Richard Pepper Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at Northwestern, said the findings challenge long-held assumptions about how, where and the speed at which prosody is processed in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results redefine our understanding of the architecture of speech perception,” Chandrasekaran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve spent a few decades researching the nuances of how speech is abstracted in the brain, but this is the first study to investigate how subtle variations in pitch that also communicate meaning is processed in the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rare set of research participants &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandrasekaran partnered with Dr. Taylor Abel, chief of pediatric neurosurgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine to study auditory information processing in 11 adolescent patients who were receiving neurosurgery treatment for severe epilepsy. They all had electrodes implanted deep in the cortex of the brain that is critical for key language function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, communication and linguistics research rely on non-invasive recordings from the surface of the skin, which makes it accessible but not very precise,” Abel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A collaboration between neurosurgeon-scientists and neuroscientists, like ours, allowed us to collect high-quality recordings of brain activity that would not have been possible otherwise, and learn about the mechanisms of brain processing in a completely new way.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore how the brain deciphers the melody of speech, researchers worked with the rare group of patients who had electrodes implanted in their brains as part of epilepsy treatment. While these patients actively listened to an audiobook recording of “Alice in Wonderland,” scientists tracked activity in multiple brain regions in real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What researchers found &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the intracerebral recordings from the electrodes deep in the patient’s brain, researchers noted the Heschl’s gyrus section processed subtle changes in voice pitch — not just as sound, but as meaningful linguistic units. The brain encoded pitch accents separately from the sounds that make up words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study challenges the long-standing assumptions how and where the brain picks up on the natural melody in speech — those subtle pitch changes that help convey meaning and intent,” said G. Nike Gnanataja of UW-Madison’s Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and co-first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though these pitch patterns vary each time we speak, our brains create stable representations to understand them.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gnanataja says the research also revealed that the hidden layer of meaning carried by prosodic contours — the rise and fall of speech — is encoded much earlier in auditory processing than previously thought.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar research was conducted in non-human primates, but researchers found those brains lacked this abstraction, despite processing the same acoustic cues.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why it matters &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By unlocking the hidden layer of speech, Chandrasekaran and his team discovered how the brain processes pitch accents, revealing profound implications for various fields.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could transform speech rehabilitation, AI-powered voice assistants, and our understanding of what makes human communication unique,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding early prosodic processing could lead to new interventions for speech and language disorders, such as autism, dysprosody in patients who have had a stroke, and language-based learning differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the unique role of linguistic experience in human communication, as non-human primates lack the ability to process pitch accents as abstract categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these findings could significantly enhance AI-driven voice recognition systems by enabling them to better handle prosody, bringing natural language processing closer to mimicking human speech perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research is supported by NIH grant 5R01DC13315-11 awarded by the National Institute of Health and is a product of an ongoing research project titled “Cortical contributions to frequency-following response generation and modulation,” co-principal investigators Bharath Chandrasekaran, Taylor Abel, Srivatsun Sadagopan, Tobias Teichert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was also supported by NIH grant R21DC019217-01A1 awarded to Taylor Abel; and the Vice-Chancellors Research and Graduate Education, and College of Letters and Sciences UW Madison Funds to G.

In the non-human primate, pitch accents were not abstractly encoded, despite robust spectrotemporal processing, highlighting the role of experience in shaping abstract representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings emphasize a key role for the HG in early prosodic abstraction and advance our understanding of human speech processing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 21:42:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE5GM0w3RG1iZzdnYjhVMXNmWkdidjlQMUFTT2NlQk9kNzNDQjFjcThIYjc1VGxpenRPVUM4SnVJeFh1bnFLRXFwYVRaOWZmZk1qbWdibFVtZWE0ekQ2SnJKN3ZCUWxySjNx</guid></item><item><title>Measles cases reported in Philadelphia area and in Texas traveler - University of Minnesota Twin Cities</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxQWjhETnZiWDZUMDZENk84eXUxcHE2Y0dlQmd2d2h5eWc2SHlDaWFVUkJMWTREd19aT085VUMxRng0UTg1QmZuSDRjVmpNZjdGczhuTXFTWVdVSTMwWTZtQWFNS00wODV1M2l1N2hEa1lMSXBiMUJFdTBjMzhIMEVvY193SWRkZGNEbWNMUDB0RURENkM4WDZiRUR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-025-10481-w"&gt;review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found a high level of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria isolated from cancer patients, researchers reported late last week in &lt;em&gt;BMC Infectious Diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cancer patients are known to be at increased risk of infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens, there has been no systematic review of the global prevalence of AMR in the common pathogenic bacteria known to cause infections in cancer patients. To address this gap in knowledge, researchers from the University of Ghana Medical School reviewed studies published from 2000 to 2024 on cancer patients with infections caused by &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Enterobacter&lt;/em&gt; spp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review identified 132 articles involving 49,638 cancer patients in 39 countries. Most studies (67%) reported AMR in multiple pathogens, while 33% reported resistance in single pathogens. For &lt;em&gt;E coli&lt;/em&gt;, resistance prevalence was highest for penicillins (81.8%), followed by cotrimoxazole (65.8%) and monobactams (61.6%). For &lt;em&gt;K pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, the highest prevalence of resistance was observed for penicillins (99.0%) and cotrimoxazole (70.9%), while &lt;em&gt;A baumannii&lt;/em&gt; had high resistance prevalence to multiple antimicrobial classes, including third-generation cephalosporins (84.1%), fourth-generation cephalosporins (80.8%), carbapenems (82.6%), fluoroquinolones (80.4%), beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors (79.2%), cotrimoxazole (75.8%), and aminoglycosides (64.1%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enterobacter&lt;/em&gt; spp and &lt;em&gt;E faecium&lt;/em&gt; showed high resistance prevalence to penicillins, at 91.8% and 90.6% respectively, while &lt;em&gt;P aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt; had a high prevalence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (49.4%), and&lt;em&gt; S aureus&lt;/em&gt; showed high prevalence to macrolides (55.6%) and methicillin (45.3%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Better infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship needed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors suggest possible underlying factors for high AMR levels among cancer patients include immunosuppression, prolonged antibiotic exposure, invasive medical devices, and intensive treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These procedures and treatments can weaken their immune system, increasing their susceptibility to infections," they wrote. "Moreover, the acquisition of resistant bacteria from healthcare settings is significant, considering that cancer patients spend a substantial amount of time in these facilities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pronounced resistance prevalence observed, especially among ESKAPE pathogens, underscores the urgent need to improve infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship in cancer care globally," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food allergies now affect approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-health-conditions/food-allergies/index.html#:~:text=Why%20it's%20an%20issue,department%20for%20food%20allergy%20reactions." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1 in 13 children&lt;/a&gt; in the US, representing an increase of 50% in the prevalence of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/19/health/drug-to-treat-severe-food-allergies-including-nuts-gets-fda-approval/"&gt;food allergies&lt;/a&gt; between 1997 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts attribute the rise to several factors, including a shift to more refined diets, vitamin D deficiencies due to a lack of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/health/4-common-medications-that-can-increase-skin-cancer-risk/"&gt;sun exposure&lt;/a&gt; and the “hygiene hypothesis” — which posits that our cleaner contemporary environment exposes children to fewer microbes, causing their immune system to overreact to certain foods. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pai.70035"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; performed in Sweden and published in the journal Pediatric Allergy and Immunology adds to a growing body of research that suggests one of the factors may be the delayed introduction of allergenic foods. &lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;At 18 months, 100 of the children in the study were diagnosed with a food allergy, the most common ones being cow’s milk and eggs.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the data of 2,060 babies and found that introducing them to a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/08/health/twins-tried-different-diets-for-12-weeks-one-had-more-energy/"&gt;diverse diet&lt;/a&gt; — categorized as consisting of 13 or 14 different foods — at 9 months of age was associated with a 45% decrease in the risk of food allergies by the time the infant reached 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the study suggests that the same protective effect does not seem to occur when implementing a diverse diet at an earlier age, such as 6 months. &lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;This association held strong even after adjusting for factors like family history of allergies, breastfeeding duration and the mother’s education levels — although the researchers noted that “children with a history of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/06/health/salt-may-increase-your-risk-for-dry-itchy-skin-by-22-study/"&gt;eczema&lt;/a&gt; may benefit the most from eating a diverse diet early in life for food allergy prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were obtained by asking parents to fill out a questionnaire that measured their infant’s diet diversity at 6 and 9 months based on how often they consumed 14 foods, including six that are common allergies: wheat, egg, fish, dairy, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt; (especially peanuts) and soy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At 18 months, 100 of the children in the study were diagnosed with a food allergy, the most common ones being cow’s milk (69 cases) and eggs (35 cases). &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While food allergies are predominantly genetic, this study indicates that a baby’s diet at 9 months could also have a significant impact on their likelihood of developing food allergies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Repeated exposure to foods in infancy is important both for tolerance development and maintenance,” the researchers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One could assume that frequent consumption of plant-based foods including fruit, vegetables, and legumes which are rich in fiber and vitamins are especially important for reducing food allergy risk, in line with existing guidelines,” they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings align with previous studies emphasizing the benefits of early introduction of allergenic foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, a &lt;a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2019.5780?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found that introducing peanut-containing foods to babies between 4 to 6 months of age was associated with a reduced risk of peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/health/introducing-peanuts-early-reduces-kids-allergy-risk-study/"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt; replicated those findings last year, finding that kids who ate peanuts as a paste or puree until age 5 were 71% less likely to develop a peanut allergy than those who didn’t have peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1555415523001708"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; “supports that the method and timing of food introduction can impact the likelihood of developing an allergy or sensitivity to the food.”&lt;/p&gt;

Scott Salinas&lt;/a&gt; weighed 254 pounds. He had terrible sleep apnea and acid reflux. “There were many nights where I wondered if I was going to live through the night. With the apnea I was suffocating, and with the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/best-foods-people-gerd-or-acid-reflux-t109070" target="_blank"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt; I would wake up choking on my own vomit,” he tells TODAY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;His wife, Tiffany, was worried. They had a 3-year-old daughter and a baby on the way. Tiffany’s birthday is in February, and she asked him if, instead of buying her a gift, he would talk to the team at &lt;a href="https://ultimateperformance.com/us/personal-trainer/los-angeles/?utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=scott.salinas&amp;amp;utm_id=scott.salinas&amp;amp;up_campaign=scott.salinas&amp;amp;up_campaign=referral_pr" target="_blank"&gt;Ultimate Performance Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; about how their program could help him lose weight and improve his health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I went, but to be honest, I was kind of flippant. I thought it would be good for my golf game,” he says. “My family is the most important thing in my life, but I wasn’t making them my priority.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He realized, though, that his weight was impacting his daughter. “She patted me on the belly and said, ‘I want a big belly. What do I have to do?’ I realized I wasn’t being the best parent I could be,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Salinas went all-in on his health: “One thing I know about my nature is that if I’m going to spend money and time on something, I’m going to take it seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By the end of 2024 he was 100 pounds lighter. His sleep problems have disappeared, and he &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/healthy-hacks-more-energy-t103019" target="_blank"&gt;has the energy&lt;/a&gt; to keep up with his daughter and the family’s newest addition, a 5-month-old girl.

Working with a trainer, you’re constantly being pushed a little bit more than you would push yourself,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He also &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/walking-workout-plan-daily-habit-rcna85433" target="_blank"&gt;started walking&lt;/a&gt; — a lot. “Walking uses energy but doesn’t leave you feeling starving 10 minutes later,” he says. He aimed for &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-many-steps-a-day-rcna52153" target="_blank"&gt;10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt; at first, and often would get closer to 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When he played golf, he’d walk 10,000 to 15,000 steps. Other days, after his kids went to bed, instead of watching TV he would put on a podcast and walk around his neighborhood from 9 p.m. to midnight. On a day his family moved into a new home, he hit his highest number ever — 45,000 steps, nearly covering the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-long-does-it-take-to-run-a-marathon-rcna117658" target="_blank"&gt;distance of a marathon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250221-01-c7314f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250221-01-c7314f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250221-01-c7314f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250221-01-c7314f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250221-01-c7314f.jpg" alt="Scott Salinas before and after."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt; Walking played a big role in Salinas' journey.

He was also drinking a lot of alcohol. “I stopped drinking. In my opinion, it’s very difficult to make a transformation like this when you’re drinking. Drinking equaled worse eating, and then when I was hungover I wanted greasy, carby foods,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He also followed the program closely. He set goals for fat, carbs, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-protein-snacks-rcna193742" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, calories and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-much-water-should-i-drink-rcna66483" target="_blank"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, tracked them in an app and photographed his food so his trainer could help him stay on track. “Part of it is understanding what my body wants. I’m not out gorging myself. I’m careful with what I’m eating and I’m seeing what’s happening,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He weighs himself regularly because he knows that when he doesn’t, he gains weight. “I have an app that shows my weight going back to 2010 or 2011. When I look at the times I lost weight, I was weighing myself regularly. Other times, there’s a four-month gap where I gained 25 pounds,” he says. “I need to stay tuned into the information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He wasn’t highly motivated at first, but he pushed through&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="pullquote pullquote--small" data-testid="pullquote-small"&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote__quote" data-testid="pullquote-quote"&gt; I don’t think you need high enthusiasm to start, and I don’t think you should wait for it, because it might never come. Just do it, like you do your taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote__attribution"&gt;&lt;cite class="pullquote__cite" data-testid="pullquote-attribution"&gt;H. Scott Salinas&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;span class="pullquote__quip" data-testid="pullquote-quip"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Salinas admits that he wasn’t super excited about beginning his journey. “My enthusiasm prior to starting this process was less than 4 out of 10. I don’t think you need high enthusiasm to start, and I don’t think you should wait for it, because it might never come. Just do it, like you do your taxes — most people find a way to get them done. It’s OK to not have that much enthusiasm,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Salinas saw his enthusiasm grow as the pounds came off and his health improved. He lost 20 pounds in three weeks, but he figured a lot of that must be water weight. Still, Tiffany noticed that his &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/could-sleep-doctor-help-solve-your-sleep-problems-t211732" target="_blank"&gt;sleep apnea improved&lt;/a&gt;. And soon after, he was down 40 pounds. “I thought, ‘There’s got to be some fat in there.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He also worked toward &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/tmrw/what-smart-goal-how-system-could-help-you-stay-task-t205317" target="_blank"&gt;small, manageable goals&lt;/a&gt;, since aiming to lose 100 pounds felt too daunting. “I looked at the data, and I often set a goal of 80% of that rate. I almost always beat it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For example, he could see he was losing about four pounds a week. So, he would set a goal to lose six pounds in two weeks, rather than aiming for eight. Meeting his targets helped keep him motivated and enthusiastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250224-03-8df95f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250224-03-8df95f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250224-03-8df95f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250224-03-8df95f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/pregnant-wife-asks-husband-go-to-gym-zz-250224-03-8df95f.jpg" alt="Salinas says feeing more in control and having a greater emotional bandwidth was an unexpected side effect of his weight loss."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Salinas says feeing more in control and having a greater emotional bandwidth was an unexpected side effect of his weight loss.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Scott Salinas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He expects plateaus in weight loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You have to be prepared for a non-linear experience. When you’re &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/how-to-break-weight-loss-plateau-walking-rcna92618" target="_blank"&gt;plateauing&lt;/a&gt;, you’re actually making gains,” he says. He recalls six days in a row when he weighed 184 pounds. “I would say to myself, ‘Dude, good job. You didn’t gain weight. Remember four months ago, when you gained weight every day?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He also recognized that the more weight he lost, the slower the pounds would come off. “There’s just less to lose. You have to look at it from a percentage of body fat and a percentage of weight loss,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His whole life has changed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Salinas ranks his &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/my-weight-loss-journey" target="_blank"&gt;weight-loss journey&lt;/a&gt; as one of the top events of his life, along with his marriage and the births of his children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The extent of the psychological change is remarkable, in terms of how I feel as a human being. I have a different disposition. I always considered myself fairly even keeled, but this is different. There’s an effect that being healthier has on your mind. When life throws you curveballs, they’re more manageable. It’s not the end of the world. I have more emotional bandwidth. It’s not something I had anticipated,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He’s found that paying attention to his choices in one area &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/non-scale-victories-nsv-rcna98828" target="_blank"&gt;has carried over to other parts of his life&lt;/a&gt;. “I started looking at my life a little differently instead of being on autopilot. Maybe I’m not always in control, but I have some say. I wasn’t thinking this way when I was 100 pounds overweight, but that’s the real, true benefit. Having that agency is invigorating,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He’s using this year to learn how to maintain his gains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Salinas is turning his attention from weight loss to &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/weight-loss-maintenance-long-term-tips-rcna19358" target="_blank"&gt;maintaining his weight&lt;/a&gt; and his health: “Maintenance is about being present and paying attention to the signs your body is giving you. I turn 50 in December. I look at this next year as a lifestyle year.

						&lt;p&gt;A Dare County resident had
to sacrifice their backyard chickens after the birds tested positive for the
bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said Monday that wild birds
that carry the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, known commonly as bird
flu, can infect domesticated birds. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This type of HPAI virus is
considered a low risk to people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control. However, it is highly contagious to other birds. The virus is also not
considered a food safety threat and infected birds do not enter the food
supply. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It is likely that HPAI remains in our
resident wild bird population and in migratory waterfowl, so reports of
positive backyard flocks will likely happen on occasion,” said Dr. Mike Martin,
state veterinarian. “I encourage our commercial and backyard flock owners to
continue to follow strict biosecurity measures and if your flock is
experiencing a sudden higher-than-normal mortality rate, report it right away
to your local veterinarian or to the N.C. Department of Agriculture Veterinary
Division at 919-707-3250.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state said the flock of chickens
that tested positive for bird was euthanized to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In February, a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/bird-flu-detected-wake-county-owl-2025/"&gt;great horned owl tested positive for bird flu in Wake County&lt;/a&gt;, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission confirmed the case and said one hawk and multiple geese were found dead in the same area. It marked the first case of bird flu detected in Wake County since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In January, the state said bird flu
was found in two commercial turkey operations in Sampson County and a layer
operation in Hyde County. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/dare-county-first-bird-flu-case-backyard-flock-march-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/dare-county-first-bird-flu-case-backyard-flock-march-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

a low risk to people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
However, it is highly contagious to other birds. The virus is also not
considered a food safety threat and infected birds do not enter the food
supply. &lt;/p&gt;

As of late February, more than 166 million birds had been slaughtered
nationwide to limit the virus' spread when cases are found. Most were
egg-laying chickens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — A chickenpox outbreak has been &lt;a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/student-affairs/story/chickenpox-outbreak-reported-penn-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;reported at Penn State University.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University Health Services confirmed three cases of the virus at the University Park campus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say students and staff who were in Mifflin Hall between February 17 and February 24 or in the Thomas Building on February 20 between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have received two doses of the varicella vaccine or have had the disease are considered protected. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically develop within 10 to 21 days of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis is a disease that results when the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain and spinal cord. It affects &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000007035"&gt;nearly one million people in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and over &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458520970841"&gt;2.8 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. While genetics play a role in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/acn3.50862"&gt;environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; such as diet, infectious disease and gut health are major contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The environment plays a key role in determining who develops multiple sclerosis, and this is evident from twin studies. Among identical twins who share 100% of their genes, one twin has a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejm198612253152603"&gt;roughly 25% chance&lt;/a&gt; of developing MS if the other twin has the disease. For fraternal twins who share 50% of their genes, this rate drops to around 2%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long suspected that gut bacteria may influence a person’s risk of developing multiple sclerosis. But studies so far have had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2387794"&gt;inconsistent findings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address these inconsistencies, my colleagues and I used what researchers call a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/podcasts/neuro-pathways/bedside-to-bench-to-bedside-the-keys-to-successful-collaboration-in-neuroscience-research"&gt;bedside-to-bench-to-bedside&lt;/a&gt; approach: starting with samples from patients with multiple sclerosis, conducting lab experiments on these samples, then confirming our findings in patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our newly published research, we found that the ratio of two bacteria in the gut can &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413953122"&gt;predict multiple sclerosis severity&lt;/a&gt; in patients, highlighting the importance of the microbiome and gut health in this disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; is commonly found in the human gut microbiome.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13410"&gt;Zhang et al/Microbial Biotechnology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bedside to bench&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we analyzed the chemical and bacterial gut composition of patients with multiple sclerosis, confirming that they had gut inflammation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2387794"&gt;different types of gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; compared with people without multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we showed that a group of bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt; was more common in multiple sclerosis patients, while &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114519000680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt;, a bacterial species&lt;/a&gt; consistently linked to a healthy gut, was found in lower amounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a separate experiment in mice, we observed that the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413953122"&gt;balance between two gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt;, was critical in distinguishing mice with or without multiple sclerosis-like disease. Mice with multiple sclerosis-like symptoms had increased levels of &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; and decreased levels of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; in their stool or gut lining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bench to bedside&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, we treated mice with antibiotics to remove all their gut bacteria. Then, we gave either &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt;, which was higher in multiple sclerosis patients; &lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt;, which was more common in healthy patients; or a control bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Phocaeicola&lt;/em&gt;, which is found in patients with and without multiple sclerosis. We found that mice with &lt;em&gt;Blautia&lt;/em&gt; developed more gut inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413953122"&gt;worse multiple sclerosis-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before symptoms appeared, these mice had low levels of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and high levels of &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt;. This suggested that an imbalance between these two bacteria might not just be a sign of disease, but could actually &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2413953122"&gt;predict how severe&lt;/a&gt; it will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then examined whether this same imbalance appeared in people. We measured the ratio of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium adolescentis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in samples from multiple sclerosis patients in Iowa and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.08.021"&gt;participants in a study&lt;/a&gt; spanning the U.S., Latin America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our findings were consistent: Patients with multiple sclerosis had a lower ratio of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt;. This imbalance was not only linked to having multiple sclerosis but also with worse disability, making it a stronger predictor of disease severity than any single type of bacteria alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/652204/original/file-20250228-32-hj7pci.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; both produces and consumes mucin, a glycoprotein that protects the gut lining.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/92803392@N02/9511080418"&gt;Paola Mattarelli and Monica Modesto/Katz Lab via Flickr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-NC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How ‘good’ bacteria can become harmful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting findings from our study was that normally beneficial bacteria can turn harmful in multiple sclerosis. &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; is usually considered a helpful bacterium, but it became problematic in patients with multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previous study in mice showed a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2022.2127446"&gt;similar pattern&lt;/a&gt;: Mice with severe disease had a lower &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-to-&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; ratio. In that study, mice fed a diet rich in phytoestrogens – chemicals structurally similar to human estrogen that need to be broken down by bacteria for beneficial health effects – developed milder disease than those on a diet without phytoestrogens. Previously we have shown that people with multiple sclerosis lack gut bacteria that can metabolize phytoestrogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the precise mechanisms behind the link between the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-to- &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; ratio and multiple sclerosis is unknown, researchers have a theory. Both types of bacteria consume &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/slime-is-all-around-and-inside-you-new-research-on-its-origins-offers-insight-into-genetic-evolution-189278"&gt;mucin, a substance&lt;/a&gt; that protects the gut lining. However, &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; both &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11819-z"&gt;eats and produces mucin&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; only consumes it. When &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; levels drop, such as during inflammation, &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; overconsumes mucin and weakens the gut lining. This process can trigger more inflammation and potentially contribute to the progression of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our finding that the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;-to-&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/em&gt; ratio may be a key marker for multiple sclerosis severity could help improve diagnosis and treatment. It also highlights how losing beneficial gut bacteria can allow other gut bacteria to become harmful, though it is unclear whether changing levels of certain microbes can affect multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While more research can help clarify the link between the gut microbiome and multiple sclerosis, these findings offer a promising new direction for understanding and treating this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

This sickness has killed over 60 people and sickened more than a thousand, and it is occurring at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Uganda, as well as increasing political violence within the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Experts say that Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has stymied the response to this unidentified disease, delaying further investigations and containment efforts of additional disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Medical staff along the Uganda–DRC border have been terminated. Soldiers are everywhere. The laboratory built to deal with zoonotic diseases with US funding is empty,” says Tim Allen, a London School of Economics professor and tropical-disease-control expert on the ground at the border of Uganda and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nidhi Bouri, the former deputy assistant administrator for global health at USAID during the Joe Biden administration who previously led disease preparedness and response efforts, says the aid cuts have created a gap in the on-the-ground response. “We don’t have the in-country presence,” she says. USAID previously provided key infrastructure and support for disease surveillance and prevention; it worked in tandem with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on complementary tasks, Bouri says. “Once a pathogen is identified, USAID was able to, historically, identify rapid ways to mitigate further spread.” By abruptly gutting USAID, the Donald Trump administration has created a vacuum that other agencies will struggle to completely fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The US State Department did not respond to requests for comment. “CDC is monitoring the situation closely and engaging with DRC officials on what support the agency can offer,” says Centers for Disease Control spokesperson Melissa Dibble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the disease in the DRC is still officially unidentified, there are some conflicting theories emerging about its cause. The World Health Organization &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/"}' href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now suspects&lt;/a&gt; that the unidentified illness could in fact be a mass-poisoning incident rather than a virus, with contaminated water as a likely source. Or, if it is a virus, it may not be novel at all; last year in the DRC, an outbreak of an unknown illness was discovered to be respiratory infections &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON547"&gt;combined with malaria&lt;/a&gt;. Local health officials, including experts at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q94_f039QKM"&gt;hypothesize&lt;/a&gt; that this may be the case again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2024, the United States Congress &lt;a data-offer-url="https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf"}' href="https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appropriated&lt;/a&gt; $795 million for malaria control, most of which was intended to serve sub-Saharan Africa, which weathers the bulk of global malaria infections.

analyzed 226 recent comatose patients, observing a third displayed the unique bursts - a phenomenon scientists call 'sleep spindles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain circuits that&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14442711/The-five-clues-afterlife-really-DOES-exist.html"&gt; are fundamental for consciousness&lt;/a&gt; are also key to how we sleep, the Columbia team explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreover, scientists said comatose patients with this type of 'hidden consciousness' showed signs they were already on the road to recovery from their brain injuries and many dealt with fewer disabilities later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those displaying sleep spindles, 76 percent showed some level of consciousness before leaving the hospital and over 40 percent recovered some of their neurological function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Jan Claassen, an associate professor of neurology, said that this discovery provides new hope for families with critically injured loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at an exciting crossroad in neurocritical care where we know that many patients appear to be unconscious, but some are recovering without our knowledge,' said Claassen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're starting to lift the lid a little bit and find some signs of recovery as it's happening,' the lead study author continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists have discovered unique signals in the sleep patterns of comatose patients, revealing that they have a 'hidden' level of consciousness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The connection between certain brain circuits and sleep is&lt;span&gt; important for explaining a condition called cognitive motor dissociation, where unconscious patients still show evidence of consciousness during brain scans but have no detectable ability to respond to outside stimuli - like someone talking to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, scientists have mainly focused on EEG recordings to tell if comatose patients were still conscious in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These recordings test to detect abnormalities in brain waves, based on how well the person undergoing the EEG responds to a doctor's instructions, such as opening and closing their hand. However, Claassen noted that these recordings can lead to false-negative results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, the Columbia team shifted their focus to tracking the activity present in brain wave patterns during normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The electrical activity during sleep looks relatively chaotic, and then occasionally in some patients, these very organized, fast frequencies appear,' Claassen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The associate professor noted that these unique bursts in the middle of all that chaos are the sleep spindles displaying hidden consciousness inside the comatose mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Spindles happen normally during sleep and they're showing some level of organization in the brain, suggesting circuits between the thalamus and cortex needed for consciousness are intact,' Claassen detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thalamus acts like your brain's information relay station, while the cortex contributes to higher brain functions like memory, thinking, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The brain activity are sleep spindles and researchers said it shows unconscious patients can still hear and understand what is happing around them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22652-thalamus"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, all of the information coming in from your body's senses (except smell) has to be processed by the thalamus before it's sent to the brain's cortex for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the patients in Claassen's study, the spindles show that they're still hearing people talk and feel them squeeze their hand, and those sensations are still traveling to the brain's cortex where the mind reacts to what's happening - even if people sitting next to them can't see a noticeable reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, researchers examined the overnight EEG recordings of 226 comatose patients. This group also underwent more complex testing for cognitive motor dissociation. The team noted that all of these injuries were recent and their findings likely don't apply to those with long-term disorders causing unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03578-x"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; focused specifically on sleep among patients in a coma after a recent brain injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results revealed that 87 patients displayed signs of both sleep spindles and cognitive motor dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with clear signs of the sleep spindles in their brain waves were significantly more likely to regain consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also more likely recover from their severe brain injury with only minor neurological deficits or a moderate disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, just 19 of the 139 comatose patients who did not experience sleep spindles or cognitive motor dissociation regained any level of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see these spindles as a way to direct more sophisticated testing to the patients most likely to benefit,' Claassen said. 'The techniques are not ready for use in clinical practice yet, but this is something that we're actively working on right now.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lead study author added their study doesn't prove that inducing sleep spindles could help brain injury patients regain consciousness, but there are signs that moving these patients to areas which promote better sleep could improve their chances of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you think about the ICU environment, it is rather disruptive for a good night's sleep. There is noise everywhere, alarms going off, clinicians touching them, 24/7. This is all for a good reason, but it's hard to sleep in that environment,' Claassen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 19:17:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNMXpDWi1mTDNWUlRvWVBDc0RkX2hKUTAzanQwQkJYc010dmJIa0J4Y25maUtDSzFOb0x6eWZQbndDNGJ5eDNuUHhRX3pYYlVGY0pPd0VZek9mUnF4ekFVbGFoajFvRnhLSEJPb2Qtb3RTTHdHSzhza19RVGJLUVJ0cXNnV3JzUTd6R1lKTkxYTjQ3VFFLMnA1WUIyWWpFZXNGc25qa2JDZ9IBrAFBVV95cUxNMmlJS1A2c1lvUDA1OHV1ZlgwTm5JUW9zZzJoczdCYkV1ZDdxa0NpRFlFZGJtTlZVRURPcmFuUHF3cFJTb3VkSExWdkEtaGg4WFdDdGpXLTRERWVkR3FULVdISURLWFZVYzFWUUxzSjd1alR0cXpiWkw2T0hoZTlic2VFelo3QTc2TTdRdFdZelZnYS1pYWNOTVA3Tk9NZ0pkR2cxMHdaVnlVM1M0</guid></item><item><title>Woman notices unusual symptom after a manicure... it saved her life - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQYUh4dGtzeG5GMkZkS0pQaHZGMHBZM3YyWTR1LXRqVTJBTzhZcnV2LVYyaFdCQjRnSW10bndGWUJkLUpnUmxya1Rjc2xQak1qVmdUQ1ZzRXZ3c3Vna011aXdtMUZUNC0wbElVN1p3MFU2UWVFUTNUVV9mSWZQb1ZUNUc5czVBTFB3elE3VDE1aFNlbGdEUFZ6OFF4VjNRTGkycEJKUVZB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9ZQ0I2bVFJcnBDLU04YmNiZGtsYUtjakV3U0ZQTHNMNW13ZjdPdHJ3a3VjeXc2cXdZNl9ST2szOUFOWldhT1cyQ1VXLXFWN2hNS2w1UVYxd3hUM1lKbktkaTJ1bHlZVHJyNFF0UlVIeVZZa1JUSTZJdTFBcTd1S0xUSEFWM3NDd0JQZXNoOFdYc3d5Y3FLdnpMTm5qYVlKUktCNXhQWXBDQ0NuQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-2795e580-f84d-11ef-9b24-a7fd1b4ae0a6"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; mother-of-two made a life-saving discovery after she noticed black lines on her thumb while at a nail appointment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Michelle Tagliamonte, 58, first noticed the faint lines running across her right thumb in September 2024 shortly before getting monthly  manicure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health coach and nutrition educator recalled: 'The first time I noticed it [the mark] was in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I usually get my nails done every four weeks so I don't know how long it has been there but my nails grow pretty quickly because I have really good nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It could have been in there for six months, it could have been in there for longer, I have no idea. I took some photos of the lines and then I decided to get my nails done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she expected the marks would grow out by her next manicure appointment in October 2024, she was surprised to see them become more prominent and&lt;span&gt; decided to get it checked as a precautionary measure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a trip to her dermatologist and a biopsy, the health coach was diagnosed with melanoma in her finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Michelle Tagliamonte, 58, discovered she had stage zero melanoma in her right thumb after she noticed black lines on her thumb while at a nail appointment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Tagliamonte was diagnosed with stage zero melanoma, also referred to as melanoma in situ. This stage is when the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-2ce083a0-f853-11ef-9b24-a7fd1b4ae0a6" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells are contained just to the epidermis - the very outer layer of the skin - and have not yet moved into the deeper layers of skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stage zero melanoma, diagnosed in about 89,000 people in 2023, is considered a non-invasive cancer, meaning it has spread to other tissues.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a very high survival rate - 98 percent - the cancerous area is removed surgically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, treatments such as  chemotherapy are not required, but if not cured but surgery, some doctors may suggest undergoing radiation therapy to kill the cancerous cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On January 17, Tagliamonte underwent a four-hour operation during which her right thumbnail was removed and a plastic surgeon took a skin graft from the bottom of her thumb to place over the bone and tendon where her missing nail now left them exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was left with a large incision and stitches running down the side of her hand following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She first noticed the faint lines running across her right thumb in September 2024. Images show her thumb bloodied with a large incision and stitches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On January 17, Tagliamonte underwent a four-hour operation to remove the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: '&lt;span&gt;What the dermatologist was seeing was discoloration at the base of my thumb nail and whatever was causing this black line in my nail was coming from inside the growth plate down from inside my nail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The melanoma was in the growth plate [in my thumb] down to my first knuckle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is where they had to cut out and they had to create a skin graft so when they had to dig out the melanoma, the bone and the tendon was exposed so they had to put some flesh back in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The skin graft was pretty invasive. I will never have a thumb nail ever again but if I had let it go, I might have lost the tip of my thumb or worse so I am very grateful and it is healing well.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She will now be left without a right thumbnail for life but says there is no permanent nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Tagliamonte said: 'I was more worried about what they were going to have to do to get rid of it and the surgery itself. This was scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Since surgery], there is no permanent nerve damage. I have a scar that runs down my thumb and the skin is still healing and new skin is forming under the skin graft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She will now be left without a right thumbnail for life  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She has since spent her time healing and is now urging others to trust their own intuition and get themselves checked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm right-handed so the worst part was not being able to use this hand. For the first couple of weeks I couldn't button my own pants or put on my own bra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since spent her time healing and is now urging others to trust their own intuition and get themselves checked if they notice any changes in their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am very grateful that I caught it at stage zero and it was localized. I think it's just a matter of being diligent to get myself checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would just say don't take anything for granted. I would definitely say that if you see something that is odd or different, listen to your own intuition and get it checked out,' she gratefully said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have warned of the dangers of the use of UV light used to seal some nail polish during professional manicures, saying it can potentially increase the risk of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some nail lamps are called 'UV' lamps and some are called LED lamps, both emit UV radiation that produce UVA rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive exposure to UV rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of tumors, including melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While both UVA and UVB rays contribute to skin cancer, with UVB being more directly linked to sunburn while UVA can penetrate deeper into the skin and contribute to long-term damage and aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 19:11:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQYUh4dGtzeG5GMkZkS0pQaHZGMHBZM3YyWTR1LXRqVTJBTzhZcnV2LVYyaFdCQjRnSW10bndGWUJkLUpnUmxya1Rjc2xQak1qVmdUQ1ZzRXZ3c3Vna011aXdtMUZUNC0wbElVN1p3MFU2UWVFUTNUVV9mSWZQb1ZUNUc5czVBTFB3elE3VDE1aFNlbGdEUFZ6OFF4VjNRTGkycEJKUVZB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9ZQ0I2bVFJcnBDLU04YmNiZGtsYUtjakV3U0ZQTHNMNW13ZjdPdHJ3a3VjeXc2cXdZNl9ST2szOUFOWldhT1cyQ1VXLXFWN2hNS2w1UVYxd3hUM1lKbktkaTJ1bHlZVHJyNFF0UlVIeVZZa1JUSTZJdTFBcTd1S0xUSEFWM3NDd0JQZXNoOFdYc3d5Y3FLdnpMTm5qYVlKUktCNXhQWXBDQ0NuQQ</guid></item><item><title>75 Extremely Rare Mind-Blowing Pictures I Found Last Month That Might Just Completely And Totally Change Your Perspective On The World - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTFA2WmtpM2JPaXNXemZRZV9FTzdQX3ByZmFSY2cwcDVrdnE5SzNybTlpVks0eFotYkVEYUdKZ2NqV21GanZDQkdWQ21qOVBzNmVZbnhZVVc0UmVzdFM3cnhnWWF4SU1UUWFKRFpGMkhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz__description

The &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2201327119" target="_blank"&gt;entire field of Mendelian genetics&lt;/a&gt; was born from experiments crossbreeding peas to learn about gene inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3PANSPR3INA7LNJRQW57RYXJLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For instance, have you ever found it odd that an eggplant, that large deep-purple blob, was named for an egg? It was selectively bred this way.

You see, &lt;strong&gt;your gut is filled with trillions of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes that feed on the food you put in your body. If they’re fed well, that can be a boon for your overall health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gut microbiome is crucial for overall well-being due to several functions like the development of the immune system, human metabolism and even cognitive function,” says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alma Simmons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alma Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, LD, CDCES, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. “One of the most important functions of the microbiota is to protect the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens and potentially harmful microorganisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not every food is good for your gut and the microbes that live within it. “Gas, bloating, cramping, diarrhea and constipation are no fun,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/anish-sheth" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anish A.

If you’re looking for a simple nutritious routine that won’t take up too much of your time, look no further. In this seven-day healthy-eating meal plan for beginners, we map out a high-fiber, high-protein routine that prioritizes quick and easy recipes. Each meal has 30 minutes or less of active cooking time and a maximum of three steps. You’ll also find meal-prep tips throughout and three different calorie levels to choose from. Let’s get started!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ll find quick and easy recipes with simple ingredients in this plan because healthy eating doesn’t have to be time-consuming. Every recipe is ready in three steps or less and has 30 minutes or less of active cooking time. Each day provides an average of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;89 grams of protein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044305/best-high-fiber-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;32 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt;. These two nutrients provide staying power, which helps keep us full and satiated between meals. We include a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and protein sources to provide variety and support your health. Sodium is limited to a max of 2,300 milligrams per day, as recommended by the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We set this meal plan at 1,800 calories per day and included modifications for 1,500 and 2,000 calories per day. While we previously included meal plans and modifications for 1,200 calories, we no longer do. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting your calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! If there’s a meal you don’t like, you can repeat a meal in this plan or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18258/cooking-methods-styles/quick-easy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quick and easy recipes&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration. We aimed for at least 70 grams of protein, 30 grams of fiber and a max of 2,300 milligrams per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, feel free to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day if that’s easier for your routine. The breakfasts range from 368 to 584 calories, while the lunches span 406 to 576 calories. A simple swap should work for most, but you may want to adjust a snack or two if you’re closely monitoring calories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and how to enjoy your morning brew safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Antidepressants &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antidepressants already come with a long list of side effects, and some drugs can make it harder to safely consume coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jennifer Bourgeois, pharmacist and health expert at &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.singlecare.com/"&gt;SingleCare&lt;/a&gt;, warned: 'Caffeine can interact with these medications, potentially causing dangerous increases in blood pressure.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because older classes of antidepressants, such as tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), prevent the body from properly metabolizing caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, caffeine is filtered out through the kidneys as urine, but these drugs interrupt the process, leaving caffeine lingering in the body longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time this can cause a sustained high heart rate and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr HaVy Ngo-Hamilton, clinical consultant at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzrx.com/"&gt;BuzzRx&lt;/a&gt; and pharmacist at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-f78ac410-4b53-11ef-85b9-85128011d0f7"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; Medical Center, added that&lt;span&gt; drugs like fluvoxamine, p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;henelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate) were the worst offenders. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC estimated that one in 10 Americans over the age of 12 take antidepressants, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5596531/Tens-millions-Americans-struggle-quit-antidepressants-extreme-lengths-quit.html" class=""&gt;adding up to around 37 million people&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts said there are no known interactions between caffeine and newer so-called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Zoloft, Lexapro, and Prozac.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;OTC cold and allergy medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that nearly three in four US adults use over-the-counter cold and allergy meds to tackle symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of these contain the stimulant pseudoephedrine, which narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages to reduce swelling and congestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, by doing this, pseudoephedrine stimulates cells in the brain responsible for the 'fight or flight' response that keeps us safe when we are under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton warned that drinking coffee alongside these meds can exacerbate symptoms and make you feel jittery and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She pointed to over-the-counter drugs such as Sudafed and Mucinex as popular products with pseudoephedrine, and recommended taking these medications two hours before or four hours after a cup of coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Diabetes medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drinking sugary coffee with insulin could lead to blood sugar spikes, pharmacists warned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in 10 Americans take insulin to manage their diabetes. And while insulin does not directly interact with caffeine, it can still clash with your morning coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's more like, when you drink coffee, it increases your blood sugar, especially if there's cream and sugar in it too,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your blood sugar will spike, and that is making your medication less effective.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, drinking anything with caffeine can increase insulin and blood sugar levels, according to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/27/8/2047/23381/Caffeine-Impairs-Glucose-Metabolism-in-Type-2"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from the American Diabetes Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to insulin, Dr Ngo-Hamilton said people should also be mindful of the blood sugar drug metformin, which is taken by over 20 million Americans, according to the latest available data from 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommended keeping track of your blood sugar to determine if you should drink coffee with your medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics are prescribed for a wide variety of infections, with the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-979a8d90-4b50-11ef-92e4-174ea717279c"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimating that more than230 million such prescriptions were written in 2022 alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, these drugs can inhibit the metabolism of caffeine, leading to increased caffeine levels in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bourgeois specifically pointed to ciprofloxacin, also known as Cipro, which is typically used for bacterial infections such as UTIs and bladder infections, infectious diarrhea, and sinus infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As with cold and allergy meds, 'this antibiotic can inhibit the metabolism of caffeine, leading to increased caffeine levels in the blood,' she warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And just like with OTC meds, taking this drug with coffee could lead to a racing heart and feeling jittery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Blood thinners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Warfarin is the oldest and most popular blood thinner in America. However, taking it with coffee could lead to excessive bleeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A survey by the National Blood Clot Alliance suggested that eight million Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14185895/blood-clot-drug-ticagrelor-brilinta-death-strokes-heart-attack.html"&gt;take blood thinners, which are used to prevent blood clots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warfarin is both the oldest and most common, accounting for about a quarter of US blood thinner prescriptions, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton said caffeine can inhibit the breakdown of blood thinners, leading to more of the drug lingering in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is particularly dangerous because having too much of the drug could result in excessive bleeding, even from minor injuries like a paper cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For warfarin specifically, Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommends waiting 'at least six to eight hours' after taking the medication to have some coffee since there is 'a very significant drug interaction between warfarin and caffeine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newer blood thinners like Eliuis should not cause the these interactions, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Blood pressure medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy estimated that 117 million prescriptions for beta blockers have been doled out to 26 million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are meant to lower blood pressure and block the effects of the hormone epinephrine, or adrenaline. This helps improve blood flow and lower heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Beta blockers work to reduce your heart rate so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But then when you drink coffee, or any caffeinated beverages, it increases your heart rate and ultimately increases your blood pressure. This is not a direct drug interaction, but it's more like counteracting the beta blocker.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She suggested taking these medications two hours before or four hours after a cup of coffee or other caffeinated drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Thyroid medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levothyroxine, which is designed to treat an underactive thyroid - hypothyroidism - is one of America's most prescribed drugs, totaling 23 million prescriptions per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Ngo-Hamilton cautioned that taking these drugs with any type of food or water - coffee included - can reduce the amount of medication absorbed by the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7397437/"&gt;review from 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that caffeine reduced this absorption rate by as much as 50 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr William Franklin, founder and medical director of &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.victorymed.com/"&gt;Victory Medical&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, told the Daily Mail that people with levothyroxine prescriptions should take the drug 'on an empty stomach with water and wait 30 to 60 minutes before having caffeine'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Alzheimer's medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts estimated that one in 10 US adults over the age of 65 have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medications to treat symptoms, called cholinesterase inhibitors, prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine - a chemical that helps with memory formation and thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking these drugs with coffee tightens the blood-brain barrier, making it more difficult for the medication to reach the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultimately, it reduces the effectiveness,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She pointed to Donepezil and Rivastigmine as the most likely culprits to cause this effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also noted that someone on these drugs should take them two hours before or four hours after coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Osteoporosis medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taking osteoporosis drugs like risendronate and ibandronate with coffee could increase the risk of fractures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Osteoporosis is where bones become weak or brittle over time, causing even minor stressors like coughing to fracture them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimated that 10million Americans aged over 50 live with the condition and take medications like risendronate and ibandronate to slow bone breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as with thyroid medications, taking these drugs with coffee can stop them being properly absorbed by the body, making them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommended waiting about two hours after taking the medication to drink coffee or eat food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Asthma medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the 25 million Americans living with asthma rely on bronchodilators, a class of prescription medications that relax and widen the airways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, mixing bronchodilators such as aminophylline and theophylline with coffee could exacerbate the side effects of these drugs - like irritability and restlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're new on the medication, wait and see how you're doing on the medication first before you start drinking coffee because it can worsen the side effects,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you do still want to drink coffee, she suggested taking these medications four hours before or after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;ADHD medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Close to one in 10 Americans under the age of 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10764003/Adult-ADHD-sufferers-10-likely-employed-prescription-medication.html"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, and about 41million prescriptions have been doled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drugs help regulate neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine to improve focus, attention and impulse control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking drugs such as Adderall and Ritalin with coffee could make them less effective and lead to increased hyperactivity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Both ADHD medications and caffeine are stimulants.

But either way, if RFK Jr.’s statement leads to more vaccinations, it’s a win. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RFK Jr.’s new op-ed is a promising change in public health messaging, but doesn’t erase his decades of vaccine hesitancy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement is a huge shift from RFK Jr.’s messaging as recently as &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-dismisses-measles-outbreak_n_67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="last week at a Cabinet meeting" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;last week at a Cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt;, when he seemed to downplay the severity and called the measles outbreak “normal,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;said both Meade and Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, “He either didn’t know or was purposely manipulating the situation ... and to have the leader of our health care system not either know what is the reality or who is actively lying about it is concerning ― and not just concerning, it’s terrifying,” said Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new messaging, while promising, didn’t come fast enough, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most of us in the health care and public health space, this complete 180 in his messaging feels like a weak attempt to rescue a situation that has already spiraled out of control,” added Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The time for this messaging was when the outbreak began. The time for this messaging was on the day we lost a child to this vaccine-preventable disease rather than weak arguments that this current measles outbreak is normal. The time for this messaging was before the Children’s Health Defense tried to push ‘natural immunity to measles’ as superior to vaccine-induced immunity,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what still worries medical experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy, increasing measles spread and questionable decisions from the current administration concern medical professionals. Below, they share their thoughts on the current measles outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles is known as a “herald infection” because it’s the first disease that shows up when vaccination rates are low.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is what experts call a “herald infection,” because “typically, when we see an outbreak of measles, that heralds the fact that vaccine rates have dropped enough that we’re starting to see these,” Meade said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then we may start to see other things, like polio, like mumps, other things that we haven’t seen in this country for quite some time,” added Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuzzo noted that a school in &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Texas reported a rubella case" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Texas reported a rubella case&lt;/a&gt;, which is pertinent because the measles vaccine, which is known as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine also prevents rubella infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason that measles shows up first is because it’s highly contagious, said Meade. It’s more contagious than both COVID and the flu. “It’s one of the most contagious illnesses that we see,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just to put things in perspective for people, if someone has measles and they cough or sneeze in a room, and then they leave the room, and you walk into the room two hours later, you can become infected with measles,” explained Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pediatricians across the country have a very deep understanding of infectious diseases and how something like measles can actually really herald a bigger problem,” said Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of measles patients in Texas are hospitalized, which is worrisome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of people in the hospital, and I have to say that is also deeply concerning, one because measles is very tough for hospitals because of the isolation that’s required [since] it’s such a contagious disease, [and] there’s so many vulnerable people in hospitals,” said Nuzzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;According to data&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Health and Human Services department, 20 of 146 people are currently hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. suggested in last week’s cabinet meeting that people are in the hospital for quarantine and isolation, which isn’t true, Nuzzo noted. They’re in the hospital because they’re sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, just to say that, yes, we have had a death, but we also have a lot of people in the hospital, and that means that they are ill enough to be in the hospital,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jan Sonnenmair via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jan Sonnenmair via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"We are seeing comments that this is 'normal,' or it's expected, and a death of a child from measles in the United States should never be expected because we have a way to prevent this," said Dr. Elizabeth Meade.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They worry this outbreak could impact the country’s ability to maintain our measles elimination status.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We declared measles eliminated, which is you drive down the incidence to near zero, but not necessarily zero, like 25 years ago,” said Nuzzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the U.S. has been able to maintain its measles elimination status, but there was a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="large measles outbreak in New York" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;large measles outbreak in New York&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 where the U.S. just “barely missed losing our measles elimination status, so we’ve retained it.” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when we have outbreaks that spiral out of control that could imperil our measles elimination status ... I think [it] has consequences,” Nuzzo noted. “It has huge psychological consequences in terms of what kind of country we are and how committed to public health we are. That would put us on par with some of the more resource-constrained settings in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, I think it is something that we have to take quite seriously in terms of our stature,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re worried about your health or your loved ones health, there are precautions you can take.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With measles cases cropping up throughout the country, it’s natural to be worried. But “if you’re a fully vaccinated individual [and] you are not immunocompromised, you should have no reason to be scared,” said Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t sure if you’ve had your measles vaccine, you can talk to your doctor about getting your titers drawn, which is a blood test that shows the level of antibodies in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t been vaccinated or haven’t had both doses of the shot, Meade said your best bet is to get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first MMR dose is generally given to babies at 12 months, but if you are worried about your child’s exposure, talk to your doctor about getting them the vaccine early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do this for kids who have to travel out of the country to places that have endemic measles, and we’re certainly doing it for children who are living near the epicenters of the current outbreaks that we’re seeing,” Meade said. Generally, this is done for babies who are at least 6 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Get Our Lifestyle Coverage Ad-Free&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

One company sees that as a win-win for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;America’s aging population means that the demand for in-home care services has never been higher. One company sees that as a win-win for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seniorshelpingseniors.com/"&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors&lt;/a&gt; employs mostly retirees to provide in-home nonmedical care, support and companionship, with a team of senior care professionals who train and assist them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do have nurses who supervise and oversee care. Most of our caregivers are retired professionals who are looking to stay active and earn a little extra money,” said Ben Chernow, owner of Seniors Helping Seniors in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other franchises in Laurel, Maryland, and Springfield and Centreville, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caregiver positions start at $20 per hour and increase to $21 per hour after completing a dementia certification course. The company said it also offers retirement benefits and flexible work schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For clients, costs vary by location and services involved, but care generally costs around $40 per hour. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who are right for the job (the company says it only hires caregivers who have the compassion and interpersonal skills to build relationships) provide an advantage for those they are caring for. They are seen as peers, not just hired help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the main places we see that is people who have dementia, Often, built into that dementia is resistance to care and unwillingness to open their home to a caregiver. That resistance is something we are able to work around, because of the comfort level with somebody who is closer in age to them,” said Chernow, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, who left the legal profession to do something he said he found more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors caregivers come from diverse backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our caregivers include former diplomats, attorneys, business executives,” Chernow said. “We actually just hired a former Olympic gymnast. It is a really diverse group of people who often don’t have a background in this. We provide them the training and knowledge they need in order to be good caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors also makes it a priority to match clients with caregivers who have compatible personalities and similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors was founded in 1998 and began franchising in 2006. It now has 180 franchise operators and 350 locations in 38 states.&lt;/p&gt;

            The measles outbreak is surging in West Texas, especially in under-vaccinated communities, but it’s not just coverage with the measles vaccine that is lagging behind. The use of other key vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule has decreased too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We are extremely concerned that all of these vaccine preventable illnesses may potentially be making a comeback … But that is, sadly, what may be a reality for us If we continue on a path of questioning legitimate science,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.

            Rates of pertussis, better known as whooping cough, declined after widespread vaccine use began in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html#:~:text=Widespread%20use%20of%20the%20vaccine,with%20the%20pre%2Dvaccine%20era." target="_blank"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but later decreased during the pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to masking and distancing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Experts say declining vaccination has now lead to an uptick in cases. Last year, there were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough in the US, the largest number seen in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Whooping cough, a contagious respiratory illness can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when people try to catch their breath. Severe cases can be fatal. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; 10 people died, including six less than 1 year old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It most severely affects infants but the DTaP vaccine can prevent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/cases-of-whooping-cough-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank"&gt;nine out of 10&lt;/a&gt; infants from hospitalization. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20routine%20DTaP%20vaccination,4%20through%206%20years" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends five DTaP doses before the age of 7, with follow up boosters of Tdap in adolescence and adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Polio&lt;/a&gt; is a contagious virus that at first may give flu-like symptoms but could in some more serious cases progress to meningitis or even paralysis. The CDC recommends four doses of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/effectiveness-duration-protection.html" target="_blank"&gt;99% effective&lt;/a&gt;, before the age of 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “If you drop immunization rates low enough in various areas, polio could come back,” said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Philadelphia Children’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001q3b5v39xpkv8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polio cases were once common in the United States and around the world. During one of the&lt;a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/Polio%20.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; most severe outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in 1952, the virus infected 58,000 people in the US, paralyzed more than 21,000 and killed more than 3,100. However, vaccination campaigns cut cases dramatically. The last naturally occurring case of polio in the US was in 1979.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001r3b5vapt3081a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2022, a man in Rockland County, New York, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/new-york-polio/index.html"&gt;developed a paralysis&lt;/a&gt; from polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001s3b5vtjjaj75g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He represented the tip of much bigger iceberg. Only one in 200 people who are infected with polio will be paralyzed by it,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001t3b5vs98oc9h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More of the community likely had the virus, experts say. Vaccination rates in Rockland County were only around &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/county_vaccination_rates.htm" target="_blank"&gt;60%.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001u3b5v52ysbtj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In that particular man’s ZIP code or area, immunization rates had dropped … that’s why it arose there. So let that happen elsewhere and you could see that happen again,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Fewer vaccinations and more illnesses
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001w3b5vxrmyphe8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If vaccination rates continue to decline, the US can expect to see more cases of pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae type b, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis, and rotavirus, according to Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7takksp00003b5v4mceql38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without use of the HPV vaccine, experts warn there could be an increase in HPV associated cancers, like cervical, throat and neck cancer, within the next few decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001x3b5vhz502p4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These are all included in the routine childhood vaccine schedule – the one that US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to investigate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7tcsfh700063b6mirb2ys83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The childhood immunization schedule is decided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with input from its outside vaccine advisers. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians and American College of Obestetricians and Gynecologists also approve the schedule. This informs the best time for children to get vaccinated depending on when they will best be able to build immunity against specific illnesses and when they could become most susceptible to diseases. The vaccines on the schedule undergo&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies to make sure they are safe to use with other vaccines in the schedule and safety data is continuously evaluated, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001y3b5vrqaczefz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of these aren’t necessarily benign illnesses,” said Johns. “Everybody seems to think that these are all just mild illnesses that you have to get through. And I think that sadly, because vaccines have been such a victim of their own success, we haven’t seen a lot of these infections … so it’s it can be easy to be tricked into thinking that it’s not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe2rkl00123b5v63hult58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some vaccine preventable illnesses still circulate abroad, a problem which could be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s extensive funding cuts from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/usaid-government-spending-global-aid-dg/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;, which supported immunization programs around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I think we’re very selfish,” said Offit. “We’re just focused on ourselves, as if what happens in the world doesn’t affect us, even if we want to be selfish about it … what happens in other places matters.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe6tc200343b5ve489wll0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seeing the toll these illnesses can have on patients, some countries experience less hesitance with vaccination than the US does, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe6tc200353b5vgklfyiuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the drivers of [vaccination] success in these countries is the acute awareness that parents’ have about the potential devastation these vaccine preventable diseases may have on their children and families,” wrote Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The measles outbreak is surging in West Texas, especially in under-vaccinated communities, but it’s not just coverage with the measles vaccine that is lagging behind. The use of other key vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule has decreased too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            With lower vaccination rates, experts worry about what vaccine preventable illnesses we could see next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Coverage with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), polio, and varicella, or chickenpox vaccines, all &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt; in more than 30 states last year compared with the year before.

            “We are extremely concerned that all of these vaccine preventable illnesses may potentially be making a comeback … But that is, sadly, what may be a reality for us If we continue on a path of questioning legitimate science,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The percentage of kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt;, leaving thousands of children vulnerable. Protection among those who are vaccinated can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;fade over time&lt;/a&gt;.

            In 2022, a man in Rockland County, New York, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/new-york-polio/index.html"&gt;developed a paralysis&lt;/a&gt; from polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “He represented the tip of much bigger iceberg. Only one in 200 people who are infected with polio will be paralyzed by it,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            More of the community likely had the virus, experts say. Vaccination rates in Rockland County were only around &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/county_vaccination_rates.htm" target="_blank"&gt;60%.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “In that particular man’s ZIP code or area, immunization rates had dropped … that’s why it arose there. So let that happen elsewhere and you could see that happen again,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Fewer vaccinations and more illnesses
&lt;/h2&gt;

            If vaccination rates continue to decline, the US can expect to see more cases of pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae type b, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis, and rotavirus, according to Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Without use of the HPV vaccine, experts warn there could be an increase in HPV associated cancers, like cervical, throat and neck cancer, within the next few decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            These are all included in the routine childhood vaccine schedule – the one that US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to investigate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7tcsfh700063b6mirb2ys83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The childhood immunization schedule is decided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with input from its outside vaccine advisers. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians and American College of Obestetricians and Gynecologists also approve the schedule. This informs the best time for children to get vaccinated depending on when they will best be able to build immunity against specific illnesses and when they could become most susceptible to diseases. The vaccines on the schedule undergo&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies to make sure they are safe to use with other vaccines in the schedule and safety data is continuously evaluated, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “All of these aren’t necessarily benign illnesses,” said Johns. “Everybody seems to think that these are all just mild illnesses that you have to get through. And I think that sadly, because vaccines have been such a victim of their own success, we haven’t seen a lot of these infections … so it’s it can be easy to be tricked into thinking that it’s not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some vaccine preventable illnesses still circulate abroad, a problem which could be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s extensive funding cuts from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/usaid-government-spending-global-aid-dg/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;, which supported immunization programs around the world.

            “I think we’re very selfish,” said Offit. “We’re just focused on ourselves, as if what happens in the world doesn’t affect us, even if we want to be selfish about it … what happens in other places matters.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe6tc200343b5ve489wll0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seeing the toll these illnesses can have on patients, some countries experience less hesitance with vaccination than the US does, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “One of the drivers of [vaccination] success in these countries is the acute awareness that parents’ have about the potential devastation these vaccine preventable diseases may have on their children and families,” wrote Martinello.

&lt;p&gt;Here is the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) notified Dare County health officials on March 3 of a laboratory confirmed positive test result for Highly Pathogenic Avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 or bird flu in a backyard flock in Dare County. &lt;span id="more-331930"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-1be1ad034c6eb7be1ec7a1d0754990b8 outer-mobile-content-top" id="outer-1be1ad034c6eb7be1ec7a1d0754990b8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-3885d5750879c832e8cbd565056dce84 outer-content-top" id="outer-3885d5750879c832e8cbd565056dce84"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first confirmed positive in a backyard flock in Dare County. In January, HPAI was found in a commercial operation in Hyde County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In coordination with the flock owner, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture has completed a depopulation of the flock and Dare County Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services (DCDHHS) officials are working with state partners to respond to any potential human exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is a disease caused by avian influenza A virus, which can affect most species of birds and some animals. While Avian flu can make people sick, it is rare and the risk to the public remains low. To date, there has been no human-to-human spread identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-09a29d6f0bdec881c76ac90642b92b1f outer-mobile-content-mid" id="outer-09a29d6f0bdec881c76ac90642b92b1f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;March 3, 2020: It's the day we learned of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in our state, and the day life changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Strange words suddenly became part of our daily lexicon: Social distancing. Flatten the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;We donned masks for daily tasks. Many stopped hugging family members who didn't live in the same household.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Soon, schools and church sanctuaries emptied out—as did our sidewalks, restaurants and streets. A certain solitude set in. And sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It was March 3, 2020, when Governor Roy Cooper said a man in Wake County tested positive for coronavirus. It was North Carolina’s first case of the new illness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The patient had recently traveled to Washington state and was exposed to a long-term care facility that had reported numerous cases of coronavirus. The Wake County patient traveled through Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Feb. 22, 2020, airport officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;At that time, nine people had died from the illness in Washington state, all in the Seattle area. Washington state officials had reported 27 confirmed cases of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Among the first North Carolinians the virus claimed was a Raleigh city employee, a man in his mid-30s named Adrian Grubbs.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"All this happened so fast," his wife told us then.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She said he was a loving husband and devoted father.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Since then, more than 34,000 people in our state have died from the virus. From Jan. 1, 2020, to Sept. 9, 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/index.htm"&gt;the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics reported&lt;/a&gt; that 34,265 people in North Carolina died from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;

Individuals experiencing depression, both currently and in the past, showed alterations in various small molecules in their blood, particularly those related to fats. These findings suggest that disruptions in the body’s metabolism, especially concerning fats, may play a significant role in the development and experience of depression, opening new avenues for understanding and potentially treating this widespread condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is known to be a multifaceted condition influenced by genetics, environment, and lifestyle. While psychological and social factors are clearly important, researchers are increasingly recognizing that biological processes within the body are also deeply involved. Previous studies exploring the body’s chemistry in relation to depression have often been limited in scope, either focusing on a small number of substances or not involving participants formally diagnosed with depression through thorough psychiatric assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these limitations and gain a more comprehensive view, researchers aimed to conduct a detailed investigation of a wide range of substances in the blood of a large group of people, including those with current and past depression, as well as healthy individuals, and to repeat these measurements over time. This approach was designed to identify a robust and reliable biological signature associated with major depressive disorder and to explore potential causal links between these biological changes and depression itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the research team utilized data from a large, ongoing Dutch study called the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. This study has been tracking the mental and physical health of thousands of participants over many years. For this particular analysis, the researchers examined blood samples collected from 2,770 participants at the start of the study. This group included 1,101 people who were experiencing major depressive disorder at the time of the study, 868 people who had experienced depression in the past but were currently in remission, and 801 healthy individuals with no history of depression. Six years later, blood samples were collected again from 1,805 of these participants, allowing for a follow-up analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the study underwent detailed assessments, including psychiatric interviews to determine if they met the criteria for major depressive disorder according to established diagnostic guidelines. The severity of their depressive symptoms was also measured using a self-report questionnaire that asked about their mood and other symptoms in the week prior to the assessment. In addition to collecting blood samples, the researchers gathered information on various factors that could influence both depression and the substances in the blood. These factors included age, sex, education level, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, existing chronic diseases, and medication use, including lipid-lowering drugs and different types of antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood samples were analyzed using a sophisticated technology that can measure hundreds of different small molecules, known as metabolites, in a single sample. This platform, called Metabolon, allowed the researchers to get a broad overview of the body’s metabolic state. The researchers implemented rigorous quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their metabolite measurements. They then used statistical models to examine the relationships between the levels of these metabolites and depression status (current depression, past depression, or healthy control) and depression symptom severity, while taking into account the various influencing factors they had measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further explore the nature of these relationships, the researchers also employed a technique called Mendelian randomization. This method uses genetic variations as tools to investigate potential cause-and-effect relationships between metabolite levels and depression risk. By leveraging large genetic datasets, they could examine if genetically predicted changes in metabolite levels were associated with a higher or lower risk of developing depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the initial blood samples revealed that a substantial number of metabolites were different in people with current major depressive disorder compared to healthy controls. Specifically, 139 metabolites showed significant differences. Among these, 92 were found to be at lower levels, while 47 were at higher levels in individuals with current depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large proportion of these altered metabolites, 79 in total, were also associated with the severity of depression symptoms, meaning that the more severe the symptoms, the more pronounced the changes in these metabolites. Interestingly, many of the same metabolites that were altered in people with current depression were also changed in those with past depression, although the changes were generally less pronounced in the remitted group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that a significant portion of the altered metabolites were lipids, or fat-like substances. When the researchers grouped the metabolites into biological pathways, they found that certain pathways related to fats were particularly affected. Metabolites that were found to be decreased in depression were enriched in long-chain monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids, which are types of fats that are important for energy storage and cell structure. Conversely, metabolites that were increased in depression were enriched in lysophospholipids, a class of fats that play roles in cell signaling and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the robustness of their findings, the researchers repeated some of their analyses using the blood samples collected six years later. They were able to confirm 34 of the initially identified metabolites, finding consistent directions of change between the baseline and follow-up measurements. This replication strengthened the evidence that these metabolic alterations are indeed linked to depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, using Mendelian randomization, the researchers explored whether any of the identified metabolites might have a causal role in depression. Their analysis suggested that genetically predicted higher levels of a specific lysophospholipid, called 1-linoleoyl-GPE, were associated with an increased risk of depression. This finding provides preliminary evidence that this particular fat-like substance, or the biological processes that control its levels, could potentially contribute to the development of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged some limitations to their study. While the follow-up measurements provided some confirmation, it was not a completely independent replication because it involved the same group of people at a later time point. Future studies in entirely new groups of participants are needed to further validate these findings. Additionally, the study design was observational, mainly showing associations rather than definitive proof of cause and effect, except for the preliminary causal evidence from the Mendelian randomization.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INDIANA, USA — The Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division (DNR) said they have &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/life/animals/sandhill-crane-bird-flu-deaths-indiana/417-09ba1bc6-2bdb-4535-bddf-3f5a575c68a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;detected bird flu&lt;/a&gt; in a total of 30 counties. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu has hit Indiana's commercial poultry and egg farms especially hard. The state Board of Animal health &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/boah/species-information/avianbirds/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza/2022-2023-case-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;estimates almost 7 million birds &lt;/a&gt;have been impacted by the virus at almost 40 facilities statewide. But wild birds are also at risk. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indiana DNR said they are continuing to detect highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds throughout Indiana. The Indiana DNR also said HPAI is suspected in an additional 32 counties based on reports involving the deaths of raptors, cranes and waterfowl. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the counties where HPAI has been detected in wild birds:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HPAI is a disease caused by an influenza virus that usually spreads among birds. It is common in wild birds, especially waterfowl, shorebirds, and raptors," the Indiana DNR Division of Fish and Wildlife said in a news release. "Notably, &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/life/animals/sandhill-crane-bird-flu-deaths-indiana/417-09ba1bc6-2bdb-4535-bddf-3f5a575c68a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than 1,500 sandhill cranes have been affected by the virus&lt;/a&gt; since January, resulting in a large number of sandhill crane deaths in Greene, Jackson, Jasper, LaPorte, Newton, Starke, and Union counties."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;If you find sick or dead wild birds, please report them &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/dnr/fish-and-wildlife/wildlife-resources/wildlife-diseases-in-indiana/sick-or-dead-wildlife-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's affecting waterfowl across the whole world," Eli Fleace, wildlife biologist for Indiana DNR, said. "It's been found in multiple different countries across a lot of different continents. It's so spread out, that it's even affected penguins down in Antarctica."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

However, he also notes, there can be wide variability regarding health and appearance among people of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“You can see 70-year-olds who look like they are 50 and 70-year-olds who look like they’re 90,” says Lachs. “It’s very individualized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Genetics, lifestyle choices and the conditions in which a person lives can affect how they age. It’s also possible for your chronological age – how many years you’ve been alive – to differ from your biological age – how old your body appears – based on biomarkers and how well your body is functioning. Even your organs can &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06802-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;age at different rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-the-body-change-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How does the body change in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While there is no “normal” way to age, certain health challenges can be more common during your 70s. By age 75, people typically receive, on average, between two to three medical diagnoses, explains Lachs; these might include arthritis, hypertension and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lachs says that people in their 70s can remain independent and generally healthy, depending on factors such as economic background, genetics, psychosocial environment and motivation to commit to good habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4db95704-402d-4451-8e9a-86dd892e3bf7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The likelihood of hearing loss increases with age, says Lachs, though to what extent depends on the individual. About &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in three&lt;/a&gt; people between 65 and 74 and nearly half of people older than 75 have hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s also possible that your reaction time may slow down, says Lachs, but not to a concerning extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Seventy is a great time for somebody to try something new&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeffrey Stokes, University of Massachusetts Boston&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;People in their 70s might also experience sleep issues. Research &lt;a href="https://www.sleepmedres.org/journal/view.php?number=193" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; sleep quality decreases as age increases; &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2013/04/sleep-it#:~:text=" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found adults older than 60 had a 70% loss of deep sleep compared with people between 18 and 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, compared with other decades, the 70s can be a pretty stable time for health, says Dr Deborah Kado, a professor of medicine and co-director of the Stanford Longevity Center. This is especially true for women, the majority of whom already experienced swings of change when they went through &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/17/perimenopause-symptoms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;. There will always be unforeseeable health hurdles, but these can happen at any age; what’s key, she says, is committing to healthy behaviors before you turn 70 and sticking with them after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-health-tests-should-you-get-regularly-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Which health tests should you get regularly in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many health screenings recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK for older adults are framed as guidance for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/24/healthy-aging-process-60s" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adults aged 65 and older&lt;/a&gt;. The free NHS &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-health-check/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health check&lt;/a&gt; concludes at age 74. In part, this lack of guidance explicitly aimed at older ages is due to limited research on the effectiveness of these tests, says Kado. A Harvard Medical School &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/screening-after-age-75" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on screening after age 75 also observes that it can be difficult to provide general recommendations because individual needs at this stage can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Screenings become more complicated as we age, and knowing when to stop screening can be challenging, Lachs explains. If you have a family history of a disease, it can be helpful to speak with your doctor about what’s right for you and discuss the costs and benefits. For some, a screening could lead to preventative care that increases quality of life. For others, incidental findings may primarily cause anxiety and lead to invasive, minimally helpful procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One screening Lachs does recommend for people in their 70s is a bone mineral density test, which measures bone strength and thickness. This test is a tool for &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis/diagnosis-treatment-and-steps-to-take" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;early intervention&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/22/osteoporosis-menopause-bone-density-diagnosis-treatment" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, which becomes more common as people age. While men typically lose bone density more slowly than women, both groups lose bone mass at about the same rate by age 65 to 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="20e5e4fe-14fa-40a3-89e8-180e8f91a0fa" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Taking care of the grandchildren?

If, for example, a screening like this suggests a person is at risk for falling, Lachs can recommend that they work with a physical therapist to decrease that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a volunteer group of national experts, does &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007466.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; men and women be screened for colorectal cancer regularly from age 65 to 75 and for lung cancer between 50 and 80. The USPSTF also &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007463.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;observes&lt;/a&gt; that mammograms “work best” at finding cancer in women aged 40 to 74, and it’s not clear how helpful these tests are for women 75 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The NHS offers bowel cancer &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bowel-cancer-screening/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;screenings&lt;/a&gt; for everyone aged 54 to 74. It​​ also provides lung cancer &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lung-cancer-screening/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;screenings&lt;/a&gt; to people who have smoked between the ages of 55 and 74. The NHS also &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/breast-screening-helping-women-decide/nhs-breast-screening-helping-you-decide#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;invites&lt;/a&gt; women aged 50 to 71 to have a breast cancer screening – though women over 71 can still make appointments to screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-vaccines-should-you-get-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Which vaccines should you get in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lachs strongly recommends people stay up to date with their vaccines. He speaks with his patients about the increased importance of vaccinating as an older person; unvaccinated older adults are at a greater risk of experiencing severe illness; as we get older, it’s harder for the &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/why-vaccinations-are-vital-for-older-adults/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; to fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Several vaccines are recommended for older adults, though it’s important to speak with your care provider about what is right for you. In the US, the NIH &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/immunizations-and-vaccines/vaccinations-and-older-adults" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting vaccinated for Covid-19, flu, pneumonia and shingles, and getting the Tdap; the latter is the vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and all adults are advised to get one dose and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-age.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;then a booster&lt;/a&gt; every 10 years.

Instead, any type of cardiovascular exercise at modest levels will do, including actions like dancing, walking and climbing the stairs. He’s especially a fan of yoga because it helps with balance and flexibility while providing a social outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/jun/14/what-is-social-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Positive, enriching relationships&lt;/a&gt; also strengthen physical and cognitive health, which promotes longevity, says Stokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;There’s no drug better than a good night’s sleep&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr Mark Lachs, Weill Cornell Medicine&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;As people hit 70, they tend to put less effort into casual relationships and invest more into their already closest and most rewarding connections, he explains. Often retired, they focus more on their marriages, kids and grandkids. Being a grandparent who helps out can be especially rewarding because research suggests &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;strong relationships&lt;/a&gt; that provide a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18429482/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sense of purpose&lt;/a&gt; are even likelier to imbue health benefits, Stokes explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d72fd489-c707-4250-8f66-299ac1aa5051" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But while people in their 70s are good at focusing on their most rewarding relationships and repairing the benefits, they’re less skilled at creating and fostering new relationships, Stokes says. Targeting this area “can go a long way in reducing some of the loneliness and isolation” that can affect people’s oldest years, he explains. Close ties are great, but it can be even better to have a rich and diverse social network that can support you – especially because bereavement can become more common as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lifespan can also be improved through diet – less meat and more plants, advises Lachs. A 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00793-y" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found a combination of consuming foods or supplements rich in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/03/an-omega-3-dose-a-day-could-slow-ageing-process-healthspan-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;omega-3 oils&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin D, combined with exercise, is a recipe for slowing biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sleep is important, too. The National Institute on Ageing (NIA) and the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-health-issues/sleep/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/sleep/good-nights-sleep#:~:text=rest" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that older adults get seven to nine hours each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s no drug I could prescribe that is better than a good night’s sleep,” Lachs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-too-late-to-get-fit-after-70" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is it too late to get fit after 70?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Studies suggest that by adopting healthy lifestyle choices, you can “reverse a lot of damage and physiologically even appear younger than you did before you implemented those changes”, says Kado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is true for your 70s and beyond,” she says. “You can be in a nursing home in your 90s, start high-intensity interval training, and see over 170% increase in your thigh muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the NIA, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that exercises that support endurance, balance, strength and flexibility help older adults maintain muscle mass and stay healthy and independent for longer. The NIA also emphasizes that almost anyone at any age can exercise and offers &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/exercise-and-physical-activity/exercising-chronic-conditions" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for people with chronic conditions. A 2009 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/485271" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that adults who started exercising between the ages of 70 and 78 were more likely to live longer and be less lonely than adults of the same age who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But the reverse is also true. If people don’t engage in behaviors like exercising, their health will likely decline, Kado says. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9772844/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that about 30% of adults over 70 have trouble with walking, climbing stairs and getting out of a chair. These results can be mitigated by exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you don’t use your muscles, you’re going to lose more muscle and be more likely to lose your mobility,” she says. “This can impact your mood, independence and cognitive ability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-stop-worrying-about-getting-older" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How do you stop worrying about getting older?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Thoughts about ageing are often plagued by ageism, says Stokes. This viewpoint causes us to hyperfocus on the negative aspects of ageing, and incorrectly predict what getting older will be like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s an overemphasis on decline,” he says. “People in their 70s often say that they don’t feel old, and the reason for it is that they don’t meet the definition of old we often use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Further, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-832261.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests people with more positive views of ageing are the ones who live longer. Kado describes a more positive view of ageing as a “type of resilience” that helps a person deal with life’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="16eac6c7-6d5f-4f59-bb00-5d54133bc379" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":51,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"After being dumped at 58, I realized I was not equipped for the grief","elementId":"16eac6c7-6d5f-4f59-bb00-5d54133bc379","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jan/27/gray-divorce-grief"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Generally, my older patients who are doing super well beyond their 70s have that resilience factor,” says Kado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;We can also combat fears of getting older by embracing the positive aspects of ageing, says Stokes. For example, when it comes to mental and emotional health, people in their 70s tend to be happier and more satisfied than people in their 40s and 50s, he explains. The stress of child-rearing and work is likely gone, and they have a greater capacity to enjoy the good and ignore the bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The ultimate irony about ageism is you become the object of your discrimination,” says Lachs. “Find older role models, people in their 80s and 90s, and learn from them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:15:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBnb25LUVlhcklJR0F2M1h2ckdmUmlXV0F2X1dWYzMxQ0ZsVU5zMDZfa0dRVUxDM2NuZXNVRW55MVVGVGFGbS12OTh6VHdqV3FVT2tjWGJxUm5Bc3ZxVWw0VFFQRE16VDhiY3NJOGdvYjFBV2UyaDltek9tSHZTems</guid></item><item><title>Got Disgusting Pink Slime In Your Bathroom?

It wasn’t the work of prophets turning water to wine, however, but an outbreak of bacteria Venetian pharmacist Bartolomeo Bizio named &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you this? Because if you’ve got pink goo in your bathroom, you have been visited by the same bloody pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serratia &lt;/em&gt;is a genus of gram-negative bacteria that sits within the Enterobacteriaceae family. The species &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; is fond of moist environments, which is why it’s a common culprit in bathrooms, kitchens, along the seams of shower curtains, and around &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/a-household-invader-may-be-setting-up-camp-in-your-sink-66584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;plugholes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an almost ironic twist of events, it can be especially fond of the little cubby holes where you store soap because it feeds on fatty deposits, which are the building blocks of soaps and shampoos. There have also been hospital outbreaks associated with contaminated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3592283/" target="_blank"&gt;soap dispensers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; dangerous?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As TikTok physician &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.karanr/video/7434227340990827809?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;Dr Karan Raj&lt;/a&gt; explained in a recent video, for people with fully functioning immune systems, encountering &lt;em&gt;S. marcescens&lt;/em&gt; is typically harmless. However, it does have the potential to cause nasty infections, particularly respiratory and urinary infections. It’s not considered a common cause of primary disease, but can result in significant symptoms when it’s able to infect someone who is already compromised due to illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.karanr/video/7434227340990827809" data-video-id="7434227340990827809" id="v69407367456975150"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="social-disclaimer-icon"&gt;ⓘ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="social-disclaimer"&gt;IFLScience is not responsible for content shared from external sites.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of its capacity to spread comes down to the fact that it can form a &lt;a href="https://microbenotes.com/serratia-marcescens-an-overview/" target="_blank"&gt;biofilm&lt;/a&gt; (something we’ve harnessed to make “&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/exploiting-bacteria-produce-living-materials-24069" target="_blank"&gt;living materials&lt;/a&gt;”), making it easier to stick to surfaces and spread. This can include medical devices and catheters, and once they’ve infected a host the biofilm can form a barrier against their immune response. Infections can be difficult to treat, so it’s a bacteria you really want to avoid. Fortunately, its bright coloration makes it easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get rid of &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve spotted the dreaded pink slime colonizing your bathroom, it’s time to get the marigolds out and mix a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water in a spray bottle. You can drench the bacteria in the vinegar-water mix and leave to stand for &lt;a href="https://smol.com/uk/stories/help-what-are-these-pink-mould-stains-in-my-shower?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"&gt;10 minutes&lt;/a&gt;, then scrub and rinse away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should be sufficient to get rid of the pink slime that has already attached itself to your bathroom, but the next step is prevention. &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; likes moist environments, so crack open a window after you’ve showered or get the extractor fan on to keep humidity to a minimum. You can also make the soapy bits of your bathroom less inviting for &lt;em&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/em&gt; by ensuring any soap residue gets swiftly wiped away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of humidity can invite a veritable rainbow of pathogens into your home, so good ventilation can help you to keep a host of unwanted nasties out.

Babies 6 to 11 months old who are traveling internationally should get one dose of the vaccine, and babies who have had an MMR dose before their first birthday should get two more doses starting at a year old, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Lorraine said that &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/montgomery-county-measles-outbreak-2025-children-parents-20250303.html" target="_blank"&gt;parents can also ask their doctors&lt;/a&gt; about getting their child’s second vaccine slightly early if they are planning to travel internationally or to a place in the United States where a measles outbreak is occurring, like Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The case in Montgomery County can serve as a reminder for adults to make sure they’re up to date on all their vaccines, Lorraine said. “It’s a good time to double check your immune status,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor’s note: This story was updated with additional information about the Montgomery County case, and to clarify the number of hospitalizations in an outbreak last year in Philadelphia.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Philadelphia Inquirer</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 16:13:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQbUVtZ2JwaW5VdUhxXzd6M0tuWlpnbnJKeUxQN1dGcVlFaUtIM1U1MHRIYkR5ZHh6QjJjYlU3OUNVQnB4WHdqYUVWMlRORmdqR1hoV0xMVHRtUWRPQ01IUFRlRnhmaHZyU0JycXJ2SkVtbWdmWVRyRWd3Y0ZDWF9raklia3hkSV81dHhCWUFqU3N1QVpTc0IyZkNjNmlIbkRvZlE</guid></item><item><title>How Louisiana poultry farms are faring when it comes to bird flu - Greater Baton Rouge Business Report</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPRXdJZEd6SS05SmpQRzdPUVVhOUoySk4zYmtEV0RMb1RpazVRU2k3cnV4R1lmM1l5Vy1NOW9FRHNCSHlwTlJIdHlTam1nYnhaYXdqVDlJMlpsTmdHdXFOc29mOGJ5Z0xxcUhLTDRWckJGY2R0NVJUYlJqWllPZkc3Ml9MUVo1OVBoY2pBWXJQOFdzZnpwblhlbW01V28wcnFSckF3ZmFB0gGuAUFVX3lxTE5NZjlJdUZlamJDYWVPYUp0MG1RT0ZGMnlSeng3aUgzWTkyd3Mzc24wN3UtQ3VUdEpjNUdubldNOVQtQVY4b0R0Uk1kakl5UUd1YXJBTzJudU1aZEJUWTlfbDRKZ2NmWDFkd2ZoTHRWWm5xX1p6ek82M1hINmo4VFFWRC1rTl9mVGFjaS1NMGZGU0lTRFQ0SHZHczhvcWdEQ1EzZ1RIS1NLVVBScmhHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-261929" class="post-261929 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-daily_report_am category-newsletters category-article lbi-lbi_email_child lbi-lbi_email_daily_report_am" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the nation combats high egg prices due to viral chicken deaths, Louisiana officials say the state’s poultry farmers remain unaffected, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/state/2025/03/03/louisiana-commercial-poultry-farms-untouched-by-bird-flu-officials-say/80843092007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the USA Today network reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus is in the state, killing wild bird populations, but has largely avoided commercial poultry farmers thus far. The key, experts say, may be Louisiana cattle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture is spending $1 billion in a five-pronged approach to combat this year’s predicted 40% increase in egg prices. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;announcement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; came Feb. 26, though it’s currently unclear how much of that money will reach Louisiana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain says Louisiana’s 300 commercial poultry farmers so far have avoided the virus’s deadly path. In the past 30 days alone, 139 flocks have been infected, killing 18.72 million birds &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;nationwide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once a single chicken is infected, the entire flock must be culled, and other chicken coops miles away are at risk of the same fate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The bottom line is that if you get a house that’s infected, they will die within 36 to 48 hours—every bird there,” Strain says. “And then what happens is the amount of virus that is there generally spreads aerosolized to the next barn … if you do not shut off the fans and not stop the virus from multiplying in the barn, that virus can spread up to 8 miles away.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scale stuck on the same number for months?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/10/health/lose-weight-by-adding-these-5-foods-to-your-diet-doctor/"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt; can get much harder after a certain point because cutting too many calories can propel your body into “starvation mode,” slowing your metabolism and storing your fat instead of burning it for fuel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even people on drugs like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/18/health/famed-diabetes-doctor-reveals-whats-next-for-ozempic-like-drugs/"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/13/lifestyle/female-wegovy-users-may-have-greatest-weight-loss/"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; have found that their weight loss progress seems to drop off after shedding 20% to 25% of their weight — a phenomenon known as the “&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/why-weight-loss-drugs-stop-working-how-to-break-past-ozempic-plateau" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ozempic plateau&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers have discovered a way to potentially control the metabolic adaptation that stalls weight loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Liubomir – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/ravnskjaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kim Ravnskjaer&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular biology professor at the university, acknowledged that weight loss “usually goes well at first, but as people lose some of the weight they aim to shed, their progress stalls because the body’s metabolism adapts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new study suggests that we might be able to control this metabolic adaptation — which would be a total game-changer. &lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;“If we could develop a medication that helps maintain fat or sugar burning at its original high level alongside weight-loss treatments, people could continue losing weight beyond the usual plateau,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ravnskjaer and his team researched the role of a gene called Plvap in the livers of mice. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were aware from previous studies that people born without this gene tend to have issues with their lipid metabolism — the processes by which the body breaks down, transports and utilizes fats (lipids) for energy, storage and cellular functions — and they wanted to explore the connection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What they found was that this gene is largely responsible for controlling the metabolic shift of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/24/health/lose-belly-fat-fast-just-stop-eating-this-one-type-of-food/"&gt;burning sugar to fat&lt;/a&gt; while in “starvation mode.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the gene was deactivated in laboratory mice, the liver failed to recognize the fasting state and continued metabolizing sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This signals there might be a way to “trick” the liver into &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/09/health/a-berry-juice-can-boost-metabolism-and-may-help-burn-fat-study/"&gt;speeding up metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can control the liver’s burning of sugar and fat, we might also increase the effectiveness of weight-loss and diabetes medications,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ravnskjaer said. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Another exciting discovery was that the mice showed no negative effects throughout the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, they seemed to have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/31/health/experts-reveal-how-to-manage-your-blood-sugar-and-weight-d/"&gt;lower blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and improved insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s well known that elevated blood sugar may lead to chronic complications for people with type 2 diabetes,” Ravnskjaer said. “Understanding Plvap could help diabetics better regulate their blood sugar in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sdu.dk/da/om-sdu/fakulteterne/naturvidenskab/nyheder/fedt-stofskifte-kim-ravnskjaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The study’s findings&lt;/a&gt; were published Monday in the journal Cell Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research has been limited to mice so far, and human trials are still a ways away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a long way from insights in mouse experiments to bringing a drug to the market — but this is obviously the potential in our research,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
