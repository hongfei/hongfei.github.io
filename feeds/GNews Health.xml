by mimicking&lt;/a&gt; two hormones called GLP-1 and GIP, resulting in appetite suppression, increased production of insulin, greater insulin sensitivity and a reduction in the rate at which food is emptied from the stomach. The medication is available for weight loss to some people on the NHS and it can also be bought privately with a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Scientists at Eli Lilly, the company that makes Mounjaro, along with academic researchers have released two analyses of data from a three-year trial known as Surmount-1, throwing fresh light on the medication’s longer-term use. One analysis looked at trajectories of weight loss, the second at rebound after initial weight reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results, which are to be presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in Málaga next month and have yet to be peer reviewed, are based on data from about 700 participants who took tirzepatide in three different dose regimens during the 176-week study.

The team said the final average body weight reductions for these groups were 9.2%, 20.2% and 30.8% respectively. Each group encompassed around a third of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[The work] demonstrates that we can in some way predict total final weight loss from the speed of weight loss observed in the first months of treatment,” said Prof Luca Busetto, of the University of Padova in Italy, one of the scientists behind the first analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers said most of the participants maintained clinically meaningful weight reduction over the course of the study. This was supported by a second analysis that found that average time to the lowest weight reached was 22 months, at which point participants had lost 23.1% of their starting weight on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While some subsequently regained weight – despite continuing with the medication – participants had nonetheless lost 19.4% of their starting weight, on average, by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team added that 70% of participants regained less than 5% of their starting weight after hitting their lowest point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Naveed Sattar, of the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the trial, said the finding of different weight loss trajectories could help give an indication of how much weight an individual might expect to lose in the long term. “That might be able to guide the need for some individuals to consider newer therapies, which are more potent, in the future,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Simon Cork, of Anglia Ruskin University, said the other analysis demonstrated the long-term effectiveness of tirzepatide in maintaining weight loss, which would be of interest to health bodies “as the costs of treating obesity-related co-morbidities rise year on year”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cork also noted long-term effectiveness and safety studies for such drugs were now at odds with guidance, which limits their use to a maximum of two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings come as the Advertising Standards Authority announced that along with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the General Pharmaceutical Council, it had warned businesses that advertising prescription-only medications to the public was prohibited. This includes weight loss jabs such as Mounjaro, Wegovy and Saxenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among other examples, the rules cover paid-for ads on social media “such as image or video ads on Facebook, Instagram and TikTok”, sponsored searches on Google or other search engines, and ads by influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A Guardian investigation &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/26/experts-concern-promotions-weight-loss-jabs-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; that weight-loss injections were being aggressively marketed to British consumers through often illegal promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQcnVZMHgtOWd1Q19wdkNhYURVendnM3p4X09oakF4dXQwaU1sUlBMSUFweUprUF96Ymx2eXdIVEZBUUlGRkRHbktXZW5FM2dEUDBvSTVPeWtOb0dmQXhvdWVtMGNsNHhRQWNCMENXZjZNcDFzcmFqSlFSM0ZrazJDZ2JzNzB1TWt4Y0x4SDVSUFZWMm1TRUY4eE50TUw1cFdfWEY3d3ZteDR6WHhlZ3ZZdm9yQzVyYWV3RDFoNkFadS0</guid></item><item><title>Pet owners warned about fatal virus that's killing Colorado's raccoons - Denver Gazette</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi-gFBVV95cUxQRzdnTk1pSUx4OW44cmE3U0h1OUNXeGdWTlUwVnljRWxLSXg2UlA5LWJqc1dDQU1TS2xJWS1XcDdWd1NxUl9rVmQyOU9EdU1sbG5LNWV4OWdvYURlOVp6dUJJRGxqZDE2MzZxMTdaVTYwVmRjNTRkdXdSVGdpOHRrQnpoQUNJTlVCbjFweV93SE5ac25sWVZBT1N6ZnhfeU4xSFJxRGxjc3ltRVh2bDY0c2ZhR2trc25Za1poclR3SnNha1NFTldIUWd4a2dkd0NGWl9HUVlOTFM5YV9fVkFZM2ptaG9UZEtJSVRIUDhEeGpaazJBeG9jemNn0gH_AUFVX3lxTE0zalZvb3RTcFlHVzhUNnk3MkxPVUVHQlR0T0t0Zm5rbjlpTkl0NUp2cEJhRVZScWF2SndzWWZmSHBXT0U1T3J5dXlTc3VSZzh0VHlmMFFBZW92Qi1Sb2F1S05DcDJzbEJISFY3R2l1MjlsVVVjbXRpQjBqY0dTNUVEdFBIamg2X0hHVTdPNTh4c2JxU25iUmNmRmVSSTc4UU5SdVVYUXo5MWhvd1Y2eWZtTzFwUHgyc3k5dkQ3Y2ItUC1iSU9fVHJndGZTc0ZKeWp1T1o0cDM1QVJwQVpxazVFVVA1VGtqVHI0WmdveDVIb3djbzdwM0ZrenIwREFUNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife has issued a warning related to a virus that's been popping up among the state's raccoons, with that virus resulting in a highly contagious and fatal disease that can be passed to dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Colorado Parks and Wildlife, multiple raccoons in the San Luis Valley area have tested positive for canine distemper in recent weeks. Canine distemper is a disease that's spread via a virus, most commonly passed along through direct contact with an infected animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Signs of canine distemper can vary and may not be obvious, though it typically results in animals having difficulty moving and can result in abnormal behavior due to a brain infection. Other symptoms include crusting around the eyes and nose, coughing, diarrhea, vomiting, and thickening of the paw pads. Once an animal contracts the disease, it usually does not survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another particularly odd symptom associated with raccoons and distemper is that it can result in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wildlifephotography/comments/vdktna/wild_raccoon_showing_signs_of_distemper/" target="_blank"&gt;glowing green eyes&lt;/a&gt; – no joke (read more about symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.delawarehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Distemper-.FAQ_.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raccoons that tested positive for canine distemper were found in Alamosa and Monte Vista, though it's worth noting that other recent reports have indicated that the disease has been found among raccoon populations elsewhere in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado Parks and Wildlife stressed the importance of getting pets vaccinated and to avoid allowing animals to interact with wildlife. It was also suggested that people work to keep wildlife from frequenting their backyards and to avoid leaving out water and food that could become contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just dogs and raccoons that can be impacted either. While the disease doesn't pass to humans, Colorado species including coyotes, foxes, skunks, and other wild carnivores can contract it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

"Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose of the MMR vaccine if traveling internationally. They will still need two additional doses later. In Washington State, all children under age 19 can get vaccines for free," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected. It mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from about 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and rarely, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can happen even in healthy people, but those at highest risk include: infants and children under 5 years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and people with weakened immune systems from medications or underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with two doses providing about 97% protection against measles.

&lt;p&gt;"As the infectious dose of &lt;em&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/em&gt; O1 has been estimated to be 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;8 &lt;/sup&gt;[100,000 to 100 million] colony-forming units (CFU), this suggests the holy water was heavily contaminated and bacteria remained viable at ambient temperature during the flight and in Europe," the German and UK researchers who authored the report wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global plague&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing indicated that the cholera strain that the travelers brought home was a particularly nasty one. &lt;em&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/em&gt; O1, which is linked to other recent outbreaks in Eastern and Middle Africa, is resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics, namely: fluroquinolones, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, macrolides, and sulphonamides. The strain also carried a separate genetic element (a plasmid) that provided resistance mechanisms against streptomycin and spectinomycin, cephalosporins, macrolides, and sulphonamides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main treatment for cholera, which causes profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, is oral rehydration. Antibiotics are sometimes used to reduce severity. Fortunately, this strain was still susceptible to the antibiotic tetracycline, one of the drugs of choice for cholera. However, there are reports of other cholera strains in Africa that have also acquired tetracycline resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, "The extension of a cholera outbreak in Africa causing a cluster of infections in Europe is unusual," the authors write. They call for travelers to be aware of infectious threats when eating and drinking abroad—and to not ingest holy water. Clinicians should also be aware of the potential of cholera in travelers to Ethiopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To truly fight cholera outbreaks, though, there needs to be sustained investment in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Cases of cholera have surged globally after the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/04-09-2024-data-show-marked-increase-in-annual-cholera-deaths"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Low-income countries will continue to need overseas development aid support to control outbreaks and epidemics using effective WASH, surveillance, communications, diagnostics and countermeasure programmatic delivery," the authors of the Eurosurveillance report write.&lt;/p&gt;

And the best part: it's going to help you reduce cancer risk.'    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Costing less than $3 per serving, she claims that the healthy fats from the cheese, antioxidants in the olives and the fiber from the vegetables can do wonders for the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Every bite of fruit and vegetable – fresh, frozen, or canned – reduces your risk of cancer and recurrence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The short clip shows Andrews preparing some carrots, peppers and snap peas by washing them under water, chopping them and adding it to a bowl with Kalamata olives and a piece of string cheese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also noted that it is not necessary for the vegetables to be organic for them to be beneficial.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nichole Andrews, 38, a registered cancer dietician claims that this simple, budget-friendly snack can help keep the disease at bay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carrots are packed with beta-carotene, an antioxidant scientists believe may protect cells from damage and slow the growth of cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Filled with essential nutrients, including vitamin K and vitamin A, the vegetable can help reduce inflammation in the body, which is a driver of cancers forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, peppers also offer excellent sources of vitamins A and C, particularly red peppers as they also contain fiber, potassium and folic acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that can protect cells from damage that could lead to cancer, maintain cardiovascular health to prevent heart and blood related cancers and improve eye health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Folic acid also plays an important role in managing cell growth and division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is essential for producing the building blocks of DNA, the genetic material of our cells, maintains DNA stability and repair damaged DNA - therefore protecting cells from damage and ensuring that their reproductive cycle is maintained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While peas are a great source of plant-based protein and fiber - supporting digestion, heart health, olives are filled with monounsaturated fats and antioxidants which can significantly reduce the risk of developing cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber helps push out stool, clearing the digestive system of harmful toxins links to bowel and other cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Filled with Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin E and Zinc, peas can protect against plaque formation along blood vessel walls, which can cause disruptions in blood flow, create clots and cause inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A  combination of carrots, peppers, peas, olives and string cheese can stave off your chances of developing cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, magnesium, potassium, and other minerals found in peas can lower your risk of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Green peas also contain saponins, plant compounds known for having anti-cancer effects by preventing tumor growth and inducing cell death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, olives are filled with antioxidants such as like oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol that can neutralize and destroy cancerous cells in the body.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Combined with vegetables, the savory fruit can help prevent DNA damage and maintain the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite common notion, cheese is a healthy source of calcium, fat, Vitamins A and B12, along with zinc and phosphorus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The American Cancer Society at least 40 percent of all cancer cases and nearly 50 percent of cancer deaths in adults aged 30 years or older in the US are preventable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say that the calcium in cheese can help improve bone health, protein to build and maintain muscle tissue and some forms of aged cheeses also contain probiotics, which can benefit gut bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Andrews says that food is a key way to keep the disease at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know how amazing and powerful nutrition can be to help survivors have better treatment outcomes and reduce risk of recurrence,' Nichole, who is based in Tri-Cities, Washington, US, previously told Need To Know of her work in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sadly there is so much misinformation out there, that people cannot eat well – so I am so happy to clear up that confusion and help people eat with confidence.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society at least 40 percent of all cancer cases and nearly 50 percent of cancer deaths in adults aged 30 years or older in the US are preventable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in a single week has topped 90 for the first time since a record wave &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;figures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety-one cases of measles were reported with rashes that began the week of March 23, with Arkansas, Hawaii and Indiana joining the list of two dozen states with confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the week of March 30, 81 cases were reported, and another 21 cases were reported for the following week. But those figures are expected to rise as more cases are confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, at least 712 measles cases have been confirmed in the U.S. — the second-highest number of cases reported in a single year since the 1990s. Nearly 30,000 measles cases were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001999.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;reported in 1990&lt;/a&gt;, largely due to gaps in vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, there were 1,274 confirmed measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC said Friday there have been seven local outbreaks of the virus in the U.S., up from six last week. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring New Mexico remains the country's largest, with nearly 600 cases between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, asked about the new outbreaks. The agency &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-texas-measles-outbreak-layoffs-rfk-vaccines/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; outbreaks had been reported in Texas and New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's update came a day after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described his strategy for handling the current outbreak as a success, even after a third death of an unvaccinated American was linked to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our numbers in this country have now plateaued. And I want to thank CDC for that," Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy compared the nation's measles figures to those in Europe, which &lt;a href="https://measles-rubella-monthly.ecdc.europa.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;has seen&lt;/a&gt; thousands more measles cases and several more deaths. Health officials there have been grappling with &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;record measles&lt;/a&gt; cases in recent years due to steep gaps in vaccination rates in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike in Europe, prolonged local outbreaks of measles had been declared eliminated in the Americas. Officials &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-americas-risk-losing-elimination-status/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;have warned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that this year's outbreaks in the region are now threatening that public health achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also told President Trump at the Cabinet meeting, "We're trying to refocus the press. We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One CDC official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, warned that any apparent slowdown in recent measles cases should be treated with caution. Challenges in quickly identifying and reporting cases from the outbreaks can distort figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During outbreaks, weekly measles cases almost always appear to be lower in more recent weeks due to reporting delays, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some travelers to Texas and Kansas are also now being advised to get a second or early dose of the measles vaccine, the CDC said in a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-vaccine-cdc-texas-kansas-travel/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;letter to health departments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this week, marking the first time in years that the CDC has published these kinds of vaccination recommendations for domestic travel within the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current increase in measles cases in the United States is due to people returning to the United States from international trips with measles and an expanding outbreak among communities with low vaccination coverage in Texas and other states," the CDC wrote in its letter.&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s not the only type of allergy threat getting worse with warming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are other allergens, like &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92178-z"&gt;mold spores&lt;/a&gt;, whose spread coincides with higher temperatures and weather disruption. But one of the most insidious and underrated dangers is now coming from &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39755273/"&gt;stinging and biting insects&lt;/a&gt;. These wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, and bees are showing up in new areas and in greater numbers as more places become suitable for their hives, nests, and colonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Insect allergies are much less common than pollen sensitivity across the population, but they can cause severe, deadly complications, and they are far less studied. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7227a6.htm"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, on average, 72 people in the United States died from insect allergies per year over the past decade. But insect allergies send &lt;a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/insect-sting-allergies/"&gt;thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; to the emergency room every year, and millions of people live with the fear that the next insect that lands on them could ruin their day. “From a public health point of view, it’s been heavily underserved,” said &lt;a href="https://annualmeeting.acaai.org/2024/conference_schedule.cfm?speakerCRMKey=5DD7EC8A-31F2-4849-8595-60032B1C2520&amp;amp;shared=true"&gt;David Golden&lt;/a&gt;, an allergy researcher and part-time faculty at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The result is that many people are experiencing allergic reactions from insects for the first time, sometimes unsure of where they’re coming from. Many doctors are also unaware of how to diagnose and treat insect allergies. And as the climate changes, the allergy threat from arthropods is likely to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-insect-allergies-are-on-the-rise" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why insect allergies are on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Changes in the climate are making the world more welcoming for insects that bite and sting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Warmer winters and earlier springs mean more critters like yellow jackets and hornets survive the cooler seasons and emerge early in the year in greater numbers. And as temperatures continue to rise, previously inhospitable parts of the country are becoming habitable for insects, allowing species like fire ants to migrate further north. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-navigate-our-buggier-world" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to navigate our buggier world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Allergies from stinging insects are getting worse as the climate changes, but there are some things you can do to keep your symptoms manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Reduce skin exposure with shoes, socks, and long sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Inspect the grass, shrubs, and nooks around your home for nests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Most insect repellent products don’t work on the most worrisome stinging insects, so it’s best to avoid the places where they live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Some pain, redness, and itchiness after a bite or sting is normal, but you should &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/allergies/types-of-allergies/insect-allergy/"&gt;get medical help&lt;/a&gt; if you experience larger rashes, dizziness, trouble breathing, swelling around the mouth, or stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;• Talk to an allergy specialist if you suspect you have an insect allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;• If you are allergic, develop a treatment plan and an emergency plan with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s bad news for the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/insect-allergy"&gt;3 percent of adults and 1 percent of children&lt;/a&gt; who have insect allergies. Stinging insect venom in particular is notorious for causing &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anaphylaxis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351468"&gt;anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, a life-threatening allergic reaction where blood pressure plummets and airways swell, making it difficult to breathe. And most people don’t know that they’re allergic until they’ve been bitten or stung. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Golden explained that there are three broad categories of insects that concern allergy specialists: bees, wasps, and ants. People who have insect allergies are not necessarily allergic to all of them, and even within these groups, someone can react to one variety but not another. There are treatments such as immunotherapy that can protect an allergy sufferer from insect sting complications, but they often provide relief from the bite of just a specific kind of insect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That was evident in Europe in recent years with the arrival of the invasive &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-jersey-46029832"&gt;Asian hornet&lt;/a&gt;. “They were reporting that even people who were known to be allergic to yellow jackets and hornets were getting the allergy shots — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8734599/"&gt;venom immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; — to protect them and they were stung by yellow jackets and hornets and they were fine,” Golden said. “But when they got stung by this Asian hornet, they had anaphylaxis all over again. It’s another allergy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/fire-ant-allergy"&gt;fire ants&lt;/a&gt; are also a major concern for allergy sufferers. This is an aggressive, hardy invasive species that took root in the warm climate of the southern and southeastern US, but is gradually moving northward. Their range now reaches &lt;a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/news/climate_change/how-climate-change-is-fueling-virginia-s-fire-ant-invasion/article_21bb5462-6abb-11ea-8abf-1b6d11e8354b.html"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, and they sporadically pop up in &lt;a href="https://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/01glance/wildlife/insects/html/invasive.html"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Strictly speaking, ticks are not insects, but they are also moving further north as the climate warms. The spread of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/climate-change-fueling-increase-of-lone-star-tick-sightings-in-minnesota/"&gt;lone star tick&lt;/a&gt; is particularly concerning because it can trigger a dangerous allergy condition known as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alpha-gal-syndrome/about/index.html"&gt;alpha-gal syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. When the tick bites a host, it transmits a sugar that makes victims &lt;a href="http://v"&gt;react to red meat&lt;/a&gt; like beef, pork, and lamb, as well as products made from mammals. Climate change is also helping spread the ticks that carry &lt;a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1307799"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="alaska-is-a-window-into-the-future-of-seasonal-allergies" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Alaska is a window into the future of seasonal allergies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of these factors are converging in America’s largest state, which is warming up to &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/alaska-and-changing-climate"&gt;three times faster than the global average&lt;/a&gt;. And since the climate there is starting from such a cold baseline, many residents are encountering allergy triggers for the first time the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We did a study that showed the further north you went, the higher the prevalence of people seeking health care, urgent care for stinging events,” said Jeffrey Demain, an allergist in Anchorage, Alaska, and clinical professor at the University of Washington. “With milder winters, you have more survival of the hibernaculum, so the queens, they come out in the spring, and they’re already impregnated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Alaska is also getting walloped hard by pollen and mold. “Birch pollen levels can become incredibly high here,” Demain said. “In fact, we oftentimes are the highest in the world. We kind of trade off between Finland, Sweden, and Alaska as far as who has the highest levels.” Sensitivity to pollen can also trigger reactions to certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts, a phenomenon known as &lt;a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/allergic-conditions/food/pollen-food-allergy-syndrome/"&gt;pollen food allergy syndrome&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/oral-allergy-syndrome-(oas)"&gt;oral allergy syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. And as warmer air moves in, there’s a growing shift from snow to rain, as well as an &lt;a href="https://www.uaf.edu/news/alaskas-changing-environment-new-report.php"&gt;increase in intense rain events&lt;/a&gt;. More rain means more humidity, which means more mold, which in turn causes major problems for buildings in Alaska built to insulate against the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are other environmental threats mixed into all this as well. Alaska has seen an &lt;a href="https://www.frames.gov/afsc/ACWE"&gt;increase in large wildfires&lt;/a&gt; in recent years and is &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northwest/topic/climate-change-and-wildfire-alaska"&gt;projected to burn more&lt;/a&gt; as average temperatures rise. These fires send huge clouds of smoke and ash into Alaska’s cities, towns, and villages. “Even though that might not be in your immediate area, it causes a tremendous amount of pollution, and the particulates in the air can travel long, long distances,” Demain said. The degraded air quality can irritate airways and &lt;a href="https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/wildfire-smoke-and-your-health/"&gt;make people more susceptible to allergens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It shows that allergies don’t exist in a vacuum and that climate change can create health problems that intersect and exacerbate each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Looking at allergies alone doesn’t tell the whole story about the magnitude of the threat. It also shows that it’s essential to slow the underlying changes to the climate by reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in order to tamp down on the dangers of future allergies and related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPdkNVM001MlNVaHgxQXZiMWFlOXNFSkZGejJEVjUtWHlvdlY5MHNxUXlISGIyY1I0TmdmeEl3b3hkbUV3Nlh1anRaTVhmZU8zdkZ1VmhzX0NJbi1lSlR0LXExd1pLR0E4SHE0SVJXNER0NDBkX1pSdXFEdEs1NlBWSV9aMDhBdw</guid></item><item><title>Measles outbreak now totals over 600 cases in three states; El Paso County reports cases - Dallas News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOeXdXWFZIa1hmYWV0UHlMUVdpT2RUT3A4SE1vV3RHT0tMNl9BLTlrbnpVRmliXzA0X21RVlY3dktYUGtQbHVocDFFZWVKeHBxUHVsbE9aQTU1bVdac00xYkJhU3RHdFVELVVEdmwyWXlOOWh6c1ZKOWloYXBqVHdKMjFxdFRxelJHZUZPbFFNeFJhOUtDWXRoZnJmeHJkOG5SQjZRSlpJTFpMcGk5VmVlUzRBaUxERC1qa3NvMUIyQ1d6QmNWQUFMYXJ2Um1sU2QzcTBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Texas’ &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/04/08/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-to-more-than-500-cases/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/04/08/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-to-more-than-500-cases/"&gt;measles case count&lt;/a&gt; jumped again, new data showed on Friday, with an additional 36 cases reported in the prior three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The state &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;has now reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 541 measles cases in the ongoing outbreak that began in West Texas in January, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The outbreak has spread to an additional county as well. El Paso County has reported three cases as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The state public health department estimates about 5% of the total cases are “actively infectious” at this time.

&lt;p&gt;The United States continues to have the highest &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/17/us-maternal-mortality-hits-highest-rates-since-1965-report/"&gt;maternal mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; among wealthy nations — and new research suggests the crisis is deepening. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832320?guestAccessKey=601c54f6-1301-480b-a5cc-38ece562efb7&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=040925" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published this week in JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt; found that the rate of these “largely preventable” deaths rose by nearly 28% between 2018 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The concerning rates in the US should be an urgent public health priority,” wrote the study authors, who also identified a disturbing gap between states when it comes to maternal deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The rate of pregnancy-related deaths hit its peak during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;mikumistock – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;An alarming rise in maternal deaths&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, using CDC data, focused on health issues during pregnancy and up to one year after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of more than 18 million live births that took place over the four year study period, researchers identified 6,238 pregnancy-related deaths among women ages 15 to 54.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, nearly a third of those deaths happened more than six weeks after childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Late maternal death occurs in what could be a health care delivery gap between &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/01/us-news/new-york-employers-must-now-offer-paid-medical-leave-of-at-least-20-hours-for-prenatal-care-during-pregnancy/"&gt;obstetric care&lt;/a&gt; and transition to primary care,” the study authors noted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crisis in the South &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the Southeast, the news is especially bleak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These states had the highest rate of pregnancy-related deaths nationwide from 2018 to 2022, with Alabama topping the list at 59.7 deaths per 100,000 live births. Mississippi took second place. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Death rates varied more than threefold between states. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, California had the lowest rate in the US. at 18.5 deaths per 100,000, followed by Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, researchers said that if every state matched California’s number, more than 2,679 deaths could have been avoided over the four year stretch.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Young moms hardest hit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that the rate of pregnancy-related deaths rose from 25.3 per 100,000 live births in 2018 to a peak of 44.1 in 2021, coinciding with the height of the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/23/pregnant-women-share-what-its-like-to-be-expecting-during-coronavirus-pandemic/"&gt;coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The rate then fell slightly to 32.6 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the increase in deaths occurred across all age groups, women aged 25 to 39 experienced the most significant rise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease — the number one cause of pregnancy-related deaths overall — played a major role in the spike, &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/rose-molina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Rose L. Molina&lt;/a&gt;, one of the study’s authors, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/health/maternal-death-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Common complications of pregnancy include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and infections. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AntonioDiaz – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;She explained that pregnancy puts extra stress on the heart and can worsen hidden or existing conditions like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/10/health/i-scary-preeclampsia-heres-what-other-moms-should-know/"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/29/health/heart-disease-risk-higher-for-women-who-have-these-unhealthy-lifestyle-habits/?utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; itself is becoming more common in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We seem as a society to be getting sicker earlier, which is why we’re seeing this in that particular age group,” said Molina, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other leading culprits that fueled the rising death toll include &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/30/pregnant-women-face-cancer-risk-from-chemicals-in-most-household-products/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/16/number-of-pregnant-women-with-depression-rises-sharply/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; issues, substance abuse and alcohol. The study did not include accidents, homicides or other deaths not medically linked to pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The racial and ethnic divide&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In addition to the state-by-state disparities, researchers also identified widening gaps in pregnancy-related deaths among different races and ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Native American and Alaskan Native women faced the highest rates, followed by Black women.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The study authors said this suggests that “these groups may face disparities in access to postnatal care, as well as other socioeconomic and systemic challenges impacting maternal health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, pregnancy-related deaths were lowest among White, Hispanic and Asian women.&lt;/p&gt;

Diet is one of the most common and modifiable (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jasper Senff, lead study author and post-doctoral fellow at the Singh Lab at the Brain Care Labs, said: 'Dementia, stroke, and late-life depression are connected and intertwined, so if you develop one of them, there's a substantial chance you may develop another one in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And because they share these overlapping risk factors, preventive efforts could lead to a reduction in the incidence of more than one of these diseases, which provides an opportunity to simultaneously reduce the burden of age-related brain diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review was published earlier this month in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/21/jnnp-2024-334925"&gt;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp;amp; Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers analyzed 37 articles. Of those, 36 were on stroke, 16 were on dementia, and two were on late-life depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then combined the data to identify modiable risk factors, or those that can be altered with behavioral changes, shared by at least two of the three diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 17 risk factors associated with at least two of the diseases were: blood pressure, kidney disease, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, alcohol use, diet, hearing loss, pain, physical activity, purpose in life, sleep, smoking, social engagement, and stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, the team found high blood pressure and severe kidney disease had the greatest impact on incidence and burden of stroke, dementia, and late-life depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure damages blood vessels in the brain, limiting blood flow to areas like the brain. This causes brain cells to die, resulting in dementia, particularly vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also a leading cause of stroke due to this blood vessel damage, as blood vessels become more prone to blockages. Elevated blood pressure also weakens the inner lining of the arteries, causing plaque to build up and clots to form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, high blood pressure can cause inflammation in the brain, which is thought to increase the risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kidney disease, on the other hand, prevents the body from filtering out harmful toxins, which can damage brain cells and arteries, leading to dementia, stroke and late-life depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kidney disease, which is treated with dialysis (pictured here), raises the risk of dementia through toxins building up in the body and damaging blood vessels and brain cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cognitive activities like puzzles and card games had the lowest association with dementia, though experts noted this could be because people with dementia have a more difficult time completing cognitive tasks in general (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physical activity and leisure time cognitive activity, such as completing puzzles, were associated with the lowest risk of brain disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers suggested these associations may be 'symptomatic rather than causal,' as people with brain disorders like dementia may be less capable of exercising or doing puzzles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure, diet and physical activity were the three risk factors shared by all three diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also looked at more 'overlooked' factors like fulfillment in life, hearing quality, and pain sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emerging evidence suggests having a purpose in life can protect against changes in the brain that lead to dementia, such as brain cell death and a buildup of toxic proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high quality of life also reduces the risk of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hearing loss has also been shown to cause cognitive strain and prevent social interactions, which add stress to the brain and can increase dementia and stroke risk. That lack of interaction may also influence depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic pain has also been shown to lead to depression, as it can be limiting, and it can attack areas of the brain responsible for cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sanjula Singh, senior study author and principal investigator at Brain Care Labs at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-76561fd0-16db-11f0-aaaa-878b77cdf851"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; General Hospital, said: 'Our study identified 17 modifiable risk factors shared between stroke, dementia, and/or late-life &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-764f1af0-16db-11f0-aaaa-878b77cdf851"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, emphasizing that there are many different steps individuals can take to lower their risks for these age-related brain diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, such as relying only on existing reviews, meaning other risk factors may have been missed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Medics have warned one sex position could be responsible for up to half of all penile fractures, an eye-watering injury that can leave men in agony&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of those being rushed to hospital was 44, though the oldest patients were in their late 70s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2015 &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/768158"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;by researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/brazil/index.html" id="mol-c9fea290-16e7-11f0-9bbc-e71d829dfe81" class=""&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; found that sexual positions where women were on top resulted in half of all penile fractures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was followed by positions involving the woman on all-fours, which were responsible for 29 per cent of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the safest position in the bedroom was revealed as the man-on-top or 'missionary position'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The reverse cowgirl can pose dangers, in some cases, the penis can be injured if you're a little too enthusiastic with the thrusting,' sex and relationship expert Annabelle Knight told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/most-dangerous-sex-position-reverse-cowgirl-094836-20240227"&gt;LadBible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If this is the case there's a risk that the penis can fall out and then be sat on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But fear not, because as long as you and your partner keep an open dialogue, take your time, and embrace sensuality, then this position shouldn't give you too much trouble.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other studies have suggested that reverse cowgirl is not actually the most dangerous intimate arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.scielo.br/j/ibju/a/V9WQsVvbC6rnNF8CP8LfJtg/?lang=en"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;of nearly 500 men who suffered a penile fracture in East &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-c9fe2d60-16e7-11f0-9bbc-e71d829dfe81"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; found that positions where the man was on top actually caused the most number of injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team theorised: 'that when a man is dominant and very excited, intercourse may become highly vigorous and [cause] impact trauma.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a man to get an erection, two spongy tubes called the corpora cavernosa fill up with blood and harden. These are surrounded by a fibrous lining, known as tunica albuginea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fracture occurs when these areas rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of a penile fracture, in addition to the aforementioned popping or cracking sound, include, unsurprisingly, a great deal of pain and sudden loss of an erection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the circumstances of a penile fracture can be embarrassing this shouldn't delay victims seeking immediate medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because delays increases the risk of complications including erectile dysfunction, abnormal penis shape, medically called Peyronie's disease, and pain during future erections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery is normally required to fix penile fractures with a medic stitching the tunica albuginea back together and repairing any other affected tissues like the urethra, the tube urine passes through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 16:08:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxObHR0RlRkNUlEcHN6RTkyQURZd1NpeWRPcllldmdHbldKY0pObUFhY1JGV0lnRnlUSHhBMm1sLURMTG9hODZQdFhzSjJuTlg4dU9WWEpmcjNTUmVjTl9mT1cyN1U5NGxjM1JQSU40NFNxMloxMWJJRlpIOUFrUlg1M0wybTlIU3RaUF9iTWZwSWV5dHNzdktlN9IBngFBVV95cUxPYzhCR0RYRGVKQVYtdHFqTloza05lTEV6M3hwVmhNUTlSWW1VT1dpZXlmRGJRZHNSdEM0R2t1bG0wWXVOdzd6ZjNWNFV0RVJnVVBqcVBGSTRVYlBvRW5ocHNabnBFUjI2YldwaGIzNXlxMjhQRUdScGJaSjR0dlRLeUdVVTJFalFIYjFwNzdpZ3Q4LUVrVkVJZWs4T0pIZw</guid></item><item><title>Video captures woman having stroke on TikTok Live: 'One of the scariest things' - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE81cVdKQ3I2MldLSk9XeHMwcGNqUUlVQ1hzV29NTWxSU2NMSXBVaXZUMElZWUdDQm5tTExnQjRmLWtPSEFKVEhCUG14SnpYdnFCWV9Lb2syZk9WQzE4UzlEQWczVmsxSW5NOWNQc3QxNEFHdlZlekVfZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kristie Kaluza started &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fizzle_jizzle/video/7459601713620847918?_r=1&amp;amp;_t=ZP-8vQZ23B78Wd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a TikTok livestream;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a TikTok livestream&lt;/a&gt; to advertise some jewelry, she suddenly felt as if she fainted. But she remained awake and upright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t fall. I wasn’t on the floor, but I realized I had dropped the jewelry, and my brain was really confused,” Kaluza, 43, of El Campo, Texas tells TODAY.com. “I look up at the camera because I knew my husband was (watching), and I tried to say, ‘I need help,’ and it wouldn’t come out. I couldn’t turn my body. I felt super heavy. I couldn’t really lift my arms.” Her husband recognized that his wife was having a stroke and called 911. But when she got to the hospital, staff didn’t consider that she’d had a stroke at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people at the hospital ... said, ‘You’re so young,’” she recalls. “I come to find out when we finally get to the neurologist … it was a stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kristie Kaluza, 42, suddenly couldn't speak or move during a TikTok live.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An unexpected stroke&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 10, 2025, Kaluza returned home in the early evening and prepared for a TikTok Live to sell her jewelry. She had a normal Friday until she sat down in front of the camera and started feeling strange. When she tried to speak, she couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a miscommunication, a misfire there somewhere, and I couldn’t get out that, ‘Hey I don’t feel good,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, her husband rushed in and recognized the signs of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘I knew then something was not right,’” Kaluza says. “If he hadn’t have looked down when he did and seen that I dropped the jewelry and I wasn’t acting right, I wouldn’t have been able to call out for help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after he called 911, Kaluza started experiencing tremors in her head and hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was one of the scariest things, not being able to say my words and not having control of my head or my hands,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bradley Kaluza, her husband, knew the signs of stroke because his mother recently experienced one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Stroke Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Stroke Association&lt;/a&gt;, the signs of stroke, which spell out FAST, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kaluza arrived at the nearby hospital quickly, it didn’t have an MRI machine, so she couldn’t undergo the scan to see if she’d had a stroke. Her CT scan looked normal, but doctors transferred her to another hospital so she could get an MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that hospital wouldn’t perform an MRI because she has a spinal cord stimulator implanted in her back to relieve pain, and they worried it would be unsafe in the MRI, she says. She had the remote to put it in MRI safety mode with her, but they still refused, Kaluza adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital injected her with a blood-thinning medication, which can break up a blood clot. She was released and underwent an outpatient MRI. The doctor who performed it determined what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The neurologist says, ‘Well, we see in the MRI with the contrast you had a stroke,’” Kaluza says. “My husband says, ‘Wait, you are saying she had a full-blown stroke?’ And the neurologist said, ‘Yes, she did have a small one.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, she’d experienced a transient ischemic attack, also known as a mini stroke, which occurs when the blockage of blood flow to the brain is brief and doesn’t cause lasting symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/transient-ischemic-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20355679" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurologist sent Kaluza to a cardiologist to understand why she had a stroke at a young age. After a variety of tests, she learned she had a hole between the upper chambers of her heart, what’s known as a patent foramen ovale (PFO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A PFO is something we all have when we’re in our fetal development,” Dr. Daniel Hermann, director of structural cardiology at Memorial Hermann Memorial City, who treated Kaluza, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, “probably about 90-95%,” the hole closes, he says. For the remaining patients, the hole remains open. Most people are unaware of it and live a symptom-free life. But in some, like Kaluza, that opening allows a clot to pass through and cause stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For 43 years, I’ve lived with the hole in my heart and never knew, never had any symptoms,” Kaluza says. “Just a hole in (my) heart from being born caused a stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PFO treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people might experience migraines from a PFO, most people have few signs that they have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something you have symptoms from,” Hermann says. “It causes no structural issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When younger patients, people typically under 60, experience stroke, doctors sometimes find a PFO as the cause. Patients can take blood thinners to reduce clots, but that can cause people to bleed excessively if they injure themselves, for example. Doctors like Hermann often perform an outpatient procedure to fix the PFO instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the last decade or so, it’s become clear that the most effective way of reducing stroke risk related to a PFO is actually closing it,” he explains. “That’s typically done using a catheter-based approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the minimally invasive procedure, a doctor threads a catheter through a vein in the groin and inserts a “small plug” into the catheter, which they use to block the opening between the heart chambers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not something that typically takes too much time and it’s something that’s very effective as far as closing the hole and preventing further strokes,” Hermann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaluza should be able to do everything she enjoys without any worry of a future stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Her risk of stroke after having this taken care of it essentially returns her back to any other person … that is of her age,” Hermann says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Raising awareness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Kaluza underwent her PFO closure on March 4, she has been feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can do everything that I could do before,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she struggles cognitively at times, and she can’t find the right words or says in the wrong order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When my brain works a lot … it starts to get tired,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes Kaluza wonders what would have happened if her husband didn’t see she was having a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(It’s) very, very scary,” she says. “I don’t know how long I would have sat here not being able to move and not being able to call out (for help).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaluza hopes that her story encourages others to act quickly if they see someone experiencing stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew what to look for and we called and got help quickly,” she says. “That’s what I want people to learn, how to look for stroke, what to do, how to get help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 15:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE81cVdKQ3I2MldLSk9XeHMwcGNqUUlVQ1hzV29NTWxSU2NMSXBVaXZUMElZWUdDQm5tTExnQjRmLWtPSEFKVEhCUG14SnpYdnFCWV9Lb2syZk9WQzE4UzlEQWczVmsxSW5NOWNQc3QxNEFHdlZlekVfZg</guid></item><item><title>The Power (and Pitfalls) of a High-Protein Diet - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPLTlESUdWczJjUVd4YjJvWGF2RmxNMUxUR2JiMEdhT0VsejJCVjV3M1BtTzZPNjJWamJOVFFvNVN5bkVVSVl6TE8xNmdUSUhUZ0llX0RwMWEzM1Z4bUZuM25BZ1M3WExVM1FUUjM2aENMaGJDUE1pcVZvSFh5UGd3alF0RkVzeFpJbGl0MXJwZi11TmtkeDluUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

              'This is day 312 eating nothing but meat, eggs, and seafood. Today is officially week six of the carnivore diet. Whatever you think you know about protein, how much to eat, what kind to eat might be wrong. Four, six ounce tri-tip  sirloin steaks. Six scrambled eggs. Leftover butter and tallow. Always eat more protein, high protein. Typical protein is nasty.

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              There is no question about it. Protein is having a real moment, and food companies have caught onto this. That's why you're now seeing protein in everything from chips to cereal. As I think most of our listeners know by now, whenever there's some sort of health fad trending, we like to take a closer look. On today's show, we're diving into the world of what's now being called protein mania. We're gonna get you some answers to questions like, how much protein do you actually need? How much is too much? Is all protein created equal? Can you get enough protein as a vegetarian or a vegan? And I'll even give you some specific ideas for your next breakfast. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life. All right, full disclosure, I approach most trends with some healthy skepticism. But at the same time, don't get me wrong, I think a lot about protein. Protein is essential. So let me give you a few basics. Our diets are made up of three main macronutrients, protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Now, from a purely scientific perspective, we need protein and fat to survive. Carbs, less so. Now, what's so special about protein? It is the only macronutrient that supplies us with amino acids, which our bodies need to function. Amino acids help with everything from building and maintaining muscle, making hormones and neurotransmitters, boosting your immune system, even maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. So yeah, I wanna put that out there because protein goes way beyond just bulking up muscle. But there is another side to this as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I was in LA and I did some interviews there and nine out of 10 people I asked, what do you have for breakfast? It was raw eggs or protein bars or protein smoothies. It was amazing. They've been sort of brainwashed into thinking that they have to move on to protein because they're somehow deficient and they're not gonna be lean and have a six pack and be running marathons.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Today's guest is Dr. Tim Spector. He's a genetic epidemiologist, researcher, and the author of several books that have shaped the way many of us think about our diets.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Nutrition has gone from being the most boring science, and doctors never used to want to know about it, as you probably remember, to one of the most exciting topics that really we can discuss because it's suddenly caught the public's imagination. Everyone's interested in it. And in the U.S., the current trend of interest is everyone's obsessed with protein.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:12
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, we talk about nutrition quite a bit. And one of the things that struck me, Dr. Spector, when I started doing this was, I felt like people generally know how to eat well. And maybe I'm being a little too conciliatory towards this, but I think as a general rule, you should eat your fruits and vegetables. You shouldn't eat too much. You shouldn' eat too many processed foods. They know that and yet they don't. Is this a education problem? Is this an access problem? Why despite the fact that people generally know how to eat?

              'I think it's a combination of factors. I think, it's fantastic marketing by the big food companies to cloud the issue and make people think they're eating healthy foods when in fact they're not. And it's also a lack of access. You don't have to go very far in the U S to see these food deserts. Or if you're on the road, traveling through airports and railway stations, gas stations. You don't have any choice. It's like the only things to eat are rubbish ultra processed food. So it's that combination really of it being made really difficult for the average American to eat well. Plus the fact that although they know the really bad foods are bad for them, they're sort of tempted to have these other foods that have a lot of these health halos on them. unbeknownst to them, making them overeat. And I think this is where the battleground really is. It is in, it's not fighting Coca-Cola or Pepsi, it's fighting the healthier versions of them, the diet drinks, it the low-fat foods, it's the high-protein snacks that have brilliant marketing behind them, brilliant food chemists making them taste delicious and distorting that. original view that people know that fruit and vegetables are good. Ultra processed food is bad. And they think, okay, I'm getting this high protein snack bar. It says it's low in fat. Oh, I've heard that's good. It's high in protein. I've heard that even better. I'm going to buy it. And the fact that it's packed with 20 chemicals, they don't want it's going to mess up their gut. They don't know that never before in history of people being attacked on all distort what they know is true and twist it, so that the companies will use that information. Oh, this snack bar contains real fruit, right? So, oh, ting, I remember, fruit is good for me. That's one of the top three reasons people buy junk food is because they see a little signal in there to say, oh, I'm gonna buy that. A little health halo, as you call it. Yeah, and currently protein is the health halo. par excellence in the US. We like to simplify things and that's, and nothing's truer than in nutrition. That's why we reach for the magic vitamin pill or supplement while we dumb everything. A very complex science like nutrition down to a simple thing like, what am I going for this? Okay, I'm going for my protein.

              It sounds like there's two issues that you're sort of raising. One is that they're wrong and that they probably don't need to think of trying to get that much protein into their bodies, but also what they're giving up to do it. They're giving out more fruits and vegetables in search of all that.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              I'm not saying protein's bad, very little evidence. You have to take a lot of it for it to be harmful. So in general, protein is pretty good, particularly if it's plant protein, but nothing wrong with meat protein in moderation, but it's what it replaces. We need to start thinking much more holistically. And this is what I've been sort of preaching in my books is the idea that whenever you add too much of something, you can't get the rest of it. studies have shown that Americans have more than enough protein. They're getting a lot. There might be a few exceptions out there, but most people are already on twice the amount. And yet 90% of Americans are deficient in fiber. And, yet, nobody's fighting the corner of fiber, Because there's no money. There's no money in that.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And so that is this a fad, do you think, right now? Or is this something that is sort of a pendulum swing? Or is there something that we're going to see more and more of?

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, I think it's a fad until people realize that you can't store protein. So you either pee it out or it just gets converted to fat. And so if you're not spending three hours in the gym, which I guess you and I are not, then
            &lt;/p&gt;

              I can't see. You've got a very dark shirt. So you you could have huge muscles that are hidden from me at the moment. I can see that it could just be two hours, you know, I think. But I think it's in part being driven by marketing for particularly teenage boys who are into fitness and bodybuilding. There's a big craze about body awareness and muscles and protein and gyms all across all across the country. It's a bit of a zeitgeist moment that everyone's thinking about fitness. They're thinking about how do you build muscle? You've got Americans on a Ozempic. They're losing muscle when they lose fat. So they're thinking about protein for good reasons. So I think it's going to be here for a while. It's not, it's not just a few months. It appropriate with us for a few years. And I think it will settle down to people actually slowly getting ready for the truth. And they'll realize that If they've been on these high protein diets for a year or so, the rest of that other health will start to suffer.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              How much protein should we be eating? And I will tell you that I spoke to my own doctor about this recently. I do exercise every day. I'm not a big bodybuilder, but I do exercise every and he told me roughly about a gram per kilo. So a gram for roughly two pounds of weight I should be getting in protein. Does that sound right to you?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yes, I think it does. The US recommendations are actually a bit lower than that. They're about 0.83. Most countries have that, but that's really for more sedentary people. So the more exercise you're it plays to play safe. And I think for most people, a gram per kilo is about right. As you do more exercise, then it can creep up probably to a maximum. If you're a professional athlete of around 1.6 where you are doing per kilo. Yes. So it's titrating it in a way to your levels. Other people that might need more than one... people who are losing weight. So if you're losing weight, you're not eating much. So the reason you just need one is you're eating a reasonable amount of food and people who eat a reasonable food, whether they choose to or not, are going to get protein. You get protein just from eating spaghetti. It's in wheat, it's in corn, it it's in things that you don't necessarily think about, not just eggs and meat. you're eating a lot, you will be getting plenty of protein for you. But if you're not, you're on a diet or you're sick or you are losing weight, you'll need extra amounts. It's complicated. There are people out there on social media saying you need over two grams per kilo, which is crazy amounts. That means you'll be eating over 50% of all your food as protein. and it's virtually impossible to eat that it makes you very sick and nauseous to actually have that much protein as well. Anything at excessive levels mean that all your nutritional scores from any new any proper nutritionist would score them very badly.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So that's roughly for the US audience. So it's roughly 2 pounds, 2.2 pounds and a kilo. So you're saying roughly half a gram of protein per pound.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So if you weigh 150 pounds, 75 grams, 200 pounds, 100 grams of protein a day.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah. And that's, that's being generous because it's, it's slightly under half. So it's it works out that way. So most people don't have to worry that they're already getting more than enough. And partly this is because the Americans eat more meat than virtually any other country in the world, twice the European average. So they're getting a lot of protein already. And it's in a lot ultra processed foods as well through soybeans and are the things that people don't think about.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              'Okay, let's take a short break here. When we come back, I'm gonna ask Dr. Spector if where we get our protein matters, meaning whether you're plant-based or a carnivore. Dr. Spector has mentioned a couple of times that most of us aren't getting enough fiber, and he's definitely right about that. Federal guidelines call for adult men to get around 28 to 34 grams of fiber for women between 25 to 28 grams. For some context, that's roughly the amount of fiber in a can of black beans. Now, if you are looking to get more fiber, one thing that you're probably doing is turning to plants. But, can plants help us meet our fiber goals? and at the same time, our protein goals. I asked Dr. Spector, are all proteins created equal? You mentioned soy, for example, so soy versus a piece of meat.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              'Meat and eggs have pretty much the perfect balance of the amino acids for your body. We have these proteins made up of these building blocks, which are amino acids, and we have a certain number of them called essential ones, which we can only get through our The rest we can make in our cells and our body. And meat has the perfect balance of these, but plants have all of them. the balance in any one plant is slightly different. But if you have a range of plants, you will get the equivalent amounts and range and everything adequate as you would by having meat. But the misconception is that if you take one plant, you say like soy or you take rice or one bean, it's not going to have the perfect balance of all those amino acids. so you would, if you only yet. that one food exclusively, you might end up being deficient eventually in one of these. So that's why it's a rather strange debate, because nobody actually eats like this. If you're sensible and you're eating a varied plant diet, you don't necessarily need meat to get all the protein you need. But you do need a variety of-

              And the nice thing is that there are lots of plants that are very rich in proteins, particularly things like the legumes, most of the beans and lentils. And they have very high levels of protein in them as well. But the bonus is you're also getting fiber. So when you eat meat, which is packed with protein, you're getting no fiber. So you're not really getting things that are gonna improve your gut health, your immune system, et cetera. So it's a big misconception. it's why. The meat lobby in the US is so big that the carnivore diet people, they just say, well, plants are inferior. Well, any one plant might be, but you add them all together and they're far superior.

People forget that. really healthy fats and proteins there. Small amount of carbs. That tends to be what I eat. I tend to have meat once or twice a month and fish maybe once a week. And that's for a variety of reasons, but mainly it's the main thing I can do for the environment and the planet, which I feel we should do, but I think it's also important for my health. What I'm trying to do is give myself the room so I can have 30 different plants during my week. And that's that diversity of plants, which I think is probably the most crucial rule for nutrition. And I think a little bit of everything is probably a pretty good rule. And we shouldn't be demonizing things like saying, well, meat is deadly or proteins either good or bad, or fiber is bad for you.

For me, because of the family history of heart disease, I think I was warded off these saturated fat oils. That was something that just became part of my way of life. I'm not somebody who cooks with a lot of butter, for example, or certainly we don't use beef tallows.

And I'm not an expert in the air, but I work with a colleague called Dr. Sarah Berry, who is a world expert in fats and health. And I listened to what she says, and she says there is no real evidence that seed oils are bad for you. high quality human clinical trials. All the evidence is based on very poor data in animals and in test tube studies, which you can prove anything if you want to. So we should go with a big epidemiological evidence. We should go over the clinical trials, and when we do, we don't see anything particularly wrong with these seed oils. So they shouldn't be demonized in that way, but within them, there's obviously differences. You always wanna go for the higher quality ones. shouldn't just throw everything out because you've seen something on TikTok saying that they're deadly. That's just another yet another fad that's going to go. But we should be worried about getting everyone to go back to eating beef tallow. I think that is very much too much saturated fat. And there's no evidence that is good for you. Butter, I do like butter. But if you had a choice, you should cook and eat with extra virgin olive oil, because that has proven health benefits beyond any doubt. So, again, it's always a question of instead of what, which which never gets the nuance on on a 60 second TikTok, you know, it like, we're just demonizing this because of one study. done in Taiwan 10 years ago in a test tube and some big influencer is getting on their high horse about it. It's all really nonsense. So, CEDARS are not deadly, but we should be worrying about the ones that are in our ultra processed foods, the really cheap stuff, the palm oils, the eating too much coconut oil. They are the wrong side of saturated fats you should be avoiding, but. We need to react, not overreact when someone says this particular product is deadly. Usually that's wrong, but it's much more nuanced than that. And we need to rely on the experts rather than just listening to influences. So that's, but that's very hard for, it is very hard for the public though, because they're bombarded with all this stuff.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And like you said, these health halo messages and all that, people have a hard time finding sources of good information about this stuff that's based on data presented with humility, as I think you're alluding to as well. I mean, none of this is absolutely straightforward. And I notice you're not dogmatic about any of this stuff.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              No, I've changed my mind several times, and I think it's as a journey that myself and the companies are led by science. And so if a new study comes out that changes our way of thinking, we change things. And we've just got a new score coming out about ultra processed food that was used to be scored in a very crude way, just with additives. But you realize that not all ultra processed foods are bad. And some of them, just because they contain one little chemical additive. Like ascorbic acid, people were labeling it as deadly, but actually that's not true. And that's just vitamin C. And there's the biggest obstacle to health in the US is this bombardment with all this signaling about vitamins and protein and low fat and low calorie and all this. It's a minefield to work through. So I think we realize this is the time. Everyone wants to learn about nutrition. They're no longer going to their doctor. saying, I'll just do whatever he or she says. I think people want to learn themselves. So I think this is an exciting time, really, for us to change the way we think about food. And that's really my mission is just think about it differently. And I've certainly gone full circle since I was a doctor, I got it completely wrong then. And I'm very happy to keep saying I'm happy to keep making mistakes as long as I get it right again.
            &lt;/p&gt;

It later transpired she was 'really, really sick'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would feel like I have to poo, but nothing was coming out. And when it would come out, it wouldn't be formed. It would be a blob.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In light of all of these symptoms, Byrd decided to weigh herself, and that's when she discovered she had lost almost 100lbs without trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her weight had dropped from a high of 270lbs, following the birth of her son, to 198lbs. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to find out what was behind her mounting health issues, Byrd went to see her primary care doctor in May 2022, but tests - which included an abdominal ultrasound - were inconclusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was then referred to a gastroenterologist, who immediately started quizzing her about there being a history of colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-25459c90-164c-11f0-b6a3-bd51023251db"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled: 'I told [the doctor] my symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He asked me if there was anyone in my family that had colon cancer, and I told him about my uncle who had died several years prior from colon cancer. We scheduled my colonoscopy for July.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd said her worst fears came true when she woke up from the procedure - which takes up to an hour to complete - and she saw the look on her doctor's face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After frantically asking him what was wrong, Byrd was informed that she was 'really, really sick' and at that point, she remembers screaming and the medical staff rushing to get her husband, Roysi.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors revealed that they had discovered a 'pretty big' rectal mass and Byrd was then referred to an oncologist for a CT scan and MRI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These scans revealed that she had a tumor the 'size of a golf ball' and that it was stage three colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This meant the disease had spread beyond the lining of the colon and into nearby lymph nodes, but not to distant organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling how she felt about the devastating diagnosis at the time, Byrd said: 'Of course, when you hear 'cancer,' you're thinking death or that it's something that you're not going to survive. That's what I was thinking. I was 38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Byrd, pictured in 2018 before her cancer battle, hopes her story will inspire other young people to go and checked out as soon as they feel something isn't quite right with their bodies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started thinking about my son - he was only two years old, and my daughter and my husband - I don't know what life would be if God took me right now. I started praying and asking God, 'What do you need me to do?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had so many things that I wanted to still accomplish. I have to be here for my children and my husband. I had recently lost my mom and I knew how bad it felt. I know they need me. So I had to fight. I had to.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After having a surgery to remove the majority of the tumor, Byrd underwent chemotherapy in October 2022, which saw her weight plummet further to around 140lbs as she was hit by major fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also lost her appetite as the chemotherapy made 'everything taste like metal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following chemotherapy, Byrd started radiation which took her to March 2023 and she had another surgery to remove the rest of her tumor around four months later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was at that point, the medical team declared Byrd cancer-free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had a temporary ostomy bag fitted for about a year while she healed from the surgery and one more round of chemotherapy lasting for three months to ensure the disease didn't return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout her cancer journey, Byrd says her family has been her rock and her husband 'wore all of the hats when I needed him to'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she is now cancer-free, there are some side effects that will never leave her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom-of-two says: 'Even now, after having everything done and my cancer being in remission, I still have the abdominal pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I still feel like I have to go to the restroom every five minutes and nothing happens as far as my bowels moving. They say that won't ever go away for me because of where the tumor was.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd hopes her story will inspire other young people to go and checked out as soon as they feel something isn't quite right with their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends that adults who are at an average risk for colon cancer begin screening at age 45 and then receive a colonoscopy once every 10 years until age 75 if they are in generally good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for those with a family history of colorectal cancer or other risk factors, screening may need to begin as early as age 40 or even earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Byrd concludes: 'If you have a family member that had colon cancer, even if it's not in your immediate family, advocate for yourself at the doctor's office and tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm happy that I went to the doctor, and I did not wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cancer is something that you can't predict. We only have one life to live. So if my journey can help somebody else, then I'm here for it, because we all deserve to be here and enjoy life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:41:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQdXczVGNRM2V3UWk3MElfdkw2ZUZtZ19oVmdBRjltblBiZUNjOWJ3Z20zcDRyZGp0Z1hoVDl1UV9tanVBVGtMdTRuWlFjM3I5N2wxSUt1S3NYazRiaTRWaG9SN3pfTHpBOGJEdlVQcDZqMktCWmRISWE1UlkxaXM3bThKRlJTMm1nc1ItUkFuNWZ5YXBxd2lQTFI5bFdhYUpWQ0HSAacBQVVfeXFMTS1hbnRoRkZob2NjRnpyRUd6YjdUOW16YWxpVy1xY3JHczMyVmtvVlZQRTBYTHJVcGxhZ3h5aUp3WjAtaTJOZGx3dTNSQmloZFdXc2dLZHEycHg3RncyNlNDYm1HTi1YS0hnTkpBTXY0Y3IzcFNUaXE4Zzk5ZGpabUdsX21LX2FuN1pHdFo0ZFcxM2xCNEZRZi1qMjZreDFNOHhiUUFtbDg</guid></item><item><title>AAN 2025: Tavapadon offers rapid, sustained motor benefits - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPUTZqdVc4OERlc2VBT3Rudmg0U1RkTmlpcDFzRmJDR2llQUM1c1g3dmRrNGhnc3JjVTI2MDZhTzN0a1BUbUpWcHY2RjVqdXRkUUlidV9wemJOd1pXZHNnQlFQWmk1UV9sYWhxcGZ3cGpTTmJPcGpKZ3hPTVI5TjNrUThIYzRmUk4zMnVpVXUzdnUwekNod2dwTTNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavapadon, an orally available small molecule being developed for &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, was generally safe and eased motor symptoms within one month of being administered at either a fixed or flexible dose to adults with early-stage disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also reduced the risk of common side effects typically associated with similar classes of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data come from &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04201093"&gt;TEMPO-1 (NCT04201093)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04223193"&gt;TEMPO-2 (NCT04223193)&lt;/a&gt;, two Phase 3 clinical trials that tested the efficacy and safety of tavapadon compared with a placebo in adults with mild to moderate &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; who had received minimal to no previous treatment for Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer &lt;a href="https://www.abbvie.com"&gt;Abbvie&lt;/a&gt; has said it plans to &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/tavapadons-flexible-dose-eases-symptoms-early-parkinsons/"&gt;file for regulatory approval of Tavapadon&lt;/a&gt; based on the data, detailed in two oral presentations during the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) annual meeting, held April 5–9 in San Diego and online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A key unmet need in Parkinson’s disease is finding a treatment modality that can balance the good effects of dopamine stimulation while still reducing the dopaminergic side effects,” Hubert Fernandez, MD, director of the Center for Neurological Restoration at Cleveland Clinic, said during his presentation, “&lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/msa/Public/Events/AbstractDetails/61460"&gt;Efficacy and Safety of Flexible-Dose Tavapadon, an Orally Administered, Once-Daily, Selective D1/D5 Partial Dopamine Agonist for the Treatment of Early Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Extension study testing flexible dose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While TEMPO-1 and TEMPO-2 have concluded, an open-label extension, &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04760769"&gt;TEMPO-4 (NCT04760769)&lt;/a&gt;, is ongoing to test the long-term safety and efficacy of flexible-dose tavapadon. Abbvie has also sponsored &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04542499"&gt;TEMPO-3 (NCT04542499)&lt;/a&gt;, which tested tavapadon as an add-on to levodopa in people with late-stage Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; result from the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells that produce dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, that plays a key role in regulating motor control. The standard &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/"&gt;treatment for Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; typically involves levodopa, a precursor that helps replenish dopamine levels in the brain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.abbvie.com/science/pipeline.html#tavapadon"&gt;Tavapadon&lt;/a&gt; is a dopamine agonist designed to partially activate D1 and D5 dopamine receptors on nerve cells, mimicking the effects of dopamine to help alleviate motor symptoms. By selectively targeting the D1 and D5 receptors, tavapadon may also reduce the risk of side effects typically associated with broader dopamine receptor activation, which include dyskinesias — involuntary, erratic movements — as well as hallucinations and impulse control disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TEMPO-2 clinical trial involved 304 patients, with a mean age of 62.9, who had been &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; for less than three years. They were randomly assigned to receive either tavapadon or a placebo once daily for 27 weeks (slightly longer than six months).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tavapadon dose was adjusted to find the highest each patient could tolerate, from 5 mg to 15 mg once daily. The main goal was to watch for changes in a Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Parts 2 and 3 combined score, a measure of motor symptoms’ severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment with tavapadon resulted in a significantly greater decrease in the average MDS-UPDRS combined score compared with the placebo (10.3 points vs. 1.2 points). In the MDS-UPDRS, a lower score indicates less severe motor symptoms. The difference between the two groups was apparent in four weeks (about a month) and sustained until the end of the observation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Flexible dosing of tavapadon demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the motor function in early Parkinson’s patients,” Fernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most side effects were transient and mild to moderate in severity. The most common side effects were nausea, headache, and dizziness. Somnolence, a common side effect linked to activation of dopamine receptors other than D1 and D5, occurred at similar rates in the tavapadon and placebo groups. Hallucinations and impulse control disorders were reported in 4% and 2% of patients treated with tavapadon, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Fixed-dose trial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the TEMPO-1 clinical trial, which tested two fixed doses of tavapadon, 5 mg or 15 mg, or a placebo, given once daily, were outlined in the presentation, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/msa/Public/Events/AbstractDetails/61461"&gt;Efficacy and Safety of Fixed-Dose Tavapadon, an Oral, Once-Daily, Selective D1/D5 Partial Dopamine Agonist for the Treatment of Early Parkinson’s Disease,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;” by Rajesh Pahwa, MD, a professor of neurology at the University of Kansas Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial enrolled 529 patients, mean age 63.7, and as in the TEMPO-2 trial, the study’s main goal was to watch for changes in the MDS-UPDRS combined score at week 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients in the 5 mg group had an average reduction of 11.5 points, and those in the 15 mg group had an average reduction of 12.1 points in the MDS-UPDRS combined score when compared with those given a placebo. As in the TEMPO-1 trial, this difference between the two groups was observed after a month and sustained until the end of the observation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side effects were consistent with those observed in the TEMPO-2 trial. Hallucinations were reported in 6.2% of participants receiving the 15 mg dose, but none in the 5 mg group. Rates of somnolence were comparable across both treatment groups and the placebo. Dyskinesias occurred in 1.7% of participants on the 15 mg dose, with no cases reported at the 5 mg dose. Impulse control disorders occurred in 0.6% and 1.1% of those in the 15 mg and 5 mg groups, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the efficacy of both doses was similar, the side effect profile was slightly higher in the 15 mg group. “Looking at our study, I would say the 5 mg shows the best efficacy and the side effect profile,” Pahwa said. However, he noted, the trial was not designed to directly compare the two doses, but rather to evaluate each against a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are encouraged by the positive results from the TEMPO-1 and TEMPO-2 trials, which highlight tavapadon’s potential as a novel, once-daily oral treatment for early Parkinson’s disease,” Pavnit Kukreja, therapeutic area lead, Parkinson’s, at Abbvie, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;Parkinson’s News Today&lt;/em&gt;. “The significant improvements in motor symptoms … support tavapadon’s efficacy and its favorable safety profile, aligning with our commitment at AbbVie to advance meaningful treatment options. As we progress towards our goal of submitting a New Drug Application, we remain dedicated to addressing the diverse needs of the Parkinson’s community at every stage of their journey.”&lt;/p&gt;

            A genetically engineered pig kidney helped Towana Looney enjoy 130 days without the need for dialysis before the organ was removed last week. It’s the longest a human has ever lived with a pig organ,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;marking another step forward in the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation, or the practice of transplanting animal organs into humans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00043b6mkxerxdbn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney, a 53-year-old-woman from Alabama, had been on dialysis for nine years before she received the pig kidney transplant in late November, becoming only the &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/9teig" target="_blank"&gt;third person&lt;/a&gt; to receive a kidney from a gene-edited pig while alive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00053b6mg4h29mw0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She left the hospital 11 days after surgery at NYU Langone Transplant Institute, staying at an apartment near the hospital so she could get checkups every day. But medical complications developed after months of stability, leading to the difficult decision to remove the organ on April 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00063b6m0c7hbs89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In early April, she had a reduction in renal function due to acute rejection. What triggered the rejection episode after a long period of stability is being actively investigated, but it followed a lowering of her immunosuppression regimen to treat an infection unrelated to the pig kidney,” Dr. Robert Montgomery, director of the NYU Langone Transplant Institute and chair of NYU Langone Health’s surgery department, said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00073b6m9oambug9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decision was made by Ms. Looney and her doctors that the safest intervention would be to remove the kidney and return to dialysis rather than giving additional immunosuppression. This preserves future possibilities for transplantation for her as knowledge and innovations progress,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00083b6mgig5vddw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            United Therapeutics Corporation, the biotech company that developed the modified pig kidney – known as a UKidney – celebrated the bravery and enthusiasm Looney has shown throughout the xenotransplantation journey.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9cox7ur00003b6mvmz3si5d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the biggest challenges for transplant recipients – human-to-human or pig-to-human – is the prevention and management of infections while simultaneously balancing the level of immunosuppression medications required to prevent rejection, especially in the first months after surgery,” the company said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9cp465400033b6mfrqhvyiy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We will learn more about the circumstances that led to removal of the UKidney, but current evidence suggests that the UKidney functioned well up until the time of rejection, which appears to have occurred due to a reduction in immunosuppression while treating infection unrelated to the xenokidney,” they said. “We expect physicians at NYU will share their findings in a peer-reviewed publication in the future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz00093b6mcg7aamto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney donated a kidney to help save her mother’s life in 1999 but later developed kidney failure after her remaining kidney was damaged by preeclampsia, a serious pregnancy complication involving persistent high blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000a3b6mttmlsu6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After years on the waitlist for an organ transplant, she began to develop problems associated with chronic dependence on dialysis. Without a donor match, she would die – but the complications she had developed made it more difficult to find one. When she heard about the option to try a pig kidney transplantation, she jumped at the chance to try it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000b3b6mau83kefp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Without a pathway to receiving a human kidney, she decided a gene-edited pig kidney was worth a try, and a lot of people rallied around her decision, including her husband and family,” Montgomery said at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000c3b6mso9vynt5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Looney is now back home in Alabama and says she’s grateful for the opportunity she had to participate in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9btiitz000d3b6mbn6030iu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the first time since 2016, I enjoyed time with friends and family without planning around dialysis treatments,” she said in a statement. “Though the outcome is not what anyone wanted, I know a lot was learned from my 130 days with a pig kidney – and that this can help and inspire many others in their journey to overcome kidney disease. I remain thankful to all of the doctors and researchers at NYU Langone for all they are doing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            More than 90,000 people in the United States are on the waitlist to receive a kidney transplant, according to &lt;a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/national-data/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, accounting for the vast majority of people waiting to receive an organ donation. The average wait time for a kidney is &lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/kidney-transplant-waitlist#:~:text=Once%20you%20are%20on%20the%20transplant%20waiting%20list%2C%20you%20may,Where%20you%20live" target="_blank"&gt;three to five years&lt;/a&gt; at most centers, and about 13 people die each day &lt;a href="https://unos.org/media-resources/releases/over-30-kidney-donors-and-advocates-to-celebrate-world-kidney-day-from-the-top-of-mount-kilimanjaro/#:~:text=Roughly%2013%20people%20die%20each,as%2075%20through%20tissue%20donation." target="_blank"&gt;waiting&lt;/a&gt;.

            Dialysis – a procedure to help remove waste and extra fluid from the blood – can be helpful in the short term but can do only 10% to 15% of what a &lt;a href="https://www.kidneyfund.org/treatments/dialysis#:~:text=It%20helps%20your%20body%20remove,what%20a%20normal%20kidney%20does." target="_blank"&gt;healthy kidney&lt;/a&gt; does, and people on dialysis have a 50% chance of dying in the five years after they start the treatment, &lt;a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/kidney/need/statistics#:~:text=After%20one%20year%20of%20treatment,about%2080%25%20after%205%20years." target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.

            The US Food and Drug Administration allows doctors to transplant organs from pigs into humans under what’s commonly known as “compassionate use,” which permits use of an experimental therapy or procedure if “comparable or satisfactory” options aren’t available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Pigs’ organs are similar to humans’, and the speed of pigs’ reproduction means their organs can be procured quickly. Scientists can edit the genes of the pig to reduce the risk that a human body will reject its organ.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Looney was the first to receive a kidney with 10 gene edits, and United Therapeutics &lt;a href="https://ir.unither.com/press-releases/2025/02-03-2025-120011819" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in February that it was cleared by the FDA to use this type of pig kidney in the first human clinical trials to study xenotransplantation. The company says they are in regular contact with the FDA about this and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;expect to perform the first of six initial transplants in people with end-stage kidney disease in the middle of 2025, with the intent of expanding the trial to a total of 50 patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some experts foresee pig kidney transplant becoming an established option for patients within a decade, a major advancement that would be possible because of people like Looney.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Towana’s willingness to endeavor into the unknown to help solve the nation’s organ shortage crisis will impact many more lives after her. We celebrate her tremendous courage and sacrifice,” Montgomery said. “She lived with a pig kidney longer than any other human in history, and the field has learned a great deal from her. Her contribution has furthered the hope and promise of genetically engineered pig organs as an alternative source to human organs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            United Therapeutics echoed the same sentiment.

            “Mrs. Looney’s bravery has enabled major advancements in the field of xenotransplantation and adds to the foundational insights made possible by the contributions of other patients. Her case will continue to add to the scientific community’s understanding of xenotransplantation, from the initial transplant procedure to the post-transplant management of the xenograft,” the company said. “We keep Mrs. Looney and her family in our thoughts, and we wish her a speedy recovery.”

The findings suggest that trypophobia, a phenomenon often described as a fear of holes, may be more accurately understood as a disgust-based response aimed at avoiding disease. However, fear also plays a role, particularly in individuals most sensitive to these images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trypophobia is not officially recognized as a clinical phobia, but a substantial number of people report feeling disturbed when they see clusters of holes. These reactions can range from mild unease to intense physical symptoms, such as nausea, goosebumps, or racing heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/psychology-afraid-of-holes-evolution-may-hold-the-answer-to-trypophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;proposed two evolutionary explanations&lt;/a&gt; for why these responses occur. One theory suggests that trypophobia originates from an ancient fear of dangerous animals, like venomous snakes or insects, which often have surface patterns similar to hole clusters. According to this account, fear should be the dominant reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second theory suggests that trypophobia is a product of the behavioral immune system—a set of psychological responses that help humans avoid sources of infection. This disease avoidance account predicts that disgust, rather than fear, should dominate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although both theories have some empirical support, the emotional profile of trypophobia remains unclear. Earlier studies have not always included direct comparisons between fear and disgust, and very few have assessed both emotions in response to trypophobic, fear-inducing, and disgust-inducing images. The researchers behind the new study, led by Gaëtan Thiebaut and Patrick Bonin at Université Bourgogne Europe, sought to fill this gap by measuring how strongly people react to different types of images across both emotional dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonin is a professor of cognitive psychology at Université Bourgogne Europe and a member of the LEAD-CNRS laboratory, where he conducts research on memory and the behavioral immune system. Thiebaut holds a PhD in cognitive psychology and specializes in research on memory and pathogen avoidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a personal level, we both find it difficult to look at clusters of holes, such as a lotus flower or a wasp’s nest, without feeling uncomfortable,” the researchers explained. “In fact, when Gaëtan started to work with trypophobic images, he realized that he was trypophobic. Also, trypophobia is related to one of our favorite research topics: the behavioral immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trypophobia is a fascinating area of research that affects a relatively large number of people (on average between 9% to 18% of trypophobic individuals per study), and has evolutionary explanations that can sometimes seem surprising to the uninitiated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited 291 adult volunteers, most of whom were female university students. Participants completed an online survey in which they viewed 40 photographs divided into four categories: trypophobic images (e.g., lotus pods, wasp nests), frightening images (e.g., snakes, guns), disgusting images (e.g., mouldy food, dirty toilets), and neutral images (e.g., kitchen utensils). These photos were standardized for size and emotional characteristics, using validated norms where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each image, participants rated how much fear and disgust it elicited, as well as how difficult it was to look at the image, using a 5-point scale. The researchers used these ratings to compare emotional responses across image types and to identify participants who were particularly sensitive to trypophobic stimuli. Those with the highest discomfort ratings were analyzed separately to assess whether their emotional patterns differed from those of the broader sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the full sample, trypophobic images were rated as more disgusting than frightening. While these images were not rated as disgusting as the explicitly disgusting ones, they still triggered more disgust than fear. This was true even though trypophobic images were also seen as more frightening than neutral images, showing that both emotions are present to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the participants who reported the most difficulty viewing the trypophobic images—those in the top 10 percent of discomfort ratings—showed a different pattern. For these individuals, trypophobic images were rated as more disgusting than even the disgust-inducing images, and more frightening than the frightening ones. In other words, for the people most sensitive to clusters of holes, trypophobic images were uniquely disturbing across both emotional dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even among these highly sensitive participants, however, disgust remained the dominant emotion. This supports the idea that trypophobia is more closely linked to disease avoidance than to the fear of predators. These findings are consistent with previous work showing that people with high scores on the Trypophobia Questionnaire tend to report core and pathogen-related disgust more than moral or sexual disgust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trypophobic participants (in our study, this corresponds to participants with visual discomfort ratings when viewing trypophobia-inducing pictures above the 9th decile) feel more disgust than fear at the sight of images of clusters of holes,” Bonin and Thiebaut told PsyPost. “But above all, these stimuli are very specific for them, because they evoke even more fear than non-trypophobic fear-inducing pictures such as the images of spiders, snakes, or a person pointing a gun and more disgust than non-trypophobic disgust-inducing pictures, such as the images of surgery, dirty toilets, or moldy burgers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also help clarify why both fear and disgust can be part of the trypophobic experience. Disgust may serve to prevent contact with potential sources of infection—such as spoiled food or skin lesions—while fear may help initiate flight from a perceived threat. The fact that both emotions are activated could reflect how our minds respond to stimuli that might signal either kind of danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any study, there are limitations to consider. The sample was predominantly female and made up largely of psychology students, which may affect how generalizable the findings are to the broader population. Prior research suggests that women may be more likely than men to report trypophobia, so future studies should include more diverse samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation concerns the images themselves. The researchers selected fear and disgust images from general categories, such as weapons or hygiene-related scenes. A more targeted comparison might involve disgusting images related to skin diseases, which may more closely resemble trypophobic patterns. This could help test whether specific forms of disgust are more relevant to trypophobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will continue this type of work with a larger number of trypophobic images to examine whether there are variations in the emotions felt (disgust, fear) according to the type of trypophobic stimuli (natural elements, artefacts),” Bonin and Thiebaut said. “We also want to further test the hypothesis that trypophobia is essentially due to activation of the behavioral immune system, and is therefore rooted in our evolutionary past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218251323236" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Is trypophobia more related to disgust than to fear?

In contrast, strong spatial memory skills, such as understanding where objects are located in space, may protect against PTSD symptoms, particularly in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers surveyed over 1,000 trauma-exposed adults and students, revealing distinct roles of visual and spatial imagery in PTSD vulnerability. These findings could inform future strategies to identify and support at-risk individuals before PTSD develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vivid Visual Imagery:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong visual memory is linked to more PTSD symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; Better spatial memory may reduce PTSD symptoms, especially in men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Imagery traits could help identify those most at risk after trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baycrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trauma alone doesn’t cause posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – how we process and imagine it plays a key role, according to new research. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Baycrest study suggests that having a vivid visual imagery is linked to a greater risk of developing PTSD, in which debilitating mental health symptoms persist for more than one month following exposure to traumatic or highly stressful events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is among the largest in providing high-quality evidence of this link and examining visual and spatial imagery as distinct features of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of us are exposed to trauma at some point, but only a minority of us develop PTSD,” said Dr. Brian Levine, Senior Scientist at the Rotman Research Institute, part of the Baycrest Academy for Research and Education (BARE), and senior author on this study, titled “The Curse of Imagery: Trait Object and Spatial Imagery Differentially Relate to Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder” and published recently in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research will help us understand why some are resilient to this disorder whereas others are at risk. Our results could help improve treatments for individuals who are struggling with this disorder, improving their quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, led by Dr. Ryan Yeung, a postdoctoral fellow at BARE, 806 adults who reported having been exposed to trauma completed a series of online questionnaires about their mental health, trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, and visual and spatial imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then examined the relationship between PTSD symptoms and the strength of participants’ visual and spatial imagery. The findings were confirmed in a separate sample of 493 undergraduate students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visual imagery refers to physical features of scenes that evoke a sense of vividness, such as shapes and colours, while spatial imagery refers to the location of elements within scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main study findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A more vivid visual imagery was linked to more PTSD symptoms across age and gender.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A stronger spatial imagery was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms, although this relationship was confined to men in the undergraduate sample.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to vividly re-experience past events is usually beneficial, but our results indicate that it can make it harder to overcome the psychological after-effects of distressing or traumatic events,” said Dr. Levine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, the better you are at navigating and recognizing where things fit in space, including in the ‘space’ of your life, the less likely you are to develop PTSD.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yeung added, “Considering individual differences in these aspects of memory could help us predict who may be at risk following exposure to trauma and provide them with the necessary support as early as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future studies, the research team will examine these effects in longitudinal studies by testing paramedic students before and after occupational exposure to traumatic events. Additional studies will be conducted to determine the impact of gender and biological sex on imagery and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this PTSD and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#57393936343221243c3e7a3b363e25331735362e342532242379382530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://baycrest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baycrest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natasha Nacevski-Laird – Baycrest&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/21677026251315118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Curse of Imagery: Trait Object and Spatial Imagery Differentially Relate to Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder&lt;/a&gt;” by Brian Levine et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Curse of Imagery: Trait Object and Spatial Imagery Differentially Relate to Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagery is integral to autobiographical memory (AM). Past work has highlighted the benefits of high trait imagery on episodic AM, including faster, more detailed, and more vivid retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these advantages may come with drawbacks: Following potentially traumatic events, strong visual imagery could promote the intrusions characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, spatial imagery could schematize potentially traumatic events, countering vivid recollection and reducing distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined relationships between trait object imagery (e.g., color, shape), spatial imagery (e.g., abstract representations, locations), and PTSD symptoms in two independent samples: trauma-exposed adults (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 806) and undergraduates (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 493). As predicted, higher object imagery was associated with more PTSD symptoms in both samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher spatial-schematic processing was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms in the trauma-exposed sample, although this effect was confined to men in the undergraduate sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different forms of imagery have different—or even opposing—relationships with episodic AM that affect PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:40:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE93cHd2TmxMNlpYUFJydzVlX0NsQ0ZHS3pqYzdsUmlaNlpGMWZHb0NKRlFUY0JyY3RoWFdwTS1ORm5Dc19wbXhzVjZJdWVVaUtmVDcySTM1ZWFEdTJDdFMyZmRsVy0</guid></item><item><title>7 Foods High in Vitamin D for Strong Bones and Immune System - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBKVnNMWndJekp3elZBTHl0SVZZSnl1UXdfbGdBdjJ6bXRxUE96cV8xUllrVW04NjVzaS1oS0MxYWlpTENIWDJrRWJlYkZUc0diR0E2a1FjX2xpdFNtcVNndGJHSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods high in vitamin D are essential to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-get-enough-vitamin-d-winter" target="_blank"&gt;a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;. The fat-soluble nutrient, which is made by our bodies through sunlight or found in food and supplements, does a lot for our overall health but is something that many of us lack. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/" target="_blank"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt;, 35% of adults in the US are suffering from a &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/signs-of-vitamin-d-deficiency" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin D deficiency,&lt;/a&gt; and that can lead to a number of issues (poor immune system, risk of certain cancers, and liver and kidney disease, to name just a few).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ameliasherry.com/media" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ameliasherry.com/media"}' href="https://www.ameliasherry.com/media" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amelia Sherry&lt;/a&gt;, MPH, RD, clinical nutrition coordinator at Mount Sinai says that vitamin D content is not high in a lot of foods, but the ones that do have a lot of the nutrient are easy to incorporate into any diet. Some of the most common vitamin D-rich food include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salmon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherry lists fatty fish such as salmon as a prime source of vitamin D-rich food. According to the US Department of Agriculture, three ounces of salmon can contain anywhere from &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d"}' href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;383 to 570 international units (IU)&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient, depending on which type of salmon you choose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rainbow Trout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other fish you can turn to include rainbow trout. The USDA says that three ounces contains &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d"}' href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;645 IU&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Orange Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sherry says that you can look to fortified foods to get vitamin D. One cup of orange juice, for example, contains &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d"}' href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;100 IU&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cod Liver Oil&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil has long been recommended by experts to help with a vitamin D deficiency, as its one of the richest food forms of vitamin D you can find. According to the USDA, one teaspoon contains &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/173577/nutrients" target="_blank"&gt;450 IU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sardines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sardines are one of the healthiest fish options out there. But besides its many benefits, such as &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/sardine-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;improving brain function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/sardine-health-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;preventing hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, it is packed with vitamin D. According to the USDA, one can of sardines contains &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d"}' href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;164 IU&lt;/a&gt; of the nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/healthiest-milk" target="_blank"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; is not only rich in calcium but vitamin D as well.

While the sun won’t cause this (“If your body has adequate vitamin D, it won’t keep making it from UV light,” she says), taking too many vitamin D supplements or getting too much of it from food can increase your body’s absorption of calcium and when that happens, you might experience nausea, vomiting, irritability, muscle weakness, and fatigue. “Vitamin D is fat soluble, which means that any excess you take doesn’t get lost in urine. Extra vitamin D gets stored in the body, and too much can be toxic,” she says. So it’s imperative that you find that perfect balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much vitamin D do you need per day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-d/art-20363792" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, the recommended daily amount of vitamin D is 400 IU for babies under one year old, 600 IU for anyone under 70 years old, and 800 IU for those over 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you take vitamin D supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements are necessary if you are deficient in the nutrient, which Sherry says is common in people who have limited sun exposure and may not spend a lot of time outdoors. People with darker skin tones may also have a harder time making vitamin D from the sun alone and if you’re not eating enough vitamin D-rich food in your diet or have digestive diseases like celiac, you may need &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-tips" target="_blank"&gt;supplement help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before you buy a vitamin D supplement, she says you have to confirm that you are actually deficient in it. To confirm a vitamin D deficiency, you must take a blood test. Then a doctor or dietitian can help determine how much vitamin D you should take and for how long. So when in doubt, definitely go see a doctor to see if this is the right option for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBKVnNMWndJekp3elZBTHl0SVZZSnl1UXdfbGdBdjJ6bXRxUE96cV8xUllrVW04NjVzaS1oS0MxYWlpTENIWDJrRWJlYkZUc0diR0E2a1FjX2xpdFNtcVNndGJHSQ</guid></item><item><title>CDC officials plan for the agency’s splintering, but questions remain - Federal News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPM2luLVgwNXFEQ3ZxTFNlYTNJd2hzY2ZqYVp2RnMxLXo1LUw0RTQzSm9FTENGMmxhZW02Q0tOem9qbzhlQzZNOU5SbE4zaHMycjRSZ0M5S2pSSDFJdEJ5c0lJaXVDRmFhUnFpcGhDTXkzUllndlVEMDRpZUNoMTVvR3o4VzFnelZodnRvQ18wVnBwOWEwbldwdlJTOWRnTkxXLTRBT21HUFBaS0lobDBWZDFIdTN2RE9EUHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Entry-content u-textFormat readmore_available" id="Entry-content"&gt;

                    
                    &lt;p class="before-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — A top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told staff this week to start planning for the agency’s splintering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several parts of CDC — mostly those devoted to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; threats that aren’t infectious — are being spun off into the soon-to-be-created Administration for a Healthy America, the agency official told senior leaders in calls and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directive came from Dr. Debra Houry, the agency’s chief medical officer, according to three CDC officials who were in attendance. They declined to be identified because they weren’t authorized to talk about the plans and fear being fired if they were identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment, Houry referred The Associated Press to CDC media relations representatives. CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald acknowledged the agency is planning for possible changes but that “none of the items discussed at the meeting have been finalized, and are subject to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
 	 
	
 
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said there are “a lot more questions than there are answers right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those questions include whether the split will interrupt funding and assistance to state health departments that ultimately implement federal health policy, said Harris, who also is Alabama’s state health officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’d love to be able to give input,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officials deciding what to do with programs that lost many staffers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based CDC is charged with protecting Americans from preventable health threats. It had roughly 13,000 employees at the beginning of the year, the bulk of them in Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has embarked on a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-human-services-layoffs-restructuring-rfk-jr-ec4d7731695e4204970c7eab953b2289"&gt;dramatic downsizing&lt;/a&gt; of many federal agencies. The CDC’s headcount was slashed by rounds of early retirements and layoffs that reduced staffing by 3,500 to 4,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The layoffs targeted not just job classifications but &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hhs-cdc-fda-nih-cms-layoffs-5aba829b829d9e1a0167c4a0d968aadb"&gt;offices and programs&lt;/a&gt;. For example, everyone at the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fluoride-cdc-epa-6f4dbc64b5dc511f712a82cd2d252d76"&gt;division on dental health&lt;/a&gt; was axed, as were most workers at an office that investigates occupational diseases and promotes &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-niosh-hhs-layoffs-2bac1f36b5c6361df7cbca8843d9f01e"&gt;job safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, federal health officials are deciding how to reassemble what’s left. They have a Monday deadline to submit a reorganization plan to the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
 	 
	
 
&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-human-services-layoffs-restructuring-rfk-jr-fa4e89285e668a3939e20b6cf4c26fd4"&gt;already outlined plans&lt;/a&gt; for the new Administration for a Healthy America, which would largely focus on health problems not caused by infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl. We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic,” Kennedy said in a statement last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experts wonder whether CDC workers would have to move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has said the AHA will contain — among other things — the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the U.S. Surgeon General.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meetings this week, Houry said the new AHA agency also will likely absorb what’s left of the CDC centers devoted to birth defects, chronic conditions, environmental health, injuries, and workplace safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear if those staffers would stay in Atlanta — and that “deeply matters,” said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who studies government health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If those jobs are moved to the Washington, D.C., area, “you certainly are going to lose lots of the kinds of experts who have built lives and careers and families in and around Atlanta, many of whom I’m sure would be unable or unwilling to relocate their lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would likely mean “you are building something anew, rather than just changing reporting lines,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CDC’s remaining HIV staff would be moved to new agency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parts of CDC not being moved into the AHA would be be mainly focused on infectious diseases, with one notable exception: HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s HIV prevention staff was decimated in the layoffs, with 160 people eliminated. What’s left — the agency’s HIV surveillance and lab operations, for example — would shift to the AHA under the realignment plan.&lt;/p&gt;
 	 
	
 
&lt;p&gt;Such a change would place that CDC work under the same organizational umbrella as HRSA’s Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. That program provides outpatient care, treatment and support services to people with HIV but no health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cleaving of the CDC was proposed in Project 2025, the sweeping Heritage Foundation government-shrinking proposal that surfaced last year. That document called the CDC “the most incompetent and arrogant agency in the federal government” and proposed splitting it into two smaller agencies — one focused on disease data collection and the other more generally on public health.&lt;/p&gt;

But the good news is, naloxone, which can reverse fentanyl’s deathly effect, is now available for free in Georgia, and anyone can get it.

Using a mix of mood tracking, emotion-processing tasks, and psychological questionnaires, researchers found that probiotics began improving mood after about two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the effects were best captured through simple daily mood reports rather than traditional questionnaires. Individuals who were more risk-averse appeared to benefit most from the intervention, and probiotics did not blunt positive emotions like some antidepressants can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Probiotics reduced negative emotions without affecting positive mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; People with risk-avoidant traits experienced stronger mood improvements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Daily mood reports were more sensitive than traditional surveys for detecting changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Leiden University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research by Katerina Johnson and Laura Steenbergen published in the journal &lt;em&gt;npj Mental Health Research&lt;/em&gt; shows that taking probiotics can help reduce negative feelings. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also investigated which people benefit most from these “good” bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108611"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman's face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/probiotics-negative-emotion-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In addition, the researchers found evidence that probiotics may affect the way participants process emotional cues. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are “good” bacteria in the form of drinks or tablets that you can buy in the supermarket and are also found in foods like yogurts, fermented cheese and sauerkraut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing interest in the possibility that probiotics improve not only gut health but also mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gut–brain connection provides various routes through which bacteria in the gut can influence how we feel and behave, including via the vagus nerve, immune system and hormones,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Daily mood reports&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While animal studies have previously found promising effects of probiotics on the brain and behavior, human studies have yielded inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Steenbergen therefore used a combination of methods to capture how probiotics might influence the ability to regulate our emotions and affect our moods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included psychological questionnaires, daily mood reports and computer tasks testing how people process emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in young, healthy adults who took a probiotic (containing bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) daily for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to use daily mood reports to assess the effects of probiotics. It clearly shows that probiotics can reduce negative feelings compared to a placebo. This could mean a reduction in feelings such as anxiety, stress, fatigue or depressive tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is striking that by simply asking participants how they were feeling each day, we could detect the beneficial effects of probiotics on mood,” says Steenbergen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, the standard psychological questionnaires that are common in this field were not sensitive enough to pick up these changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;No substitute for antidepressants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that it took about two weeks for the probiotics to improve negative feelings. It takes about the same amount of time for antidepressants to work, but whereas antidepressants tend to reduce both negative and positive mood, the results showed that the probiotics only reduced negative mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be a possible benefit, although the researchers stress that probiotics should not be considered a substitute for antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who would benefit most from probiotics?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers observed the decrease in negative feelings, they were keen to explore whether they could predict who would benefit most from probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that various traits, most notably a propensity for risk avoidance, were associated with a greater effect of probiotics on mood,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers found evidence that probiotics may affect the way participants process emotional cues. The participants who received probiotics were slightly more accurate at recognizing facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Probiotics could be used in a targeted way in the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many questions remain unanswered about how exactly probiotics work and their long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps in the future probiotics could be used in a targeted way as an early intervention to reduce the chances of negative feelings progressing to mental health conditions such as depression, though more research would be needed to confirm that,” says Steenbergen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Steenbergen hope their findings will also spur other mental health researchers to include simple daily measures of mood in their studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they conclude in their paper, “In an attempt to delineate the complexity of the human brain and emotion, we cannot lose sight of asking the obvious. Sometimes the most simple questions reveal the most meaningful answers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this probiotics and emotion research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.leiden.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Katerina V.-A.

			&lt;p&gt;Having a fresh cut or sunburn on your skin when you first try a new food could increase the chances of developing an allergy to that food, suggests a new study led by the Yale School of Medicine (YSM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30491-9"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has found that food allergies are more common in people with skin disorders like dermatitis, inspiring the team to investigate this mysterious connection further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In experiments in mice, the team found that when new foods were introduced to the guts of the animals soon after damage to the skin, the mice developed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/you-can-develop-food-allergies-as-an-adult-why-are-they-on-the-rise"&gt;allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injuries boosted production of allergy-related  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="157797" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, a reaction known as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humoral_immunity"&gt;humoral response&lt;/a&gt;. It's the first time that this overreaction from biological defenses, which can cause allergies, has been shown to work across such distant parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157800" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157800" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/MiceChart.jpg" alt="Mice chart" class="wp-image-157800 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/MiceChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/MiceChart-600x367.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157800" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers used experiments on mice to highlight remote priming. (Waizman et al., &lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this study, we find that the systemic effects of skin inflammation are sufficient to initiate humoral responses to spatially uncoupled antigens, a concept that we define as 'remote priming'," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.adn0688"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know about the way allergens (substances triggering allergic responses) can take advantage of skin injuries to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2222.2005.02260.x"&gt;break into the body&lt;/a&gt; – something the researchers are terming 'local priming' in light of their new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experiments carried out here showed messenger molecules called cytokines triggering &lt;span&gt;antibody&lt;/span&gt; reactions. It seems these molecules might be a crucial first step in remote priming, sounding an alarm in the gut when the skin is breached by injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could cause the body to "blame" the distant injury on the new food, launching immune responses next time it's encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this still needs to be confirmed in humans as well as mice of course, but the researchers are keen to identify the other cells involved in turning our stomachs against certain foods – with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discovered-how-an-allergic-reaction-produces-anaphylaxis-so-quickly"&gt;potentially disastrous results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guts have evolved to be pretty tolerant when it comes to food and drink – it's easy to see why being fussy eaters can hold back a species in evolutionary terms – so if we're to understand food allergies, we need to know how this tolerance gets overridden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's a mindset change that these things don't have to happen in the same place in the body," &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/skin-injury-may-bring-on-food-allergies/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; dermatologist Daniel Waizman, from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We need to take a closer look at how these different organ systems talk to each other."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are making steady progress in understanding more about food allergies and how they affect our bodies – including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nutritionist-debunks-these-food-allergy-and-intolerance-myths"&gt;what is and isn't an allergy&lt;/a&gt; – and this latest study adds some important new insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as improving our understanding of food allergies, and potentially offering a new pathway for treating them in the future, the study also tells us more about the impact of skin injuries beyond the visible cuts, grazes, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-been-wrong-about-what-causes-sunburn-scientists-discover"&gt;and burns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To me these findings really highlight the importance of treating inflammation on the skin," &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/skin-injury-may-bring-on-food-allergies/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; dermatologist Anna Eisenstein, from YSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Treating skin disease is more than just treating what you see, but also the inflammation within and the potential for other systemic diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.adn0688"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;While healthy aging is highly individual, a healthy and balanced lifestyle can help you maximize your later years. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking soothing tea, powering down electronics and taking an after-dinner walk are simple—and accessible—ways you can support your health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s never too late (or too early) to adopt healthy aging habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us aspire to age gracefully and—more importantly—healthily. And while it can feel like many factors are out of our control, such as genetics, you have more power over &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;you age than you may think. “Your daily lifestyle habits play a big role in shaping how you feel today, and how you age in the future,” says &lt;a href="https://www.mmweightloss.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwktO_BhBrEiwAV70jXoKBmyUy87yDnB29HEqSbVUfHDtVmbiJitz6mwYcUDxFj0UIOpnDhBoC_TMQAvD_BwE" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Suneye Koohsari, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified obesity medicine and family medicine physician. “Prioritizing a balanced, healthy lifestyle can boost your energy, support mental clarity and enhance your mood, all while promoting longevity and a higher quality of life as you age.” 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s never too late to start adopting healthy habits. However, the earlier you can start making these adjustments to your lifestyle, the better. “Healthy habits formed now are the building blocks for aging,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/weight-loss-nutritionists#courtney-pelitera" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Courtney Pelitera, M.S., R.D.&lt;/a&gt; These habits can help fend off acute illnesses, such as the flu, and potentially protect against chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep is a critical component of healthy aging, which is why so many of the tips ahead focus on what you can do after 5 p.m. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7527638/how-to-sleep-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Getting quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night (preferably seven to nine hours) helps bolster the immune system, reduces chronic inflammation, improves muscle recovery and repair from exercise (and injury), and enhances cognition—just to name a few benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Take your health into your own hands with these tips from Koohsari and Pelitera.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no shortage of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044312/is-tea-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tea benefits&lt;/a&gt; or tea options to choose from. But before tucking yourself into bed, you may want to steep a cup of herbal tea such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-tea-to-help-reduce-stress-8773678" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chamomile tea&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests you may want to exclusively drink decaf beverages up to six hours before bedtime, as caffeine can disrupt sleep.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “After 5 p.m., consider sipping on chamomile tea, as it can help promote muscle relaxation and better sleep,” Pelitera says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Incorporating a walk into your after-dinner, pre-bedtime routine can be a game-changer for your overall health. Perhaps the most immediate benefit is that it supports healthy digestion, especially after a big meal, Pelitera says. “With so much new research coming out about the gut microbiome and its effects on our overall health, we now know that good digestion is essential for healthy aging,” she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Going for a walk, or doing gentle exercises like yoga, can help boost motility in your intestines, enabling them to break down food more efficiently. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Implementing a daily evening walk may provide other healthy-aging benefits too. Koohsari points out that the findings from a 2022 meta-analysis revealed that people who did light-intensity walking significantly improved blood sugar levels compared to those who didn’t take breaks from prolonged sitting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Better blood sugar regulation can help reduce the risk of developing insulin resistance over time,” Koohsari says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Mental health is a vital component of overall well-being, and finding healthy outlets to manage stress—such as journaling, deep breathing, meditation, yoga or talking with a therapist or trusted loved one—can make a meaningful difference,” Koohsari says. “Prioritizing stress management supports both your emotional resilience and long-term physical health.”

Consider also dimming the lights, playing calming music, smelling soothing essential oils and powering down electronics and other screens shortly before sleep. Research has shown that exposure to blue light, which is emitted from the sun and screens, can interfere with your sleep-wake cycle, as it suppresses production of melatonin (aka the sleep hormone).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

“Many clients I work with struggle with having to get up at night to use the bathroom, once or several times,” Pelitera says. If you struggle with this too, and you often go to bed around 10 p.m., consider enjoying a soothing cup of tea or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292203/tart-cherry-juice-benefits/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tart cherry juice&lt;/a&gt; no later than 8 or 8:30 p.m. This gives you plenty of time to use the restroom before hitting the hay.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “That being said, one of the biggest issues the aging population experiences is staying hydrated,” Pelitera says. “That’s because our sense of thirst diminishes as we age.” Throughout the day, aim to sip on at least &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;48 to 64 ounces of fluids daily&lt;/a&gt;, she adds. “Keeping a water bottle on hand and filled up can help remind you to drink it throughout the day.”

Sometimes, there’s nothing better than sipping on a glass of wine after a long workday. But, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;current evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests there’s &lt;em&gt;no &lt;/em&gt;safe amount of alcohol to consume for healthy aging. “Alcohol can negatively affect the body in multiple ways—from short-term impacts on sleep quality and mood to long-term risks such as cardiovascular disease and increased risk of cancers, including breast, colorectal and liver cancer,” Koohsari says.

A great example of this is yogurt, with or without toppings. I love adding a little peanut butter and a couple of chocolate chips to make it a sweet bite.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may not even need a snack if your dinner is rich in protein and fiber, which can help you sustain energy for evening tasks (think: chores, work, playing with kids, etc.) and help you feel full longer, Koohsari says. “Fiber-rich foods—such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains—not only promote gut health, but also improve blood sugar control, lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no one right way or strategy to promote healthy aging. In fact, there’s a multitude of ways you can promote long-term health benefits. A common thread in the many approaches to healthy aging is incorporating habits that can help encourage quality sleep. Sleep reduces inflammation in the body, which can help protect you from a host of chronic diseases. Adopting good sleep hygiene rituals and skipping that nighttime glass of alcohol are just two ways you can rest easier at night and support your overall health. “It’s not just about adding years to your life, it’s also about maximizing the number of years lived in optimal health,” Koohsari says.

&lt;p&gt;A simple blood test costing less than $10 could prevent hundreds of heart attacks and other adverse cardiac events per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troponin is a protein found in heart muscle cells that if detected in the blood stream means the heart has been damaged in some way: a key indicator of cardiovascular disease risk with greater predictive power than cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A troponin detection test that can be administered along with other simple blood tests could alert hundreds of patients to their higher risk of heart attack and stroke, allowing them to alter their lifestyle or even start taking statins, in advance of an adverse cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept was demonstrated in a paper published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The authors showed that adding cardiac troponin levels to existing risk factors such as smoking status, cholesterol, diabetes presence, and blood pressure increased the predictive powers of these screenings—done after CVD events or in advance of a statin prescription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, in their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0735109725004164?dgcid=author" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 62,000 Britons with a 15-year follow-up, one additional CVD event would be prevented for every 408 and 473 individuals screened when troponin was added, a result of troponin being a good indicator of so-called “silent” heart damage that could lead to a CVD event in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A BREAKTHROUGH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Study Finds First Evidence That Heart Muscles Can Regenerate" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/study-finds-first-ever-evidence-of-heart-muscle-regeneration-you-can-essentially-cure-heart-failure/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Study Finds First Evidence That Heart Muscles Can Regenerate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found adding troponin tests meant that up to 8% of people classified as intermediate risk were changed to high-risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Troponin, even in the normal range, is a powerful indicator of silent heart muscle damage,” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/07/simple-blood-test-help-prevent-thousands-heart-attacks-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Anoop Shah, a professor of cardiovascular medicine at the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine and lead author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As such, the test provides an extra layer of information that we can use to boost our accuracy when predicting people’s risk. We want to identify as many high-risk people as possible, so that no one misses out on the opportunity to get preventative treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.0"&gt;In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana have died of pertussis, the disease commonly known as whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.1"&gt;Washington state recently announced its first confirmed death from pertussis in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="1.2"&gt;Idaho and South Dakota each reported a death this year, and Oregon last year reported two as well as its highest number of cases since 1950.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;While much of the country is focused on the spiraling measles outbreak concentrated in the small, dusty towns of West Texas, cases of pertussis have skyrocketed by more than 1,500% nationwide since hitting a recent low in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths tied to the disease are also up, hitting 10 last year, compared with about two to four in previous years. Cases are on track to exceed that total this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;Doctors, researchers and public health experts warn that the measles outbreak, which has grown to more than 600 cases, may just be the beginning. They say outbreaks of preventable diseases could get much worse with falling vaccination rates and the Trump administration slashing spending on the country’s public health infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;National rates for four major vaccines, which had held relatively steady in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, have fallen significantly since, according to a ProPublica analysis of the most recent federal kindergarten vaccination data. Not only have vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella fallen, but federal data shows that so have those for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and polio.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;In addition, public health experts say that growing pockets of unvaccinated populations across the country place babies and young children in danger should there be a resurgence of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.1"&gt;Many medical authorities view measles, which is especially contagious, as the canary in the coal mine, but pertussis cases may also be a warning, albeit one that has attracted far less attention.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0"&gt;“This is not just measles,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor in New York City and author of the book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.” “It’s a bright-red warning light.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;At least 36 states have witnessed a drop in rates for at least one key vaccine from the 2013-14 to the 2023-24 school years. And half of states have seen an across-the-board decline in all four vaccination rates. Wisconsin, Utah and Alaska have experienced some of the most precipitous drops during that time, with declines of more than 10 percentage points in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;But statewide figures alone don’t provide a full picture. Tucked inside each state are counties and communities with far lower vaccination rates that drive outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;For example, the whooping cough vaccination rate for kindergartners in Washington state in 2023-24 was 90.2%, slightly below the U.S. rate of 92.3%, federal data shows. But the statewide rate for children 19 to 35 months last year was 65.4%, according to state data. In four counties, that rate was in the 30% range. In one county, it was below 12%.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0"&gt;“My concern is that there is going to be a large outbreak of not just measles, but other vaccine-preventable diseases as well, that’s going to end up causing a lot of harm, and possibly deaths in children and young adults,” said Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has spent her career studying vaccines. “And it’s completely preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;The dramatic cuts to public health funding and staffing could heighten the risk. And the elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, to the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, several experts said, has only compounded matters.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;The Trump administration has eliminated 20,000 jobs at agencies within HHS, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s public health agency. And late last month, the administration also cut $11 billion from state and local public health agencies on the front lines of protecting Americans from outbreaks; the administration said the money was no longer necessary after the end of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;Several city and county public health officials had to move quickly to lay off nurses, epidemiologists and disease inspectors. Some ceased vaccination clinics, halted wastewater surveillance programs and even terminated a contract with the courier service that transports specimens to state labs to test for infectious diseases. One Minnesota public health agency, which had provided 1,400 shots for children at clinics last year, immediately stopped those clinics when the directive arrived, court records show.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;A federal judge temporarily barred HHS from enacting the cuts, but the ruling, which came more than a week after the grants were terminated, was too late for programs that had already been canceled and employees who had already been laid off. Lawyers for HHS have asked the judge to reconsider her decision in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Department of Education to terminate grants for teacher training while that case is being argued in lower courts. The judge in the HHS case has not yet ruled on the motion.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;But in tiny storefronts and cozy homes, at school fairs and gas stations, many residents in West Texas, near where the measles outbreak has taken hold, appear unfazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1"&gt;“I don’t need a vaccine,” one man sitting on his porch said recently. “I don’t get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.2"&gt;“It’s measles. It’s been around forever,” said a woman making her way to her car. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.3"&gt;When asked why they weren’t planning on vaccinating their baby, a husband walking alongside his wife who was 27 weeks pregnant simply said, “It’s God’s will.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class="attribution__caption"&gt;Seminole last month. Many residents in West Texas appear unfazed by the measles outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0"&gt;In word and deed, Kennedy has sown doubt about immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;In response to the measles outbreak, Kennedy initially said in a column he wrote for Fox News that the decision to vaccinate is a “personal one.” HHS sent doses of vitamin A alongside vaccines to Texas, and Kennedy praised the use of cod liver oil. Only the vaccine prevents measles.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;About a week later, in an interview on Fox News, while Kennedy encouraged vaccines, he said he was a “freedom of choice person.” At the same time, he emphasized the risks of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0"&gt;Only after the second measles death in Texas did &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;Kennedy post&lt;/a&gt; on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0"&gt;But even that is not the unequivocal message that the head of HHS should be sending, said Ratner, the infectious diseases doctor in New York. It is, he said, a tepid recommendation at best.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;“It gives the impression that these things are equivalent, that you can choose one or the other, and that is disingenuous,” he said. “We don’t have a treatment for measles. We have vitamin A, which we can give to kids with measles, that decreases but doesn’t eliminate the risk of severe outcomes. It doesn’t do anything for prevention of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;In the past, Kennedy has been a fierce critic of the vaccine. In a foreword to a 2021 book on measles released by the nonprofit that he founded, Kennedy wrote, “Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to ‘do something.’ They then inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children for the sole purpose of fattening industry profits.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0"&gt;A spokesperson for HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Kennedy, the spokesperson said, responded to the measles outbreak with “clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles” and under his leadership, the CDC updated its pediatric patient management protocol for measles to include physician-administered vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;Kennedy, the spokesperson added, “is uniquely qualified to lead HHS at this pivotal moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0"&gt;Late last month, leaders at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report"&gt;ordered staff to bury a risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; that emphasized the need for vaccines in response to the measles outbreak — in spite of the fact the CDC has long &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;promoted vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of public health. While a CDC spokesperson acknowledged that vaccines offer the best protection from measles, she also repeated a line Kennedy had used: “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;Among the approximately 2,400 jobs eliminated at the CDC was a team in the Immunization Services Division that partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-equity/php/about/partnering-for-vaccine-equity-partners.html"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; to promote access to and confidence in vaccines in communities where coverage lagged.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;The National Institutes of Health, which is also under HHS, recently ended funding for studies that examine vaccine hesitancy. In early April, researchers, the American Public Health Association and one of the largest unions in the country sued the NIH and its director, Jay Bhattacharya, along with HHS and Kennedy, alleging they terminated grants “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.” The government hasn’t filed a response in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0"&gt;The NIH cancellation notices stated that the agency’s policy was not to prioritize research that focuses on “gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0"&gt;“These grants are being canceled in the midst of an outbreak, a vaccine-preventable outbreak,” said Rupali Limaye, an associate professor at George Mason University who has spent the past decade studying vaccine hesitancy. “We need to better understand why people are not accepting vaccines now more than ever. This outbreak is still spreading.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0"&gt;That vaccines prevent diseases is settled science. For decades, there was a societal understanding that getting vaccinated benefited not only the person who got the shot, but also the broader community, especially babies or people with weakened immune systems, like those in chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0"&gt;An investment in public health and a sustained, large-scale approach to vaccines is what helped the country declare the elimination of the measles in 2000, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0"&gt;But she has watched both deteriorate over the last few months. Nearly every morning since notices of the federal funding cuts began going out to local public health agencies, she has woken up to texts from panicked public health workers. She has led daily calls with local health departments and sat in on multiple emergency board meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0"&gt;Freeman has compiled a list of more than 100 direct consequences of the cuts, including one rural health department in the Midwest that can no longer carry out immunization services. That’s vital because there are no hospitals in the county and all public health duties fall to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0"&gt;“It’s relentless,” she said. “It feels like a barrage and assault on public health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0"&gt;More than 1,600 miles away from Washington, D.C., in Lubbock, Texas, the director of the city’s health department, Katherine Wells, sighed last week when she saw the most recent measles numbers. She would have to alert her staff to work late again.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0"&gt;“There’s a lot of cases,” she said, “and we continue to see more and more cases.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0"&gt;She didn’t know it at the time, but that night would mark the state’s second measles death this year. An earlier death in February was the country’s first in a decade. Both children were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0"&gt;Kennedy said he traveled to Gaines County to comfort the family who lost their 8-year-old daughter and while there met with the family of the 6-year-old girl who died in February.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0"&gt;He also visited with two local doctors he described as “extraordinary healers,” he said in his post on X. The men, he claimed, have “treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” using aerosolized budesonide — typically used to prevent symptoms of asthma — and clarithromycin — an antibiotic. Medical experts said neither is an effective measles treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0"&gt;State health officials have traced about two-thirds of the measles cases in Texas to Gaines County, which sits on the western edge of the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.1"&gt;Seminole, one of the county’s only two incorporated towns, has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak, with Tina Siemens acting as a community ambassador of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0"&gt;On a recent Tuesday, atop the museum’s dark coffee table, notes scrawled onto white paper listed the latest shipments of vitamin C and Alaskan cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0"&gt;Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, is working to keep the measles outbreak from reaching his community, just five hours east of Seminole. He wrote letters to the public school superintendents and leaders of private schools that had large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated students offering to set up mobile vaccine clinics for them.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0"&gt;“Overall, the rates can look OK,” he said, “but when you’ve got these pockets of unvaccinated, that’s where the vulnerability lies.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0"&gt;Huang has had to lay off 11 full-time employees, 10 temporary workers and cancel more than 50 vaccine clinics following the HHS cuts. The systemic dismantling of the CDC and other federal health agencies, he said, will have a grave and lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0"&gt;“This is setting us back decades,” Huang said. “Everyone should be extremely concerned about what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0"&gt;Across the country, pediatricians are petrified, said Dr. Susan Kressly, who serves as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the largest professional organization of pediatricians in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0"&gt;“Many of us are losing sleep,” Kressly said. “If we lose that progress, children will pay the price.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0"&gt;She’s carefully watching the spread of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including an increase in whooping cases that far outpace the typical peaks seen every few years. Although the whooping cough vaccine isn’t as effective as the ones for measles and protection wanes over time, the CDC says it remains the best way to prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0"&gt;Babies under the age of 1 are among the most at risk of severe complications from whooping cough, including slowed or stopped breathing and pneumonia, according to the CDC. About one-third of infants who get whooping cough end up in the hospital. Newborns are especially vulnerable because the CDC doesn’t recommend the first shot until two months. That’s why experts recommend pregnant mothers and anyone who will be around the baby to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0"&gt;The number of whooping cough cases dropped significantly during the pandemic, but it exploded in recent years. In 2021, the CDC reported 2,116 cases; last year, there were 35,435.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0"&gt;The numbers this year appear set to eclipse 2024. So far in 2025, 7,111 cases have been reported, which is more than double this time last year. Cases tend to spike in the summer and fall, which adds to experts’ concern about high numbers so early in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0"&gt;States on the Pacific Coast and in the Midwest have reported the most cases this year, with Washington leading the country with 742 cases so far, more than five times as many as at this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0"&gt;The Washington child who died of whooping cough had no underlying medical conditions, according to a spokesperson for the Spokane Regional Health District. The death was announced in February but occurred in November.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0"&gt;While Washington’s overall vaccination rate for whooping cough has remained relatively steady over the last decade at around 90%, pockets of low vaccination rates have allowed the disease to take root and put the wider community at risk, said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, a pediatrician and chief health officer of the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0"&gt;This is the time to strengthen the public health system, he said, to build trust in those areas and make it easier for children to get their routine vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.1"&gt;“But instead, we’re seeing the exact opposite happen,” he said. “We’re weakening our public health system, and that will put us on a path towards more illness and shorter lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0"&gt;Washington was one of 23 states and the District of Columbia that sued HHS and Kennedy following the $11 billion cuts, which rescinded approximately $118 million from the state. Doing so, the state said in court records, would impact 150 full-time employees and cause an immediate reduction in the agency’s ability to respond to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0"&gt;Washington’s Care-A-Van, a mobile health clinic that travels across the state to provide vaccinations, conduct blood pressure screenings and distribute opioid overdose kits, was a key element in the department’s vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0"&gt;But that, too, has been diminished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.1"&gt;An alert on the department’s website cataloged the impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.2"&gt;“Attention,” it began.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0"&gt;As a result of the unexpected decision to terminate grant funding, “all Care-A-Van operations have been paused indefinitely, including the cancellation of more than 104 upcoming clinics across the state.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0"&gt;The department had anticipated providing approximately 2,000 childhood vaccines as part of that effort.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0"&gt;The frustration came through in Kwan-Gett’s voice. Many people think that federal cuts to public health mean shrinking the federal workforce, he said, but those clawbacks also get passed down to states and cities and counties. The less federal support that trickles down to the local level, the less protected communities will be.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0"&gt;“It really breaks my heart,” he said, “when I see children suffering from preventable diseases like whooping cough and measles when we have the tools to prevent them.”&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. called for people to get the measles vaccine while in the same breath falsely claiming it hasn’t been “safety tested” and its protection is short-lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist now overseeing federal health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had shied away from a full-throated endorsement of measles vaccinations, instead claiming the vaccine is the “most effective way” to prevent the virus’ spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2U0csKvqMY" target="_blank"&gt;In an interview&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday with CBS News, Kennedy said the Trump administration was focused on finding ways to treat people who choose not to get vaccinated. However, there &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374862" target="_blank"&gt;are no approved treatments&lt;/a&gt; for measles, which &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many medical experts have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;taken issue with his approach&lt;/a&gt; to the current measles outbreak, which has included &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasizing unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; and framing vaccination as a personal choice (which some doctors view as a nod to his anti-vaccine supporters). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy also suggested that measles cases are inevitable in the United States because of ebbing immunity from vaccines — a notion doctors say is false. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,” Kennedy said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine offer lifelong protection. That’s because the vaccine stimulates the production of memory cells, he said, which can recognize the virus over a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned,” said Offit, who serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Aside from occasional outbreaks, measles hasn’t been constantly present in the United States since before 2000. It is introduced locally by international travelers, and from there it can spread among undervaccinated communities.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The federal government’s position is, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But the government should not be mandating those,” Kennedy told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The federal government doesn’t mandate childhood vaccines; rather, all 50 states require them for children attending public school. The FDA approves vaccines based on safety and efficacy, and the CDC makes recommendations about who should get them, which states often choose to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-non-medical-exemptions-from-school-immunization-requirements" target="_blank"&gt;all 50 states have exemptions to vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt; for medical reasons, and all but five have additional exemptions for other reasons, such as religious or personal objections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The current outbreak was fueled by transmission in a primarily Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent. There have been 668 total cases since January, according to NBC News’ tally, including two pediatric deaths and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;one suspected death in an unvaccinated adult&lt;/a&gt;. Before those deaths, the United States hadn’t had a measles death in a decade, and a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm#" target="_blank"&gt;child hadn’t died of measles&lt;/a&gt; since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/rfk-jr-pushes-fluoride-policy-review-cites-autism-concerns-237047877801" target="_blank"&gt;pointed to higher case numbers in Europe&lt;/a&gt; as evidence that the United States is responding appropriately to the outbreak. But the figure he has cited recently — roughly 127,000 measles cases in Europe — is &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/13-03-2025-european-region-reports-highest-number-of-measles-cases-in-more-than-25-years---unicef--who-europe" target="_blank"&gt;the total for last year across 53 countries&lt;/a&gt;. Low vaccination rates in southeastern Europe were a major contributor, according to the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He has this way of kind of twisting things,” said Dr. William Moss, director of the Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center. “We should be comparing measles in the United States this year to measles in the United States and prior years. To say Europe has more cases over one year than we’ve had in three months this year, it’s just a false comparison.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This year’s count in the United States is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-measles-cases-2024-so-far-rcna145013" target="_blank"&gt;highest since 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when there was a major outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. Doctors fear the United States could be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966" target="_blank"&gt;on the verge of losing its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; as Kennedy continues to sow doubt about vaccine safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Right now we don’t know the risks of many of these products because they’re not safety tested,” Kennedy told CBS News. “Many of the vaccines are only tested for three or four days with no placebo group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children’s Hospital, said vaccine development usually takes 10 to 20 years, with the notable exception of Covid shots, which were brought to market in less than a year thanks to mRNA technology and a coordinated, worldwide effort. (Even then, the &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/publications-and-special-projects/penn-medicine-magazine/winter-2022/from-foundational-discoveries-to-pandemic-proliferation-of-impact" target="_blank"&gt;foundational research behind mRNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; dates to 1997.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When it comes to childhood immunizations, many of which were approved decades ago, there may not have been placebo controls or long-term safety follow-ups for each one, Levy said. However, he noted that even after vaccines are approved, various government-led surveillance systems monitor for adverse reactions. And in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2726" target="_blank"&gt;rare case they find anything&lt;/a&gt;, that vaccine is pulled from the market, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Moss agreed that the types of clinical trials for vaccines have changed over time. However, “I don’t think there’s any other product we use that’s more rigorously evaluated for both safety and efficacy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Offit said Kennedy “just keeps picking and picking” at vaccine safety with statements that aren’t scientifically valid — for instance, by suggesting that &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1819855873801392393" target="_blank"&gt;all childhood vaccines weren’t tested against placebos&lt;/a&gt;, when, in fact, many were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The problem with RFK Jr. is his definition of ‘placebo,’” Offit said. “His definition of placebo is either water or saline, meaning just normal sodium chloride, but that’s not the FDA’s definition. The FDA’s definition is something that’s inert.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said Kennedy “raised valid concerns about vaccine trial practices, including the use of active comparators instead of inert placebos and short observation windows — issues backed by public data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But doctors said there’s a legitimate reason to use active comparators — vaccines that have already been approved for given infections — instead of placebos: It would be unethical to withhold the benefit of a vaccine from study participants, so trials often test new vaccines against older versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Levy said there’s always room for more safety studies or longer-term follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I think the secretary is right that we could do more to study vaccine safety,” he said. “By all means, let’s dig in. Let’s see, did we miss anything? Should we learn more? But let’s not forget that these vaccines in childhood have averted severe disease in children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNQThWSTlaNDlHMUJrU0pVR0FaaDU4RndEVnBzWkFvbEluQm1DbUFlWWw0NzlheU13ZlJRQzFfMUZvdmpMd29KMlVKNGsxdjZJb1lPV3dpX1gtc09Zd2ZISV95allnT29RUk4tTzJGQ2ZUU2Z1UEo2Y08wcjVLYmxieDVqV1pHNld5MVlTaWpVQVUwd3c2NnhxZWY4OWRuSE9hWF8tMDZrRXVmalBjUXcxUjRwVETSAVZBVV95cUxOSVlFRTdRWE1TYXRsMndFV3F2S2hLSXRqVldTOFNZZXFXM1h0dHBJMlhzNlY0bl9NamJ1UmdzZXZKRkl6YWZ1SFZCaGJfaEx6bGVJQ0V1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Charleston comedian gained 30 pounds of water weight in 1 weekend.

The 42-year-old thought she was having escalating panic attacks. She felt out of breath and anxious walking in a large group at a theme park. Her ankles were swelling, but she chalked it up to standing for most of the day while painting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not in amazing shape, but I'm not old either," she told The Post and Courier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-vertical  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-left tnt-inline-width-one-third"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-vertical hover-expand letterbox-style-default"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-133d04c0-7667-43bf-be4e-91884b345da1" data-instance="#gallery-items-f91e3846-0e49-49df-9e3e-6098a67b5fd5-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-f91e3846-0e49-49df-9e3e-6098a67b5fd5"&gt;

                                    &lt;p&gt;Shawna Jarrett now has more than $30,000 in medical bills after tests to find out why she gained 30 pounds of water weight in one weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when she put on 30 pounds of fluid from the waist down in one weekend, she knew something was wrong. She started with a trip to her primary care physician. That's where the tests began. Her kidneys were fine. Her heart was not. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Her resting heart rate was in the 120s, and an echocardiogram revealed her heart was functioning at just 22 percent, "which is not a number you want to hear," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was sent to the hospital for structural testing to make sure her arteries were not blocked or damaged. She had a heart catheter procedure, a cardiac MRI and "every ultrasound under the sun." &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis was heart failure and cardiomyopathy. In Jarrett's case, this is manageable with medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was great news," Jarrett said. "It went from 'OMG, I'm gonna die' to relief." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then came the medical bills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s a matter of, 'Oh, I can’t actually afford to figure this out,'" said Jarrett. "I'm a visual artist and a comic, and I don’t know if you know this, but the benefits are not good."&lt;/p&gt;

Up to half of patients stop taking them or reduce the dose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It increases the risk of heart and circulation problems caused by harmful fats, or lipids. They can lead to potentially fatal blood clots. &lt;span&gt;The pills have been linked to muscle pain, headaches, dizziness, nausea, tiredness and digestive problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lead author Professor Maciej Banach, of the Medical University of Lodz in Poland, said: "These results were not a surprise to me but they were for many other experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "They show in most cases statin intolerance is over-estimated and over-diagnosed. &lt;span&gt;They mean around 93% of patients on statin therapy can be treated effectively - with very good tolerability and without any safety issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The largest study of its kind to date was based on more than 4 million individuals across the world. &lt;span&gt;Statins are prescribed to up to 8 million Britons - protecting against heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prof Banach said: "Our findings mean we should evaluate patients' symptoms very carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Firstly to see whether symptoms are indeed caused by statins, and secondly, to evaluate whether it might be patients' perceptions that statins are harmful. &lt;span&gt;The so called 'nocebo' or 'drucebo' effect could be responsible for more than 50% of all symptoms - rather than the drug itself."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Statins are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. There is "strong and unambiguous" evidence that they combat cardiovascular disease. &lt;span&gt;It was not been clear what proportion of the population are actually allergic to them - until now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Inconsistent reports from studies, randomised controlled trials and databases suggested numbers ranging from five to 50 per cent. &lt;span&gt;The study, published in the European Heart Journal, found the real figure is at the lower end of the scale. It pooled data from 176 studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Overall prevalence was nine per cent - falling to seven, 6.7 and six per cent when using diagnostic criteria from the National Lipid Association, the International Lipid Expert Panel and the European Atherosclerosis Society, respectively. &lt;span&gt;Those who were older, female, of Black or Asian race, obese, or suffering from diabetes, under-active thyroid glands, or chronic liver or kidney failure were more likely to be statin intolerant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In addition, drugs to control irregular heartbeat, calcium channel blockers for chest pain and high blood pressure, heavy drinking and higher statin doses were other aggravating factors. &lt;span&gt;Prof Banach said: "It's critically important to know about these risk factors so we can predict effectively that a particular patient is at higher risk of statin intolerance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Then we can consider upfront other ways to treat them in order to reduce the risk and improve adherence to treatment. &lt;span&gt;This could include lower statin doses, combination therapy and use of innovative new drugs."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Prevalence in these groups ranged from 22 percent for high alcohol consumption to 48 per cent for women. &lt;span&gt;Prof Banach said: "I believe the size of our study, which is the largest in the world to investigate this question, means we are able to finally and effectively answer the question about the true prevalence of statin intolerance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These results clearly show patients needn’t be afraid of statin therapy as it is very well tolerated in as much as 93 per cent, which is similar or even better than other cardiology drugs, including ones for reducing blood pressure and clotting or blocking of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "What is more, patients need to know that statins may prolong their life, and in cases where side effects appear, we have enough knowledge to manage these effectively. &lt;span&gt;The most important message to patients as a result of this study is that they should keep on taking statins according to the prescribed dose, and discuss any side effects with their doctor, rather than discontinuing the medication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "The same clear message can be addressed to physicians treating patients with high cholesterol levels. &lt;span&gt;Most cases of statin intolerance observed in clinical practice are associated with effects caused by patients' misconceptions about the side effects of statins or may be due to other reasons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Therefore, we should carefully evaluate symptoms, assessing in detail patients' medical histories, when the symptoms appeared, specific details of pain, other medications the patients are taking, and other conditions and risk factors. &lt;span&gt;Then we will see that statins can be used safely in most patients, which is critically important for reducing their cholesterol levels and preventing heart and blood vessel diseases and death."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 07:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQcTBMZzVmeWVuM09zRUZGOTEyeEVXbWw1RHBwV1dGTGxNWVNKejVOZ2ZxR0RLaTg4aUxTVXI2cDRvdnlHYV9QZXpQLUpKTDh5ZUl3dTVLUzF6ZW8zUnhNTEZ1ME9sbHh0Y3dFMTRlSHMxeTBVUFR5bXJxMldfdEphZENGQWZ4VnNwQ18tWg</guid></item><item><title>New study shows 'surprisingly common' symptom can lead to heart failure - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxObDhFSFdzSUkzSVlXRnVlcnAySmRRcjJpRTBXek1oOEZHNXEtM24td0YwTE1tQ0NyNkx4X2g4b3dDQVlHNXpubjVhbmxQblI3MDNaNFFNbDdKelVQVHVlT2NzVThFSGRoMHdtLUx0SjZjTW1RTHJUR1ZXbEhmcjFkb2YtclF0QkhFTWktaNIBkgFBVV95cUxPd05pOXdDLXJIaTYzcGtnaHQ2VEdBcWltM0h5RWhBR2h0R2ZEQVktRHdtR09TVnRPQWFrbFVGS1dMbEhIR1NFeDMyYVRWQjhzLVc0TkVFX3BrTjU5UTdaTXBaQzlSQTJzNjg3MmFVd3B1TmRKeDIyZEFUb0VaY3pfUGtrck1UM2xMSUNzZUpjNEVlUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has revealed that hearing impairment can increase an individual's risk of heart failure. The research highlighted the significant role psychological distress, caused by hearing loss, plays in developing heart-related issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chinese experts analysed UK Biobank data from 164,431 individuals who had undergone tests to determine their hearing ability. Out of these, approximately 160,062 did not use hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants were divided into three groups based on their performance in a digit triplet test (DTT), a screening tool for hearing problems that uses random combinations of digits against background noise. None of the participants initially included in the analysis had heart failure. However, over a follow-up period exceeding 11 years, around 4,449 developed the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in the legs and ankles. It is estimated that over one million people in the UK live with this long-term condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that those with a higher speech reception threshold (SRT) – meaning they required louder speech to comprehend words – had an increased risk of heart failure. They stated: "Compared with those with normal hearing, participants with insufficient hearing, poor hearing, or hearing aid use had higher heart failure risks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Main symptoms heart failure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms of heart failure are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/shortness-of-breath/" rel="nofollow"&gt;breathlessness&lt;/a&gt; – this may occur after activity or at rest; it may be worse when you're lying down, and you may wake up at night needing to catch your breath&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fatigue – you may feel tired most of the time and find exercise exhausting&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;swollen ankles and legs – this is caused by a build-up of fluid (&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/oedema/" rel="nofollow"&gt;oedema&lt;/a&gt;); it may be better in the morning and get worse later in the day&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;feeling lightheaded and fainting&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;High SRT levels were also linked with psychological distress, social isolation, and neuroticism among those who did not use hearing aids. Researchers stated: "We have been the first to demonstrate that poor hearing ability is significantly associated with a higher risk of incident heart failure in the general population."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Psychological factors, especially psychological distress, play a significant mediating role in this association. "If further confirmed, hearing impairment may be a potential risk factor or marker for incident heart failure in the general population, highlighting the importance of integrating hearing health assessments into broader cardiovascular risk evaluation frameworks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strengthening psychological intervention in people with hearing impairment may be an important path and strategy to reduce the risk of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 07:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxObDhFSFdzSUkzSVlXRnVlcnAySmRRcjJpRTBXek1oOEZHNXEtM24td0YwTE1tQ0NyNkx4X2g4b3dDQVlHNXpubjVhbmxQblI3MDNaNFFNbDdKelVQVHVlT2NzVThFSGRoMHdtLUx0SjZjTW1RTHJUR1ZXbEhmcjFkb2YtclF0QkhFTWktaNIBkgFBVV95cUxPd05pOXdDLXJIaTYzcGtnaHQ2VEdBcWltM0h5RWhBR2h0R2ZEQVktRHdtR09TVnRPQWFrbFVGS1dMbEhIR1NFeDMyYVRWQjhzLVc0TkVFX3BrTjU5UTdaTXBaQzlSQTJzNjg3MmFVd3B1TmRKeDIyZEFUb0VaY3pfUGtrck1UM2xMSUNzZUpjNEVlUQ</guid></item><item><title>How US funding cuts are threatening South African families living with HIV - Al Jazeera</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg wysiwyg--all-content" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Johannesburg, South Africa –&lt;/strong&gt; Last year, Mary* finally had the conversation she had been dreading for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary has lived with HIV since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the 36-year-old has also carried the burden of another secret: Lita*, her daughter, was born with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking from her four-room home in the bustling township of Soweto, just south of Johannesburg, where she lives with Lita and her parents, Mary recalls the fear she felt as she prepared to tell her child about her condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had to tell her last year that she has HIV eventually, and I was very worried,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lita has been receiving treatment since birth – a daily antiretroviral (ARV) tablet that is a combination of different drugs. The pill stops the HIV virus from reproducing in her body and keeps her immune system healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My child is very healthy and happy,” Mary beams, her eyes lighting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But until recently, Lita, who is thriving at 12 years old, didn’t understand what the medication was for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lita now participates in a local after-school programme that not only provides assistance with homework but also incorporates sports and psychosocial support for children living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary, who is currently unemployed and a single mother, relies on a government grant as well as support from her family to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The struggle for mother and daughter begins with the challenge of securing medication to treat HIV, but it also extends to managing the daily reality of living with the virus, which includes social stigma, and accessing healthy food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the months when she can’t go to the local government clinic to collect her and her daughter’s ARV treatment because of persisting health issues partly related to her HIV status, Mary finds solace in the support of the community organisation Crystal Fountain, which delivers medication to her doorstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organisation also has a disclosure programme through which social workers helped Mary speak to Lita about her condition and how, although she will have to be on treatment for the rest of her life, she could still be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They helped me in telling my child that she has HIV and made us feel very supported,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary and Lita also benefit from the organisation’s food vouchers, allowing them to obtain groceries like maize meal and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But critical support provided by Crystal Fountain and other community initiatives addressing HIV/AIDS now hangs in the balance. The administration of United States President Donald Trump, which was responsible for funding nearly a fourth of what South Africa spends to combat HIV, has threatened these programmes with sweeping cuts to US foreign aid budgets. Some organisations have been forced to shut down certain programmes while others have stopped operating entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3628132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3628132" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3628132" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25047660562477-1744028712.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513" alt="South Africa HIV Aid Freeze"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3628132" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In the town of Umzimkhulu in eastern South Africa, Nozuko Majola, 19, pictured with her children, is one of the millions of patients in South Africa affected by Trump’s global foreign aid freeze, raising concerns about HIV patients not receiving treatment [Jerome Delay/AP Photo]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="we-have-to-help-these-parents"&gt;‘We have to help these parents’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of the HIV epidemic in South Africa, a country of 63 million people, is staggering. About 7.8 million currently live with HIV, including an estimated 270,000 children under 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, 10,000 children are estimated to be infected with HIV while 2,100 die from HIV-related causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="/news/2025/3/24/hiv-and-aids-deaths-could-increase-globally-amid-us-aid-freeze-un-says"&gt;UNAIDS&lt;/a&gt;, the United Nations agency that coordinates global action for preventing and treating HIV/AIDS, the majority of these cases stem from transmission occurring before or during birth with a smaller number contracting the virus later through breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Trump, the US government halted funding for the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a global health investment introduced in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, South Africa received about $440m in PEPFAR funding, accounting for 22 percent of the country’s $2.56bn HIV budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This budget goes towards treatment for millions of people, testing programmes, HIV research, education drives and other community support initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEPFAR is the source of most of the funding for South Africa’s HIV programmes supported by USAID, the US Agency for International Development. Under Trump, the agency has in effect been dismantled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the halt in funding, counselling initiatives and programmes including testing, education and community support have shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is at risk is the support we were giving to the households of kids infected with HIV,” Rebecca Chakane, a social worker with Crystal Fountain in Soweto, explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The [food] vouchers and the support groups – those are very important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the sprawling township of Soweto, countless families among the 1.8 million people who live there struggle with HIV. The hardship faced by mothers of HIV-positive children echoes in the words of Soweto resident Tshepiso*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She describes her emotional turmoil following the diagnosis at birth of her nine-month-old son, Thulani*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been very, very hard,” she confides, adding that she blamed herself for her son’s condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tshepiso, like Mary, relies on free medication from state-run clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s health minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, says the funding cuts for HIV programmes will not affect access to free ARV treatment that millions of people receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no chance of medication being interrupted. [The] government buys 90 percent of medication and the other 10 percent comes from the Global Fund [NGO],” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, beyond medication, Tshepiso has needed emotional support, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her search for solidarity, Tshepiso discovered a monthly support group run by Crystal Fountain for parents raising HIV-positive children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the shared stories and collective struggles, she found a community. The organisation also provided monthly food packages, a source of immense help and relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Crystal Fountain has now ended some programmes, including its food aid, and Tshepiso worries about how she will feed herself and her baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what we are going to do,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access to nutritious food, especially in impoverished areas like Soweto, is a vital component of children’s overall treatment, according to Chakane, who says research over the years has illuminated how HIV management must go beyond just the provision of ARV drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support programmes are also crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some children become resentful of their parents upon learning they have HIV, which may lead them to abandon their medication. Community workers help families navigate this scenario – and it is one they often encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most kids blame their parents for the infection, creating a complicated situation that sometimes leads them to stop taking treatment. Therefore, we have to help these parents,” Chakane says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the USAID cuts, we can’t do these [support] programmes any more,” she laments, pointing to the ripple effect of funding losses on essential services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nowhere-to-turn"&gt;‘Nowhere to turn’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mpumalanga province, about 300km east of Soweto, 31-year-old community worker Thulisile Mahole voices her anguish over the abrupt closure of the Greater Rape Intervention Programme (GRIP), a USAID-supported nonprofit where she worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/economy/2025/2/27/us-cutting-foreign-aid-budgets-by-more-than-90-trump-administration-says"&gt;US government&lt;/a&gt; dramatically slashed its foreign aid budgets soon after Trump took office on January 20. On the morning of January 28, Mahole, who captures data for community programmes aimed at addressing HIV/AIDS and combating gender-based violence, left home for her office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I went to work expecting just another regular day, but then they called a staff meeting and told us that the USAID cut had happened and we had to stop everything right away. It was so chaotic,” she recalls. “I was devastated. I was in complete shock. As a parent with bills to pay, you are never prepared for a situation like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahole’s journey at GRIP began as a first responder in a care room – private rooms in police stations run by NGOs aimed at assisting and protecting victims of sexual violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We provided a safe space for women. When someone reports a rape case, they often have to return to the home of the person who harmed them,” Mahole explains, referring to how family members or intimate partners are often perpetrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our role was to make survivors feel seen and supported, to show them there was a place for them to go if they felt unsafe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survivors would go to them before they had even spoken to police officers, she says. “I would provide them with basic counselling. … We assisted them in opening police cases and obtaining medical help,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a country with high rates of rape with more than 40,000 rapes recorded annually, according to police statistics, and the&lt;a href="/news/2025/2/28/africa-hiv-deaths-to-mount-as-trump-stops-funding-heres-why"&gt; highest number of people living with HIV in the world&lt;/a&gt;, programmes like GRIP were essential in providing support to survivors and helping curb the spread of HIV. It provided rape victims, who are at risk of contracting the virus, with preventive medication and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRIP’s care rooms now stand empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it closed, rape survivors have approached Mahole on the street in her township of Dantjie on the outskirts of the eastern city of Mbombela, seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are people who are being raped or harassed, and they want help. They know I worked in a care room that used to aid survivors, and I have to tell them there’s no care rooms any more,” Mahole says, her voice heavy. “It is heartbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Mahole, the thought of these services being discontinued has been nearly impossible to accept. “I couldn’t believe that women who are already so vulnerable would have nowhere to turn,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After losing her job, Mahole hoped that what she calls a “dangerous decision” would be reversed. However, as funding cuts became widespread, her hopes began to fade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sole-breadwinners-affected"&gt;Sole breadwinners affected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA), which commissioned GRIP to deliver its support programmes, says the consequences of terminating these programmes are too enormous to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesperson Sophie Knobbs notes that GRIP had been active since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Before the cuts, we were reaching 32,000 survivors a year. Now, those survivors could be left without any support,” Knobbs says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NACOSA has been forced to shut down all its USAID-supported programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“More than 160 of our 470 staff members were immediately let go of, and a radical restructure is under way,” Knobbs adds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She emphasises that community workers – many of whom were survivors of gender-based violence themselves – were among the hardest hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many of them are the sole breadwinners for their families,” she says. “It has been devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_3628106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3628106" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3628106" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-03-13T174917Z_995199452_RC2HCDAUCIJ6_RTRMADP_3_SAFRICA-TRANSPORT-1744028365.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C515" alt="South Africa HIV Aid Freeze"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3628106" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Minibus taxis are seen at Bara Taxi Rank, one of the busiest transport hubs in Soweto.

&lt;h2 id="risk-a-rebound"&gt;‘Risk a rebound’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s cuts to USAID which distributes PEPFAR funding, not only halted HIV support programmes but also stalled HIV research and clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a crisis,” says Glenda Gray, a leading HIV researcher in South Africa at the University of the Witwatersrand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you take your foot off the accelerator, you risk a rebound in HIV transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, about 50,000 people died of HIV-related causes, according to the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, a research facility at the University of Cape Town, says the suspension of US funding could lead to an additional 500,000 HIV-linked deaths in South Africa over the next decade. This is due to a halt in testing, awareness and support programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gray says the medical community, NGOs and the government are scrambling to find interim solutions for funding critical HIV research programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, she is sceptical that these efforts could salvage essential research programmes that had relied on US National Institutes of Health grants, now halted by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The situation has threatened basic science,” Gray tells Al Jazeera. “Many researchers working on critical HIV projects have had to be laid off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the projects that has come to a halt was work on a promising vaccine to prevent HIV. The BRILLIANT Consortium, led by three scientists in South Africa, relied completely on a $45m USAID grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the grant stopping, our progress has been delayed, and it’s a huge challenge,” explains Neetha Shagan Morar, a research manager with the project. “We can’t treat our way out of the HIV epidemic. We need a preventative vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, researchers, NGO staff and parents are concerned about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite government assurances that AVR medication will remain accessible, Mary and others worry about whether the loss of HIV programmes could ultimately cost children like Lita the medication they need to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For now, we don’t know if we will be affected,” Mary says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Names have been changed to protect identities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Similarly, encouraging someone to see a GP if symptoms are suspected, and possibly accompanying them, can be supportive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early diagnosis of dementia can facilitate access to future care and treatment.

Regular screening saves lives:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer tends to develop silently, without any prominent symptoms in its early stages. Hence, regular screening is important for everyone. Everyone should start screening at the age of 45 or even earlier if there is a family history of the disease. Go for tests such as colonoscopy, stool-based tests and CT colonography to help detect polyps or cancer at an early stage and improve one’s quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2023/12/02/550x309/According-to-WHO--colon-cancer-is-the-third-most-c_1701539729258.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="According to WHO, colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 10% of all cases and is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.

(REPRESENTATIVE PIC)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Adhere to a healthy diet:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fibre-rich diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes helps to cut down the risk of cancer. Reducing processed foods and high-fat foods can also help. Even drinking plenty of water and limiting alcohol intake contribute to better colon health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Exercise every day:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a known fact that a sedentary lifestyle can expose you to the risk of a plethora of diseases and conditions. Regular exercise, such as walking, jogging, yoga, or strength training, helps improve digestion and lower inflammation in the body. One must get at least 30 minutes of exercise for 5 days a week to maintain a healthy colon.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2019/10/17/Pictures/_d6bee990-f0d2-11e9-8e48-0fd2949bd28d.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="According to the researchers, exercise is important for cancer prevention and can lower the risk of developing colon, breast, endometrial, kidney, bladder, esophagus and stomach cancers.(Unsplash)" title="According to the researchers, exercise is important for cancer prevention and can lower the risk of developing colon, breast, endometrial, kidney, bladder, esophagus and stomach cancers.(Unsplash)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;According to the researchers, exercise is important for cancer prevention and can lower the risk of developing colon, breast, endometrial, kidney, bladder, esophagus and stomach cancers.(Unsplash)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Family history and genetics:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with a family history of colon cancer are at a higher risk. So, screening should begin earlier, right from the age of 25. Genetic counselling may also help assess personal risk. Do it as suggested by the doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Early symptoms should not be ignored:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you aware? Colon cancer may not show symptoms early on. Constant changes in bowel habits, blood in the stool, sudden weight loss, abdominal pain, or fatigue should be reported to the doctor for further evaluation. The doctor will initiate treatment after the diagnosis of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colon cancer prevention begins with early detection, healthy habits and awareness. By following a balanced diet, staying active, undergoing regular screenings and paying attention to symptoms. Taking important steps today can make a life-saving difference in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Protein is the cornerstone macronutrient for muscle development due to its role in muscle protein synthesis (MPS), the process of repairing and growing muscle fibers after resistance training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article details the top 10 high-protein foods that support lean muscle growth, with each selection grounded in scientific evidence. These foods deliver quality amino acids, optimal bioavailability, and additional nutrients critical for hypertrophy and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Chicken Breast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Chicken-and-broccoli-1024x580.jpg" alt="Nutrition Hacks Post Workout" class="wp-image-182403" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Chicken-and-broccoli-600x340.jpg 600w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Chicken-and-broccoli-300x170.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Chicken-and-broccoli-768x435.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Chicken-and-broccoli-741x420.jpg 741w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Chicken-and-broccoli-150x85.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Chicken-and-broccoli-696x394.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2023/04/Chicken-and-broccoli-822x466.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken breast is a staple in bodybuilding and fitness nutrition due to its exceptionally high protein-to-fat ratio. A 100-gram serving provides approximately 31 grams of protein with only 3.6 grams of fat, making it ideal for those aiming to gain muscle without excess body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein in chicken breast is classified as a complete protein, containing all nine essential amino acids necessary for muscle repair and growth. According to a study published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, consuming lean animal protein like chicken post-exercise increases rates of MPS significantly (Tipton et al., 2004).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-372dccc50506fc5a37bb00f14fbc14a6 brx-content" id="brx-372dccc50506fc5a37bb00f14fbc14a6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Eggs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs are one of the most bioavailable sources of protein, containing about 6 grams per egg. They’re also rich in leucine, the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) most directly involved in stimulating MPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; found that whole eggs stimulate muscle protein synthesis more effectively than egg whites alone, likely due to the synergistic effects of fat and micronutrients in the yolk (van Vliet et al., 2017). The study highlighted the importance of consuming whole eggs to maximize hypertrophic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Greek Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greek yogurt is packed with slow-digesting casein and fast-digesting whey, making it ideal for sustained amino acid delivery. A 200-gram serving typically offers 20 grams of high-quality protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that a blend of whey and casein from dairy improves MPS rates and muscle recovery when consumed post-exercise (Churchward-Venne et al., 2012). Additionally, the probiotics in Greek yogurt may support gut health, which indirectly benefits nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-f0d93f91eb4fe533e899ab444a33e911 brx-content" id="brx-f0d93f91eb4fe533e899ab444a33e911"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Whey Protein Powder&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2024/05/Protein-Drinks-1024x642.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-207097" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2024/05/Protein-Drinks-600x376.jpg 600w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/05/Protein-Drinks-300x188.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/05/Protein-Drinks-768x482.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/05/Protein-Drinks-670x420.jpg 670w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/05/Protein-Drinks-150x94.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/05/Protein-Drinks-696x436.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2024/05/Protein-Drinks-822x515.jpg 822w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whey protein is the gold standard in sports nutrition. Rapidly absorbed and rich in BCAAs, it is considered the most effective supplemental protein for post-workout recovery. One 30-gram scoop generally contains 24–27 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A meta-analysis published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that whey protein supplementation significantly enhances lean muscle mass and strength when combined with resistance training (Morton et al., 2018). Its high leucine content and digestibility contribute to its superior anabolic properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Lean Beef&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean cuts of beef (e.g., sirloin, round) provide around 26 grams of protein per 100 grams and are loaded with heme iron, zinc, and B12—all vital for muscle function and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found that beef protein can stimulate MPS to a similar degree as whey when consumed post-exercise, supporting muscle development in both younger and older adults (Symons et al., 2007). Additionally, beef offers creatine, a compound that enhances ATP regeneration during training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-7f334c076c1e92e096d94a2f0e1d8dba brx-content" id="brx-7f334c076c1e92e096d94a2f0e1d8dba"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Cottage Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cottage cheese is rich in casein protein, which digests slowly and provides a sustained amino acid release, making it particularly beneficial before bed. A typical 100-gram serving contains 11 grams of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; showed that consuming casein protein before sleep increases overnight MPS, supporting muscle retention and growth during prolonged fasting periods (Res et al., 2012). This makes cottage cheese an excellent choice for nighttime nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7. Salmon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2016/05/Intermittent-fasting-salmon-tomato-olive-oil.png" alt="intermittent fasting protein sources nutrition salmon salt tomato testosterone" class="wp-image-48635" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2016/05/Intermittent-fasting-salmon-tomato-olive-oil.png 800w, https://image.boxrox.com/2016/05/Intermittent-fasting-salmon-tomato-olive-oil-300x157.png 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2016/05/Intermittent-fasting-salmon-tomato-olive-oil-768x402.png 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2016/05/Intermittent-fasting-salmon-tomato-olive-oil-150x79.png 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2016/05/Intermittent-fasting-salmon-tomato-olive-oil-696x365.png 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2016/05/Intermittent-fasting-salmon-tomato-olive-oil-600x314.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon delivers 25 grams of high-quality protein per 100 grams and is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties and support muscle recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3s enhance muscle anabolic signaling pathways. Research from the &lt;em&gt;Clinical Science Journal&lt;/em&gt; showed that EPA and DHA supplementation improves the muscle’s sensitivity to amino acids, promoting greater gains in muscle mass when combined with resistance exercise (Smith et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-b300fb18404b1661167cdd5c90be42b0 brx-content" id="brx-b300fb18404b1661167cdd5c90be42b0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;8. Lentils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentils provide around 9 grams of protein per 100 grams (cooked), making them a key plant-based protein source. They’re also high in fiber and micronutrients like iron and magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While plant proteins are often considered inferior to animal proteins in terms of amino acid profile, studies have shown that a well-planned vegetarian diet can still support muscle hypertrophy. A review in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; emphasized that combining legumes like lentils with other plant proteins can achieve a complete amino acid spectrum (Van Vliet et al., 2015).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;9. Tofu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/Tofu.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-88237" srcset="https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/Tofu-300x200.jpg 300w, https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/Tofu-768x512.jpg 768w, https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/Tofu-630x420.jpg 630w, https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/Tofu-150x100.jpg 150w, https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/Tofu-696x464.jpg 696w, https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/Tofu-822x548.jpg 822w, https://image.boxrox.com/2019/05/Tofu-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu, made from soybeans, provides 10 grams of complete protein per 100 grams and contains isoflavones that may have additional health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soy protein has been shown to support muscle protein synthesis comparably to animal sources when total protein intake is adequate. A study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology&lt;/em&gt; reported that soy protein supplementation was effective in increasing lean body mass over 12 weeks of resistance training (Hartman et al., 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-035464a2543c2215a2a8018ce5b0126d brx-content" id="brx-035464a2543c2215a2a8018ce5b0126d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;10. Quinoa&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why It’s Essential for Muscle Growth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinoa is a rare plant-based complete protein, offering 8 grams of protein per cooked cup (185 grams), along with all nine essential amino acids and a good dose of magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scientific Backing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinoa’s protein quality and digestibility score are higher than most grains. A study published in &lt;em&gt;Food Chemistry&lt;/em&gt; rated quinoa’s amino acid composition comparable to casein, making it an ideal addition to vegetarian muscle-building diets (Tang et al., 2015). It also contains saponins and antioxidants, which may aid in recovery and inflammation control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Considerations for Muscle Growth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maximize muscle growth, total daily protein intake should range from 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight, distributed evenly across meals (Morton et al., 2018). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally critical is the timing of protein ingestion—post-workout and pre-sleep being strategic windows. Including a variety of high-quality protein sources ensures all essential amino acids are consumed, supporting both MPS and long-term lean mass accrual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="brx-7effe3fb75414a0370dadcd14aaf3974 brx-content" id="brx-7effe3fb75414a0370dadcd14aaf3974"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p id="brx-feedback-box" class="brx-feedback-box"&gt;

He was so delirious from dehydration that he had pulled the curtains off the cubicle, and was screaming ‘get me out of here.’ When I arrived at the hospital, two security guards were holding Kane down, and the nurses were standing at the end of his bed, laughing at him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But Kane, 22, was not a “troublemaker.” The student and keen amateur boxer was suffering from a rare medical condition which meant his body could not retain water and his body was dangerously high in sodium. A simple daily tablet – of desmopressin, a medication Kane had been taking before his admission – as well as sufficient fluids, would have kept him alive. But the staff treating Kane at St George’s Hospital, south London, did not understand his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2012 inquest at Westminster Coroners’ Court found that Kane’s death had been caused by a “cascade of individual failures”. Now, a new initiative by the UK’s top hormone doctors makes it significantly less likely such fatal errors will happen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Miles Levy is a consultant endocrinologist at University Hospitals of Leicester Hospital Trust and honorary professor at the University of Leicester. “When you think of people dying from dehydration, you think of third world countries, people trying desperately to get water,” he says. “But this has been happening in NHS hospitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Between 2009 and 2016 there were four reported deaths in England resulting from omission of desmopressin, and a further 56 reported incidents where dosing errors led to harm to patients. Another study showed that half of all hospital trusts have made mistakes in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The problem has been in the confusion caused by the name of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Until recently, this rare but entirely treatable disorder went by the name of diabetes insipidus. “It’s not surprising that when the word diabetes comes up, people think of sugar diabetes – probably because of the obesity epidemic,” says Prof Levy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Sugar” diabetes and prediabetes affects one in five people – &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which is linked to obesity, is becoming increasingly prevalent. But the condition suffered by Kane affects only one in 25,000. The two conditions share certain symptoms – thirst, and the passing of large quantities of urine – but that is all they have in common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thanks to a campaign by Prof Levy and his colleagues, diabetes insipidus has just been renamed as arginine vasopressin deficiency – or AVP-D. But the name change came too late for Kane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Kane was a fit, healthy, lovely boy – very into exercise, and a keen &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/workouts/boxing-abs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amateur boxer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;amateur boxer&lt;/a&gt;,” says Cronin, an NHS administrator who lives in south London. Kane was the youngest of three: Cronin is also mother to a son aged 41 and a daughter, 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita Cronin with Kane as a child&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kane’s health problems started in 2008, when was studying a social work access course at college and doing shifts in Waitrose for extra cash. “He started acting weirdly,” says Cronin, who at the time was separated from Kane’s father and is now in a new relationship. “All of a sudden, Kane felt all his strength had gone: he was too tired to go running or the gym. This was really unlike him – but like a typical boy of his age, he batted off our suggestions to go to the doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On Father’s Day in August 2009, Kane “started vomiting black stuff” and was rushed to St George’s by ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The hospital that was to be responsible for Kane’s death, initially saved his life. “Kane had a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/craig-russell-brain-tumour/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:benign brain tumour;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;benign brain tumour&lt;/a&gt;, which was pressing on his pituitary gland,” says Cronin. The pituitary is pea-sized gland in the base of the brain which releases life-preserving hormones and controls the function of the other glands in the body. “He underwent immediate surgery to remove the tumour, later followed by a course of radiotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kane was a ‘fit, healthy, lovely boy’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A strong young man, Kane started to make a full recovery, but was left with serious, life-long consequences. The damage to his pituitary gland meant that he now had AVP-D, which meant his body now produced too much urine, and he wasn’t able to retain water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The solution to controlling Kane’s condition was very straightforward,” says his mother. “All he had to do was take one tablet a day.” Desmopressin, a synthetic form of the hormone vasopressin, would act on Kane’s kidneys to preserve water and prevent him becoming dehydrated. “The doctor drummed into Kane how vital it was to take his daily desmopressin,” says Cronin. “Kane also knew how devastating it would be to miss it, that his life would be in danger if he did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Three months after Kane’s surgery, he started to experience &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/broken-hip-osteoporosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain in his hip;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;pain in his hip&lt;/a&gt;: a side effect of the treatment for his tumour. His medical team decided he needed a hip operation, so Kane returned to St George’s. “This was entirely routine and we weren’t worried about it at all,” Cronin explains. “We knew of course it was vital that Kane continued to take his desmopressin. We actually offered to give it to him ourselves every morning, but the nurses said no, this wasn’t allowed – they would have to administer any drugs themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The operation went well. “The night after he came round, Kane rang his friend and told him he was settling into a comfortable night watching&lt;em&gt; Britain’s Got Talent&lt;/em&gt; and Man United,” says Cronin. “I went to bed, happy in the thought he was recovering, and in safe hands. But the next morning I got a frantic call from Kane saying: ‘Mum – I need a drink, I really need a drink!’ Because Kane was incapacitated from his operation, he couldn’t get out of bed himself – but he said the nurses were unwilling to bring him water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kane pictured with his brother&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Cronin arrived at the hospital, she was faced with the spectacle of a giggling crowd of ward staff standing around her son’s bed. “Kane was definitely acting out of character, shouting and rambling,” she says. “It didn’t dawn on me that he had not been given his medication. I had no idea his behaviour was a symptom of dehydration and I was actually concerned his brain tumour had come back.” Kane’s hip specialist was off work that day, and the endocrinologist who knew about his pituitary issues was on holiday – the junior doctors seemed unable or unwilling to explain what was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The ward care assistant reassured Cronin that her son had drunk a small amount of water, and so she returned to work&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;“Then, a few hours later, I got another call from Kane telling me he was so thirsty, he had called 999,” she says. “I made my way to the hospital, the police came and went before I got there and the duty team called the psychiatry and neurology departments for advice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The latter didn’t arrive, but a duty psychiatrist arrived, and gave Kane a large dose of diazepam, a powerful sedative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Before he fell asleep, Kane did an enormous pee in a bottle: there was so much fluid, it was overflowing,” says Cronin. “The &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/urine-colour-smell-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:liquid was the colour of plain water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;liquid was the colour of plain water&lt;/a&gt;. I took this as a good sign – that he was probably drinking enough. But I am not medically trained and I’ve since learnt this should have been a huge warning to the team looking after him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kane was left to “sleep off” his agitation in a side room and no staff came to see him. The next morning, Cronin was alarmed at her son’s appearance. “He was staring at the ceiling, his lips and tongue were alarmingly swollen,” she says. “I said to the nurse on duty, ‘is he OK?’ She just tutted and said: ‘He’s had his breakfast.’ I later discovered this was a lie. So I went back into the room and held Kane’s hand, crying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It finally dawned on Cronin that her son might not have had his medication. The team batted her away until finally she managed to persuade a senior doctor to take a look at Kane. “The next thing I knew, people were rushing into the room, and I was told to wait outside,” says Cronin. No one took the time to explain that this was the resuscitation team, arriving to try and save her son’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eventually, Cronin heard the voice of an endocrinology consultant – a specialism in Kane’s pituitary condition. “He said to me: ‘You’d better go in and see your son, he’s dying.’ The doctor sounded absolutely furious,’” she recalls. The consultant’s fury was with the duty medical team, but in that moment, it felt to Cronin that his ire was directed at her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By the time Cronin went into the room, Kane was no longer alive. “I was in such shock that I rang my boss and said: ‘You’ll never guess what happened, they have killed my son,” she says. The family were utterly shocked and devastated. How could this happen on a British hospital ward in the 21st century?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I will never get over losing my son but I’m glad that we started the ball rolling to change the way this illness is treated’ - Christopher Pledger&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kane’s death certificate said he had died as a result of a “water deficit” and “hypernatraemia” – a medical term for high sodium levels, usually caused by dehydration. The case was deemed serious enough for the coroner to suggest Cronin involve the police. “Kane was undoubtedly let down by incompetence of staff, poor communication, lack of leadership, both medical and nursing, a culture of assumption,” said the corner at the inquest, three years later. The hospital admitted neglect, and apologised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Among the issues raised at the inquest was a discussion of the appropriateness of the name diabetes insipidus. Similar cases followed: in 2018, Charlie Edwards, 48, went into a coma in a south-western UK hospital after staff were unable to read a consultant’s illegible notes and reduced his desmopressin: Edwards never regained consciousness. The hospital has apologised for a “failings with care” and a coroner’s case is imminent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, in 2022, a group of international experts including Prof Levy published their &lt;a class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9759163/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:proposal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; for a new name for diabetes insipidus. The change to AVP-D was announced last year by the clinical terminology register, followed by the World Health Organisation’s diagnostic book. Medical textbooks and online searches are also now being altered to reflect the new name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next step is to raise greater public awareness of AVP-D so that fewer fatal mistakes are made. “It’s tragic that Kane was not treated as he should have been and he lost his life when something so basic as giving him desmopressin and fluids would have helped,” says Prof Levy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cronin is happy to see the change. “Hopefully, the letters AVP-D mean that doctors will stop, think and look up this unfamiliar condition,” she says. “I will never get over losing my son but I’m glad that we started the ball rolling to change the way this illness is treated. It will mean his death wasn’t totally in vain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/customer/subscribe/01doysa/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

			&lt;p&gt;A cruel consequence of advanced  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="157958" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the profound apathy many patients experience as they lose interest in once-cherished activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This symptom is part of a syndrome called cachexia, which affects about &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/research/cachexia"&gt;80% of late-stage cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;, leading to severe muscle wasting and weight loss that leave patients bone thin despite adequate nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This loss of motivation doesn't just deepen patients' suffering, it isolates them from family and friends. Because patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5476"&gt;struggle to engage with demanding therapies&lt;/a&gt; that require effort and persistence, it also strains families and complicates treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors typically assume that when late-stage cancer patients withdraw from life, it is an inevitable &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2354.2002.00283.x"&gt;psychological response to physical deterioration&lt;/a&gt;. But what if apathy isn't just a byproduct of physical decline but an integral part of the disease itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our newly published research, my colleagues &lt;a href="https://kepecslab.org/"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; have discovered something remarkable: Cancer doesn't simply waste the body – it &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;hijacks a specific brain circuit that controls motivation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, challenge decades of assumptions and suggest it might be possible to restore what many cancer patients describe as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/ppo.0b013e3181f45b90"&gt;most devastating to lose&lt;/a&gt; – their will to engage with life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Untangling fatigue from physical decline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To unravel the puzzle of apathy in cancer cachexia, we needed to trace the exact path inflammation takes in the body and peer inside a living brain while the disease is progressing – something impossible in people. However, neuroscientists have advanced technologies that make this possible in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern neuroscience equips us with a powerful &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/illuminating-the-brain-one-neuron-and-synapse-at-a-time-5-essential-reads-about-how-researchers-are-using-new-tools-to-map-its-structure-and-function-187607"&gt;arsenal of tools&lt;/a&gt; to probe how disease changes brain activity in mice. Scientists can &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/mapping-how-the-100-billion-cells-in-the-brain-all-fit-together-is-the-brave-new-world-of-neuroscience-170182"&gt;map entire brains&lt;/a&gt; at the cellular level, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/illuminating-the-brain-one-neuron-and-synapse-at-a-time-5-essential-reads-about-how-researchers-are-using-new-tools-to-map-its-structure-and-function-187607"&gt;track neural activity&lt;/a&gt; during behavior, and precisely &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/brain-stimulation-can-rewire-and-heal-damaged-neural-connections-but-it-isnt-clear-how-research-suggests-personalization-may-be-key-to-more-effective-therapies-182491"&gt;switch neurons on or off&lt;/a&gt;. We used these neuroscience tools in a mouse model of cancer cachexia to study the effects of the disease on the brain and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a small brain region called the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1073858407311100"&gt;area postrema&lt;/a&gt; that acts as the brain's inflammation detector. As a tumor grows, it releases cytokines − molecules that trigger inflammation − into the bloodstream. The area postrema lacks the typical blood-brain barrier that keeps out toxins, pathogens and other molecules from the body, allowing it to directly sample circulating inflammatory signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the area postrema detects a rise in inflammatory molecules, it triggers a neural cascade across multiple brain regions, ultimately suppressing dopamine release in the brain's motivation center − the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.03.003"&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While commonly misconstrued as a "pleasure chemical," dopamine is actually associated with drive, or the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/422573a"&gt;willingness to put in effort to gain rewards&lt;/a&gt;: It tips the internal cost-benefit scale toward action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/660902/original/file-20250409-56-7jk4kj.png?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;directly observed this shift&lt;/a&gt; using two quantitative tests designed with behavioral economics principles to measure effort. In the first, mice repeatedly poked their noses into a food port, with progressively more pokes required to earn each food pellet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second task, mice repeatedly crossed a bridge between two water ports, each gradually depleting with use and forcing the mice to switch sides to replenish the supply, similar to picking berries until a bush is empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cancer progressed, mice still pursued easy rewards but quickly abandoned tasks requiring greater effort. Meanwhile, we watched dopamine levels fall in real time, precisely mirroring the mice's decreasing willingness to work for rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that cancer isn't just generally "wearing out" the brain − it sends targeted inflammatory signals that the brain detects. The brain then responds by rapidly reducing dopamine levels to &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;dial down motivation&lt;/a&gt;. This matches what patients describe: "Everything feels too hard."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Restoring motivation in late-stage disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most exciting, we found &lt;a href="https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm8857"&gt;several ways to restore motivation&lt;/a&gt; in mice suffering from cancer cachexia − even when the cancer itself continued progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, by genetically switching off the inflammation-sensing neurons in the area postrema, or by directly stimulating neurons to release dopamine, we were able to restore normal motivation in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we found that giving mice a drug that blocks a particular cytokine − working similarly to existing FDA-approved arthritis treatments − also proved effective. While the drug did not reverse physical wasting, it restored the mice's willingness to work for rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these results are based on mouse models, they suggest a treatment possibility for people: Targeting this specific inflammation-dopamine circuit could improve quality of life for cancer patients, even when the disease remains incurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boundary between physical and psychological symptoms is an &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/"&gt;artificially drawn line&lt;/a&gt;. Cancer ignores this division, using inflammation to commandeer the very circuits that drive a patient's will to act. But our findings suggest these messages can be intercepted and the circuits restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rethinking apathy in disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our discovery has implications far beyond cancer. The inflammatory molecule driving loss of motivation in cancer is also &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/2011/765624"&gt;involved in numerous other conditions&lt;/a&gt; − from autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis to chronic infections and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="157958" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This same brain circuit might explain the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13072058"&gt;debilitating apathy&lt;/a&gt; that millions of people suffering from various chronic diseases experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apathy triggered by inflammation may have originally &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2015.5"&gt;evolved as a protective mechanism&lt;/a&gt;. When early humans faced acute infections, dialing down motivation made sense − it conserved energy and directed resources toward recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what once helped people survive short-term illnesses turns harmful when inflammation persists chronically, as it does in cancer and other diseases. Rather than &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/feeling-sick-is-an-emotion-meant-to-help-you-get-better-faster-126915"&gt;aiding survival&lt;/a&gt;, prolonged apathy deepens suffering, worsening health outcomes and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While translating these findings into therapies for people requires more research, our discovery reveals a promising target for treatment. By intercepting inflammatory signals or modulating brain circuits, researchers may be able to restore a patient's drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients and families watching motivation slip away, that possibility offers something powerful: hope that even as disease progresses, the essence of who we are might be reclaimed.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254043/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

He didn't go completely through the window and his hip to his legs were hanging out so he was able to pull himself back in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Horrifying images show a gaping &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14333019/Pictured-mother-died-chiropractor-neck-crack-workout.html"&gt;four inch wide, 1.5 inch deep hole&lt;/a&gt; running across his neck, from the mouth to his ear - barely missing his jugular veins that are responsible for bringing blood back from the brain to the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aceson Dubois, now five, nearly died last year after he went through a window and ended up with a massive wound on his neck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even minor damage to the jugular veins can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage, blood clots in the vein, inflammation of the vein wall and infections - all of which could cause serious brain damage and heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alyssa is now calling on parents to protect their children by installing safety guards all around their homes and learn how to treat wounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Remembering how she attempted first aid to&lt;span&gt; stop the flow of 'spitting' blood and waited for emergency services, the young mother said: 'I was terrified, I thought that was it. I thought he had hit a main artery and was going to die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I grabbed his neck and pinched everything I could. I used the laundry that we had on the couch and I began to stuff his neck and had [the wound] closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My hands were slipping all over my son because of all the blood all over him. He was just screaming on the porch and kept saying "mommy, please don't let me die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It [the glass] missed his jugular [veins] by an inch. He ended up slicing his saliva gland in half and the bottom half of his ear off.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The saliva, or salivary, glands are located in the head and neck region and are responsible for lubricating the mouth, swallowing, digestion and protect teeth against harmful bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Aceson reached the McLeod Regional Medical Center in Florence, South Carolina, he immediately underwent a two-hour emergency surgery to have his neck, saliva gland and ear stitched back together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alyssa said: 'The whole time while I was waiting for him to come out of his first surgery, I couldn't stop shaking and I felt sick. After surgery, when I went in to see him, I looked at him asleep and it broke my heart into a million pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was happy because I knew he was going to live but the darker side of me was like this is what I'd be looking at if he didn't make it through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What broke my heart the most was he turned to me and said, "thank you for not letting me die."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aceson had a second surgery to a week later to remove some stitches and was discharged to make a full recovery at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year later from the accident, Aceson has no permanent nerve damage and is healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Aceson underwent a surgery at the McLeod Regional Medical Center in Florence, South Carolina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, both Aceson, now five, and Alyssa have been diagnosed with PTSD and are receiving counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The terrified mother revealed that the kindergartener is fearful of going near windows and every time Alyssa hears a loud noise, she gets anxious her kids could be hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, she has removed the window Aceson fell through from her mobile home and has covered others with furniture to help stop a repeat of the tragic accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now urging parents to childproof their homes and to educate themselves on basic first aid training so they know how to stop bleeding fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts note that common ways to childproof your home include securing heavy furniture, covering outlets, installing safety latches on cabinets and drawers and using baby gates to restrict access to dangerous areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alyssa is also warning other parents to learn how to pack a wound - which involves putting materials such as gauze into the wound to help control bleeding and prevent infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She shared: 'At the time of the accident, I was healthcare trained so I was very knowledgeable and knew what I needed to do to help control the bleeding before we got to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The terrified mother revealed that the toddler is fearful of going near windows and every time she hears a loud noise, she gets anxious her kids could be hurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A year later from the accident, Aceson has no permanent nerve damage and is healthy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Learning how to properly pack a wound when there is uncontrollable bleeding is something every mom should know. Not even just moms, people in general should know how to do this.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She specifies that parents should ensure their windows are made of shatterproof glass and tape gymnastic mats in corners and on windows to safeguard young children.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year, about 2,300 children younger than 15 years die from unintentional injuries in their homes and over 3.4 million children experience an unintentional home-related injury in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the World Health Organization estimates that about 270,000 children under the age of five die each year from accidents at home across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Childproofing could prevent an estimated 55 percent of household injuries in children 10 years old and younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 01:55:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQZVA5X1cyRG82RGFWTGcyVUlTcWNCRjd4NnNoQ0J3ckJnSzRuMHc1NEpVY1p0UXZLWkRhNTJpTThvS0tJekJZNHJOb0JSd0VLd241ekphZDBkRkw1Ym9hRmF5WnhQWlppY3J5V0JRMVlOYXA4Q0VITVN6Tm5IOWUtallZQk0tdG9QaUlJbUZPQ0hjTGs4MlRjS0doajVXOC1JOTgtbFRnc3ctUdIBrwFBVV95cUxPV3pCd2JkUGktcTNZYVRrS1NpMm1fRGlSbWhlSkR1Z2NEcm5MQXJlZlVzYzNzQzhjLWs2cXdRYzhWWEZucHRxcHNyMUFSb1RaYlh2VmVSZkRQeXRYTEMweXhEa2Znc0dTcnJRR005dmVjQmZGZmxYSzg2S19zaXM5SmhwakttSEdSUVAtLW9ILW1FVUFCWG5sUXpfYWtJRjdGaHF1M29jbHZYNmNXRTcw</guid></item><item><title>Plastic surgeon reveals the SAFEST body alteration you could ever make - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic surgery is becoming increasingly popular in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And with the rising rates of people going under the knife comes the question of safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You've heard a lot about some of the more dangerous surgical procedures like BBLs, but what about some of the procedures that are the safest? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Arnold S. Breitbart has been a plastic surgeon for more than 30 years and he has now told DailyMail.com that the safest plastic surgical procedures are the minimally invasive ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in his opinion, one of the absolute safest body alterations is &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/liposuction/index.html" id="mol-2d570860-163d-11f0-a7fe-b90172f5b10b"&gt;liposuction&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The incisions are tiny and the procedure is commonly performed in an office operating room, usually under local anesthesia,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart has been performing liposuction procedures for as long as he's been a plastic surgeon and has done thousands on this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, they're so common that he does several of these surgeries a week in his office operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Arnold Breitbart has been a plastic surgeon for more than 30 years and says liposuction is one of the safest procedures possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Breitbart performs several liposuction surgeries a week (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I operate with advanced liposuction techniques such as SmartLipo, which uses a laser during the liposuction procedure to make the liposuction more effective,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart explained that these liposuction procedures are likely popular because they're ideal for patients who may be close to their ideal weight, but have areas where they want to get rid of fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that liposuction is most commonly performed on areas including the abdomen, the flanks (also known as love handles), out and inner thighs, inner knees, the back, arms, and neck.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've performed liposuction on professional models, trainers, and athletes, who despite excellent diet, exercise, and lifestyle, still have these disproportionate areas of increased fatty fullness,' Dr. Breitbart said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Liposuction may be appropriate for somewhat heavier patients, but generally not for obese patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Patients find liposuction to be a very attractive procedure, as the procedure is outpatient and the recovery is quick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while liposuction is popular, Dr. Breitbart said that he's seen an increase in patients seeking plastic surgery for the removal of lose skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is mostly due to the recent rise in GLP-1 weight loss medications like Ozempic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liposuction is typically performed on patients who might be close to their ideal weight but have a few 'problem areas' they want to fix (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In these massive weight loss patients, loose skin is a common secondary effect,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It may affect parts of the body including the abdomen, arms, breasts, and face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Procedures such as tummy tuck, arm lift, breast lift, facelift, and necklift may be indicated in these patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Breitbart agrees that patients should probably steer clear of dangerous procedures like BBLs mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In general, I discourage the use of implants placed in the buttocks, as there are increased complication rates associated with this procedure,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if you're looking for a procedure that will give you bigger buttocks, he said to at least consider a fat transfer first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
