Now, research points to a simple but powerful strategy that involves meeting a certain quota of weekly activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combing through extensive data, epidemiologist &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, San Francisco (&lt;a href="https://medicine.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;) and her colleagues noticed that many individuals start off active but lose momentum by middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline appears to drive up the risk of developing hypertension, a medical condition marked by above-normal blood pressure levels that can result in heart disease and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-blood-pressure"&gt;Understanding blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hypertension&lt;/a&gt; affects billions worldwide, placing a significant burden on public health. It develops when the force of blood against the arterial walls remains too high, which can hurt critical organs over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people live with hypertension without even realizing it, a reason it is often described as a silent condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once discovered, however, moderate to vigorous exercise has proven to be an effective way to reduce those numbers on the blood pressure gauge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-study"&gt;Inside the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 5,100 adults from four US cities contributed to this one particular study on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers took regular physical measurements and tracked each person’s exercise routines over three decades to see how consistent physical activity influenced blood pressure later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each stage, participants who logged more hours of physical effort ended up with better circulatory readings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who managed five hours of moderate exercise per week saw a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-foods-might-work-like-medicines-to-lower-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meaningful reduction&lt;/a&gt; in their chances of having high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-activity-targets-that-matter"&gt;Activity targets that matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Achieving at least twice the current minimum adult guidelines may be more beneficial for the prevention of hypertension than simply meeting the minimum guidelines,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/a&gt;, a UCSF expert in young adult medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective supports the evidence that any type of exercise can help manage blood pressure for people without advanced cardiovascular conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate exercise helps the body regulate blood vessels and hormones linked to stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that staying active consistently, rather than pushing hard for a short spurt, can keep the cardiovascular system on a stable path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-helps-blood-pressure"&gt;Exercise helps blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-hour weekly target mentioned in the study isn’t just a random number. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lines up with results from other &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;large-scale reviews&lt;/a&gt; showing that greater amounts of moderate aerobic activity (like brisk walking or biking) can lead to even bigger drops in systolic blood pressure, especially in people at risk but not yet diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review by the researchers confirmed this trend across 435 clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings showed that regular exercise lowered &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; by an average of 3.5 mmHg in healthy adults and by 5.5 mmHg in those with lifestyle-related diseases, including hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers matter because even small reductions can significantly lower the risk of stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-and-racial-differences"&gt;Social and racial differences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that race and social backgrounds heavily influence a person’s ability to stay &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physically active&lt;/a&gt;. At 40 years old, physical activity dipped among White men and women, yet Black men and women saw a continued decline rather than a plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 45, Black women in the study surpassed White men in the number of hypertension cases. At 60, upwards of 80 to 90 percent of Black participants were living with high blood pressure, compared to around 70 percent of White men and about half of White women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people face hidden obstacles that make it difficult to stay active over the years. Work shifts, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of access to parks, and limited time all contribute to the decline in physical &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-at-night-disrupts-sleep-and-brain-activity-especially-in-young-adults/"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt;, especially in underserved communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although Black male youth may have high engagement in sports, socioeconomic factors, neighborhood environments, and work or family responsibilities may prevent continued engagement in physical activity through adulthood,” said Nagata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that socioeconomic factors and environment weren’t directly measured in this study, but they likely played a major role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-consistent-fitness-habits"&gt;Consistent fitness habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Teenagers and those in their early 20s may be physically active but these patterns change with age,” explained Bibbins-Domingo. In earlier years, many teenagers and people in their early 20s get daily movement through sports and outdoor activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This might be especially the case after high school when opportunities for physical &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; diminish,” said Nagata. At some point, life’s responsibilities can interfere with exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health advocates often focus on educating children and adolescents about adopting active lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in this study highlight how those messages remain vital for maintaining heart health as people transition to jobs, parenthood, and hectic schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-exercise-and-heart-health"&gt;Blood pressure, exercise, and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week for adults, though this research suggests going beyond that threshold offers clear advantages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding structured workouts or simple movement like brisk walks can be powerful steps in lowering long-term risk of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a committed exercise routine takes extra planning as the years go by. However, the rewards include protecting the heart, keeping &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; vessels flexible, and minimizing the negative effects of chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying consistent with physical activity offers a chance to lower the probability of hypertension before serious complications set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-024-01974-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 14:41:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxOVlR4OXpBeC1TZ0lpNHRubGMtZ1BhSFNPTkIyZ2VQSnJCS29wNDNkaGhRTG1BcWs0b2xkVXRNV2NnUjdxLXFoM3JvZzNrNHh5MzN0aWt2TmpOVjY0dVpZXzMzMnBjZmRsUGYxX3lRNTJBbWJ1NGd3VGEzTnFoTGZrZ05mR0ZRM1djZHFwTDZHVGFFclJkZTVkZjV0d1VpYkZqeEY3bzhaaTIxTF9EOVJ4dmhMZ0d4YUtMc1puVDhB</guid></item><item><title>餐厅受到Hickman Farms禽流感疫情的打击- ABC15亚利桑那州 | Restaurants take hit with Hickman Farms bird flu outbreak - ABC15 Arizona</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPMGJaVmFub3pKNUxnT3VCekVMajZQQmFUbllsSVZXcmV5cWlYWm1WcTNTSDFIamVyaFU4b09xWDlRalduOXVIWUlWZFJGLXZaSXM4TUhIc2pkNkI2YmRCLUp1NnUwS1FXbS1VZFJiZHAtNnRHSW9zQjNfbWFEaUlSdWxCeUVvbk5qUkVtTnNmZENGejlWZmxqMlJCWUZEVEk3RXlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — Even as &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/rising-egg-prices-taking-a-toll-on-valley-restaurants"&gt;sky-high egg prices&lt;/a&gt; have eased, a new problem is emerging for local restaurants and food vendors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.abc15.com/news/state/third-case-of-bird-flu-detected-at-commercial-farm-in-maricopa-county"&gt;bird flu at Hickman’s Farms&lt;/a&gt; created another hurdle for the local food industry, as the farm is one of the largest egg suppliers in the southwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carolina's Mexican Food uses Hickman’s Farms eggs for their breakfast burritos, and one of their suppliers, Merit Foods, told ABC15 the West Valley farm was their only supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;We follow up with their owner and others as they look to navigate another hurdle with the egg industry in the video player above.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They warned that the U.S. could be at the mercy of other countries in the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The administration's actions are gutting our deterrence from biological threats," said Beth Cameron, a senior adviser to the Brown University Pandemic Center and a former director at the White House National Security Council. "Canceling this investment is a signal that we are changing our posture on pandemic preparedness," she added, "and that is not good for the American people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Flu pandemics killed up to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://news.emory.edu/features/2018/10/flu-pandemic/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;103 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide last century, researchers estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In anticipation of the next big one, the U.S. government began bolstering the nation's pandemic flu defenses during the George W. Bush administration. These strategies were designed by the security council and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the Department of Health and Human Services, among other agencies. The plans rely on rolling out vaccines rapidly in a pandemic. Moving fast hinges on producing vaccines domestically, ensuring their safety and getting them into arms across the nation through the public health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Trump administration is undermining each of these steps as it guts health agencies, cuts research and health budgets and issues perplexing policy changes, health security experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since President Donald Trump took office, at least half of the security council's staff have been laid off or left, and the future of BARDA is murky.

"When the need hits and we aren't ready, no other country will come to our rescue and we will suffer greatly," said Rick Bright, an immunologist and a former BARDA director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Countries that produced their own vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic had &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02383-z" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;first dibs&lt;/a&gt; on the shots. While the United States, home to Moderna and Pfizer, rolled out second doses of mRNA vaccines in 2021, hundreds of thousands of people in countries that didn't manufacture vaccines died waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The most pertinent pandemic threat today is the bird flu virus H5N1. Researchers around the world &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-ground-zero-texas-dairy-farms-whodunit-h5n1/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;were alarmed&lt;/a&gt; when it began spreading among cattle in the U.S. last year. Cows are closer to humans biologically than birds, indicating that the virus had evolved to thrive in cells like our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As hundreds of herds and dozens of people were infected in the U.S., the Biden administration funded Moderna to develop bird flu vaccines using mRNA technology. As part of the agreement, the U.S. government stipulated it could purchase doses in advance of a pandemic. That no longer stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers can make bird flu vaccines in other ways, but mRNA vaccines are developed much more quickly because they don't rely on finicky biological processes, such as growing elements of vaccines in chicken eggs or cells kept alive in laboratory tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Time matters because flu viruses mutate constantly, and vaccines work better when they match whatever variant is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Developing vaccines within eggs or cells can take 10 months after the genetic sequence of a variant is known, Bright said. And relying on eggs presents an additional risk when it comes to bird flu because a pandemic could wipe out billions of chickens, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-potential-pandemic-vaccine-chicken-egg-quandary/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;crashing egg supplies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Decades-old methods that rely on inactivated flu viruses are riskier for researchers and time-consuming. Still the Trump administration &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;invested $500 million&lt;/a&gt; into this approach, which was largely abandoned by the 1980s after it caused seizures in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This politicized regression is baffling," Bright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A bird flu pandemic may begin quietly in the U.S. if the virus evolves to spread between people but &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-trump-immigration-raids-farmworkers-threats-california-michigan/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;no one is tested&lt;/a&gt; at first. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's dashboard suggests that only 10 farmworkers have been tested for the bird flu since March. Because of their close contact with cattle and poultry, farmworkers are at highest risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As with many diseases, only a fraction of people with the bird flu become severely sick.

However, these vaccines target an older strain of H5N1 and their efficacy against the virus circulating now is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In addition to the months it takes to develop an updated version within eggs or cells, Rasmussen questioned the ability of the government to rapidly test and license updated shots, with a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-doge-federal-job-cuts.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;quarter of HHS staff gone&lt;/a&gt;. If the Senate approves Trump's proposed budget, the agency faces about $32 billion in cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Further, the Trump administration's cuts to biomedical research and its push to slash grant money for overhead costs could undermine academic hospitals, rendering them unable to conduct large clinical trials. And its cuts to the CDC and to public health funds to states mean that fewer health officials will be available in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"You can't just turn this all back on," Rasmussen said. "The longer it takes to respond, the more people die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers suggest other countries would produce bird flu vaccines first. "The U.S. may be on the receiving end like India was, where everyone -- rich people, too -- got vaccines late," said Achal Prabhala, a public health researcher in India at medicines access group AccessIBSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He sits on the board of a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://medicinespatentpool.org/what-we-do/mrna-technology-transfer-programme" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;World Health Organization initiative&lt;/a&gt; to improve access to mRNA vaccines in the next pandemic. A member of the initiative, the company Sinergium Biotech in Argentina, is testing an mRNA vaccine against the bird flu. If it works, Sinergium will share the intellectual property behind the vaccine with about a dozen other groups in the program from middle-income countries so they can produce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international partnership headquartered in Norway, is providing funds to research groups developing rapid-response vaccine technology, including mRNA, in South Korea, Singapore and France. And CEPI committed up to $20 million to efforts to prepare for a bird flu pandemic. This year, the Indian government issued a call for grant applications to develop mRNA vaccines for the bird flu, warning it "poses a grave public health risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Pharmaceutical companies are investing in mRNA vaccines for the bird flu as well. However, Prabhala says private capital isn't sufficient to bring early-stage vaccines through clinical trials and large-scale manufacturing. That's because there's no market for bird flu vaccines until a pandemic hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Limited supplies means the United States would have to wait in line for mRNA vaccines made abroad. States and cities may compete against one another for deals with outside governments and companies, like they did for medical equipment at the peak of the covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I fear we will once again see the kind of hunger games we saw in 2020," Cameron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In an email response to queries, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, "We concluded that continued investment in Moderna's H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable." He added, "The decision reflects broader concerns about the use of mRNA platforms -- particularly in light of mounting evidence of adverse events associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Nixon did not back up the claim by citing analyses published in scientific journals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office of the White House, June 5, 2025, in Washington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Chris Kleponis/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/11/6/1118" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;dozens of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320525002449?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;published studies&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have found that mRNA vaccines against COVID are safe.

Sometimes, it is recommended to also take vitamin C, which can help the body absorb iron more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is already known that iron plays a role in organ development, and another recent study showed babies born to mothers with low iron levels were more likely to suffer heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the new evidence suggests the mineral could also influence the development of sex organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recent study is the first time a dietary mineral has been found to trigger intersex, which occurs in one to two percent of the population, and while the team said there hasn't been any research to make this link in humans, they believe it could play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead researcher Vincent Harley, a molecular geneticist at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia, said this 'presents an exciting new area of study.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Not getting enough iron during pregnancy could raise the risk of babies being born intersex, a study suggests &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intersex is a condition in which individuals have genitals or reproductive organs that do not fit the typical binary definitions of male or female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who are intersex may also have chromosomes that differ from the typical male and female binary. Their genitals may not match their reproductive organs or they may have traits of both. This can include variations in e&lt;span&gt;xternal or internal reproductive organs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mammals, biological sex is determined by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome — females typically have XX chromosomes whereas males typically have XY ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, a primary gene is responsible for formation of the corresponding sexual organs, such as testicles and penis or ovaries and vagina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mice, for instance, with XY chromosomes usually develop testes if a gene called 'Sry' (Sex-determining Region Y gene) is activated and ovaries if it is not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers behind this latest study had previously shown that Sry is activated by an enzyme called 'histone demethylase,' which needs iron to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their new lab tests, they looked at how iron levels would therefore impact the development of sexual&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14732945/fertility-female-experts-improve-birth-rate-decline.html"&gt; organs in unborn babies. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of their trials, the researchers gave mice with low levels of histone demethylase an iron-deficient diet for a month before pregnancy and for two weeks during pregnancy, and compared them with mice that were fed a control diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells were lower among iron-deficient mice than in the control-diet mice, as expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But two of the 43 male babies carried by iron-deficient mothers also developed female-typical sex organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All the control mice grew sex organs typical of their chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other tests, which dug into the impact of iron further, revealed similar results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Iron deficiency during pregnancy is most often caused by a lack of iron in the diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study, four mice with XY (typical male) chromosomes were born with two ovaries and one with one ovary and one testis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could be posited that when iron levels are low, the enzyme 'histone demethylase' may not activate the Sry gene, which is responsible for the development of male sex organs and reproductive organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, mice with XY chromosomes may develop female - or both types of - organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging evidence suggests maternal diet and exposure to environmental toxins can affect gene activity involved in the early development of testes and ovaries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The latest findings could have implications for medical advice about iron intake during pregnancy, Harley adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A separate study investigating the link between iron and organ development found b&lt;/span&gt;abies born to mothers with low iron levels are far more likely to suffer heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists now posit anemia - low levels of red blood cells due to low iron levels - in pregnant women may be to blame for about one in 20 congenital heart disease (CHD) cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deadly condition is one of the most common types of birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, by the British Heart Foundation, analyzed the data of 16,500 mothers and found the chances of having a child with CHD was 47 percent greater in women with low iron levels in their first 100 days of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts will now investigate whether taking iron supplements before and during pregnancy could help prevent heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of scientific investigations have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="164012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may not be merely a condition of an aging brain, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;but the product of infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly spread&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" wf_caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains&lt;/em&gt; (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Welcome to Chasing Life and welcome to Summertime. You know, it's that time of year. Barbecues, baseball games, the beach, lounging by the pool, maybe lounging by the lake like we do in my home state of Michigan. I love summertime. But you know, summertime also means heat and for our bodies, that means sweat. We all sweat every day. Some of us more than others, yes, but nothing to be ashamed of. You certainly know that sweat is our body's natural cooling system. There's been all this research recently telling us that sweat can do a lot more than just turn down our body's temperature. Each droplet of sweat could be full of signs and signals about what's going on deep inside our bodies. Sweat could be the key to understanding not only our hydration, but also our nutrient levels, our kidney health. Sweat is a lot fascinating than you probably ever realized. And today I'm sitting down one of the scientists who's leading that research. His name is Professor John Rogers, and he is director of Northwestern's Querry Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics. He is an expert on sweat, and he's gonna talk me through the basics of sweat, but also its potential, and help me understand how sweat could save a lot of lives and help us all perform at our very best. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:01:37
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              First of all, just some terms. What is sweat?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So sweat is a fluid created by glands that exist about a millimeter below the surface of the skin. These glands connect to ducts that transport sweat generated by the glands to the surface of the skin. The density of sweat glands is highest on the fingertips about 400 glands per square centimeter.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:01
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              On your fingertips? I didn't realize that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, if you look at the sort of the magnified view of your fingertips, the sweat pores exist on the upper surfaces of the ridges of the texture of the skin of the fingertips. So quite a lot of sweat will come out of your finger tips. You get sweaty palms, you know, you feel nervous or something like that, you're exercising. But you have also sweat glands distributed across your entire body, obviously not just your fingertips. So there's pretty high density of sweat glands in your forehead. About a hundred and fifty sweat glands per square centimeter on your forearms uh... Maybe half of that on your back and your your abdomen that kind of thing so there are two classes of sweat glands one is called eccrine sweat glands uh... And those are the ones that i just referred to. There are other sweat glands that a little bit different and they involve a more complex chemistry associated with the sweat those are that apocrine glands they exist the armpits the genital regions and so on.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:02:59
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Most people hear sweat and they think... I get hot, I sweat. That helps my body cool down. Is that the primary reason we sweat?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Primarily, that is the reason for thermal regulation, so maintaining thermal homeostasis. So sweating is triggered when the core body temperature rises above a certain threshold, and then the rate of sweating is determined by the external temperature and humidity level and so on. But sweating can also be induced by nervousness. There are sort of emotional cues that will cause a sweating. You're really nervous in an interview, you will start to sweat.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:35
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Are you sweating now?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Not yet, yeah. We'll see how it goes. And there are different kinds of foods that you can eat, right, that will cause sweat.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:03:43
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So you mentioned three reasons that we sweat to cool the body when we may be nervous and maybe in response to certain foods. Is the sweat different depending on what the stimulus for the sweat?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              It's more or less the same, although the chemical composition of sweat can depend on sweat rate and the total volume of sweat that's been lost. So if you sweat very quickly, for example, at a high rate of sweating, the chloride concentration can be higher than its slow rates of sweating. So there are some dependencies there on the rate and the amount of sweat has been lost, but not so much on the mechanism by which the sweat is induced.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:04:25
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Is your sweat fundamentally going to be similar to my sweat? Is there variation from human to human?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So there's quite a large variation in the electrolyte level in sweat, and that's just genetically determined. It can be modulated by that, but there's sort of genetic baseline that determines your kind of average electrolyte levels. But it can be modulated by dietary habits, it can modulated be the amount of exercise you're doing, your fitness levels, that kind of thing. But for more basic biochemical species, let's say creatinine and urea, which we'll talk about in a little bit in the context of kidney health. That tends, what we're seeing in the data is that those two biochemicals species in sweat correlate very nicely with the same species in blood.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:15
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Now I do want to take a moment here and explain a couple things. First of all, the reason sweat carries the same biomarkers as blood is because they have something in common: interstitial fluid. Interstitial fluid comes from blood as it's traveling through small blood vessels or capillaries. It's found throughout the body and its main function is to transport oxygen and other nutrients to cells and also remove waste from cells. But here's the thing: When sweat glands are activated, they are pulling from that same interstitial fluid, which then diffuses across layers of skin to become sweat. The second thing you're gonna hear us talk a lot about the concept of correlation. Specifically, whether or not certain levels of biomarkers detected in sweat could have the same medical significance if found in blood. When I went to the doctor, I got my blood drawn and everything, they're measuring basic chemistries, my sodium, my potassium, chloride, things like that. They might also measure my cholesterol and lipids and things like that. What can sweat measure?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So for the things that we're looking at specifically, it's electrolyte level, electrolyte replenishment becomes very important for athletes, for workers in oil and gas manufacturing, construction, that kind of thing. Chloride for cystic fibrosis diagnostics, we published on that and we've done studies on large cohorts of infants. Kidney health is one that we think is really, really interesting. Looking at creatinine and urea concentrations in sweat, as I mentioned. We're also very interested in sweat, the nutritional biomarkers that are in sweat. So we have assays for vitamin D9, vitamin C, calcium, zinc, and iron. And we're in the process of establishing whether those species in sweat also correlate with species in blood. That's ongoing work. But I think that would be very powerful because you would be able to assess nutritional balance very quickly, right? And I think especially in lower and middle income countries. Nutritional deficiencies in pediatric patients can cause health challenges throughout an individual's life.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:24
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We're going to take a quick break here, but when we come back, I'm in the hot seat.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Take a look and see if you've started sweating.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              They say to never let them see you sweat, well for me, that's about to change. Last year I decided to go pay Professor John Rogers a visit at his lab at Northwestern.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              All right, welcome to our testing facility.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              He had one goal for me.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So we have a portable sauna here. It's going to replicate the environment that you would.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:07:54
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              And that's right, in the lab was a portable sauna. Picture of this small tent where your entire body is zipped in, except for your head. And then the temperature inside that tent is cranked up to a cozy about 135 degrees Fahrenheit. And the whole point is to get me to sweat, which you can probably see that I'm starting to do, having been in here for about 15 minutes. Now, while I was in the sauna, Professor Rogers had me wear this small patch that he and his team had designed. This patch sticks straight onto your skin. And then on the backside there are these reservoir channels. If you're looking at it, it basically looks like a semiconductor. Now when a person sweats, or in this case when I sweat, the channels fill with that sweat and turns the patch different colors to correlate with different levels of biomarkers in your body. What is interesting though, is that they're basically trying to measure sweat on my arms here. And you can tell on this one, for example, that I've started to sweat. You can see some sweat on my arm. This is measuring all these different things, ketones, chloride, All these things that you'd normally get tested with a blood draw by sticking a needle in your arm. Now, you don't need to be in...
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Let's take a look and see if.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:09
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I'm starting to feel it a little bit, about 12 minutes.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Not much yet on that side, why don't we check the other device. So it's started to fill. There's chloride assays over here, so you're seeing a slight pink color, which means probably chloride concentration around 10 millimolar, 15, something that range. Great job. Thank you.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:09:30
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I sat here and did nothing, literally.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, yeah. Well, your sweat glands did something. They're working.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:09:39
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Finding a way to actually collect the sweat, that has been the key in studying it. You know, I think it's sort of fascinating. I remember thinking this before I met you, but then sort of reflecting on it afterwards, this idea that we study blood, we have all sorts of different ways of imaging the body. Why weren't we studying sweat all along? It seems like an easy one to sort of study.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think probably the reason why it hasn't sort of taken off earlier is it's just difficult to collect pristine uncontaminated volumes of sweat. In the early days, you'd use like a device to kind of scrape along the surface of the skin, sort of collect enough sweat that you can get it into a pipette or a syringe or a vial or something like that. The other way to do it is you have like an absorbent pad and a layer of tape on top of it and you kind of put it down and then you peel it off bring the sweat out of the pad, but kind of clumsy approaches overall. So I think that was kind of a missing element, kind of an engineering mechanism for collecting volumes of sweat in a very reliable, reproducible way.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:10:48
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Was it just the, as you call it, the clumsiness that led to this sort of being under-studied, or do you think there was just so much inertia around blood and urine and things like that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Well, probably a combination of both. I do think there was sort of this missing capacity for collecting tiny volumes of sweat and manipulating those. There's no question that that did not exist prior to maybe 2016 or so. So that was definitely a shift. The other thing may be a broader societal change where there's a greater and greater appreciation of sort of continuous health monitoring using non-invasive sort of wearable devices, you know, whether that's a you know, a watch type device that goes on your wrist or something that goes on your finger or what we've been interested in, sort of soft skin adherent patches, essentially, be placed on anatomically relevant locations of the body for measuring different conditions associated with patient care. And so maybe in that context, it just makes a lot more sense to think about sweat and the ability to kind of capture that biochemical information and sort of a continuous wearable sort of platform. You put it on, sweat enters in. The color develops, you take a smartphone camera, you snap a picture of the device, it does automated color extraction, and the color then calibrates to a specific concentration of those species. So that's the way our devices work. Very simple, sort of single use device construction is the way we have it set up.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:12:21
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So it's not a binary thing because it's not just color changing. You're actually then quantifying what that color means it sounds like.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, that's right. The vibrancy of that color, the depth of that color correlates directly to a specific concentration level in a continuous manner.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:12:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Is the real secret sauce here, this figuring out of the microfluidics, is that what you're alluding to? Yeah.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, from an engineering standpoint, that's it. But as you've pointed out, really establishing through sort of medical research, what are the correlations between sweat chemistry and blood chemistry? And that's a little bit kind of outside of the domain of the microfluidic device itself, because you can in principle study those correlations with any kind of collection vehicle. I think the microfluentics allows that kind of reproducibility and precision in collecting pristine volumes of samples. Of sweat, but that's more kind of in a biology domain, figuring out those correlations. But then the engineering piece, I think it's already in place.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:13:18
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, so when it comes to sweat, then where do you think this is going to go? I mean, are you going to get better if you look at lots and lots of data, for example, blood data and sweat data, and you have these huge machine learning models now, will we get better correlating sweat with blood so that sweat becomes more meaningful? Where is this heading,?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, that's a great point. I would say, you know, this kind of machine learning models are gonna be important in really getting a very deep understanding of one's health condition from a combination of biophysical sensor outputs, as well as some of this biochemical information that we're capturing through sweat. And you collect it all together. I think it's gonna be a really powerful opportunity. So I think is a really exciting area for the future. The other thing is a lot of these species just correlate in a very natural way. It doesn't really even require machine learning. Like creatinine and urea we were just talking about, caffeine, alcohol. I think what we will find, we haven't completely proven this, there are a lot micronutrients in sweat. Vitamin C, for example, a number of different essential minerals for a healthy diet appear in sweat as well. We're very interested in pediatric health in that context. You put on a patch, you do kind of almost a full panel analysis of species relevant to a healthy nutrition. But I think there are enough reasons to be interested in sweat, again, biased perspective, that we're plenty motivated. We're gonna continue no matter what. And I think it's a great discovery area in terms of the biology. And there are some immediate applications here that don't even require these correlations to be established.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:14:56
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              What about lipids? Could lipids potentially be measured through sweat like cholesterol or triglycerides or triglycerides?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              That's a good question. We're hoping for cholesterol. We haven't found substantial amounts of it. Cortisol is an interesting one, and we just submitted a new paper on sweat cortisol. As you mentioned, there's a correlation there. The concentrations are super low. I mean, some of the challenge just is related to the very minute concentrations of some of these. More of a kind of an engineering challenge, I guess. Sweat's 99% water. It's only 1% of all of these different chemicals, you know, collected together, so they're very minute in terms of their presence. But amino acids are there, we can capture those. I think it's a really interesting discovery space, like we started talking about. There just hasn't been a lot of work on sweat, but I think a lot of the pieces are there and we're pretty excited about it.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So how has it been going? Are people using it for these purposes?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Well, so great question. So full disclosure, I'm involved in a startup company that has kind of spun out of the academic work that we do kind of in our university lab environment here. I don't have any day-to-day role. I don't have a consulting relationship, anything like that, but I am the board. So it's good to kind of disclose that. But the company is called Epicore Biosystems. And so they have a couple of large sort of customers and business relationships in sports and athletics. And in worker safety. So in those cases, you don't have to worry about correlations to blood because you're tracking sweat loss as a mechanism for determining how much water you've lost as a result of an athletic competition, a training, or if you're in the oil and gas industry, you're working in a hot human environment, you're just sweating. And it also measures electrolyte loss via that same mechanism. And that's important for sports performance because it's well known that poor hydration can lead to cramping and injury and decreased levels of performance. And so the idea is these devices can provide a precise way to determine how much body water you've lost as a result of sweating. And you can use that information to hydrate at appropriate levels. So avoid over hydrating or under hydrating. And by similar token, you can determine how much electrolyte supplement salt tablets you need to take in order to get back to where you were before you lost electrolytes by sweating. And so they have a joint product offering with Gatorade. I don't want to pitch products, but you ask. And so I think they've done about 3 million of these Gatorade, GX patches and There's an app that goes along with the patch. It works exactly the same way that I was just describing. It's a sticker, you put it on, you know, and the channels fill with sweat. You can determine the extent of filling, and then there's a colorimetric reagent. In this case, it responds to chloride concentration, which is pretty much electrostatically balanced with sodium, so it's a good indicator of overall electrolyte concentration. And with the electrolyte consideration, you determine electrolyte loss. And so that guides replenishment.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              But if I wanted to buy one, could I buy one?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, you can buy them at Dick's Sporting Goods. You can order them off of the Gatorade website. They're bundled in many cases with the GX bottles and the pods and that whole thing. So I think they're about $10 for a pack of two kind of in that.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              Well, you know, I just got to say again, when I first heard about your work, it made so much intuitive sense to me that you have sweat as a biofluid, from which we can learn a lot of things about someone's health. And it seems like you've just taken it further and further. It's fascinating to me. It seems to me that it'll just continue to grow.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Some OB-GYNs are pushing back against the federal government’s decision not to recommend the COVID shot for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a tragedy,” said Linda Eckert, MD, in an interview from UW Medicine. “It doesn’t follow the science or the data or the clinical experience we’ve had since COVID has been part of our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eckert said pregnant women develop more serious symptoms from COVID than women who are not pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They develop more hospitalizations; they have to be in the ICU more often,” she said. “They need the use of a ventilator more often. They even die more often.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UW doctor outlines importance of COVID vaccine recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eckert insists the vaccine not only reduces the risk of severe illness in pregnant mothers, it protects their newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If a pregnant woman develops an immunity to COVID, especially with a vaccine, and she has a high level of antibodies, she passes those on to the infant,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said data show that infants are much less likely to be hospitalized with COVID, within the first six months of life, if their mothers had been vaccinated while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she points out that there’s no approved COVID vaccine for babies, six months and younger, yet they face serious complications if infected. In fact, she said they have the same hospitalization rate as adults over the age of 65, yet COVID vaccines are still being recommended for that age group.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;p&gt;She worries the new government recommendations will discourage insurance companies from covering the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If insurance chooses not to cover this vaccine and people only have the option of paying out of pocket, we know that a lot of people aren’t going to be able to afford it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Junior said he would remove the CDC’s recommendation that children and healthy pregnant women get the COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has since said that children can get COVID shots if their parents first consult their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;

Made with a blend of eight functional mushrooms, including royal sun, lion’s mane, turkey tail, and others, they somehow avoid an earthy flavor. Actually, they’re raspberry-flavored. They’re vegan, non-GMO, and allergen-free. The mushrooms are grown in the United States, primarily in the Rocky Mountains, using regenerative practices. Plant People is a B Corp and Climate Neutral Certified company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Plant People, the effects (stress relief, better mood, consistent energy levels) build over the first month of consumption. I tried them for five days, which isn’t enough time to say if they “worked,” but it was enough to make me crave more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Across the board, Plant People’s functional mushroom gummies are easy to take, with no bitter aftertaste.

			&lt;p&gt;Not only can the drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; help to effectively manage type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="163568" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, it may also give older women a better chance of living to the grand old age of 90, according to new research – thanks, it seems, to a variety of anti-aging effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research used data from a long-term US study of postmenopausal women. Records on a total of 438 women were picked out – half who took metformin for their diabetes, and half who took a different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-confirms-experimental-drug-breaks-record-for-weight-loss-in-clinical-trials"&gt;diabetes drug&lt;/a&gt;, called sulfonylurea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are a lot of caveats and asterisks to the study, those in the metformin group were calculated to have a 30 percent lower risk of dying before the age of 90 than those in the sulfonylurea group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Metformin has been shown to target multiple pathways of aging and therefore has been postulated as a drug that may extend human longevity," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that metformin initiation increased exceptional longevity compared with sulfonylurea initiation among women with type 2 diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We already know quite a lot about metformin. It's been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-diabetes-drug-will-be-trialled-as-an-anti-ageing-elixir-from-next-year"&gt;around for decades&lt;/a&gt;, and is considered a gerotherapeutic: a drug able to slow down various aging processes in the body. For example, it's been shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.011"&gt;limit DNA damage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2022.101621"&gt;promote gene activity&lt;/a&gt; associated with long life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163572" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163572" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman.jpg" alt="Elderly woman" class="wp-image-163572 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman.jpg 2000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-738x415.jpg 738w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ElderlyWoman-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163572" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The study used 90 years old as the marker for 'exceptional' longevity. (&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/persons-hand-in-shallow-focus-CeZypKDceQc"&gt;Danie Franco/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown metformin can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-medication-slows-brain-aging-in-monkeys"&gt;put the brakes on&lt;/a&gt; wear and tear in the brain, and even reduce the risk &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheap-diabetes-drug-slashes-risk-of-long-covid-study-finds"&gt;of long COVID&lt;/a&gt;. However, scientists aren't yet sure that the drug extends lifespan, especially in humans – which is part of the reason for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research can't prove cause and effect like a randomized control trial (RCT) might be able to, because the participants weren't randomly assigned to one treatment or the other – rather, they were following professional advice. What's more, there was no &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo"&gt;placebo group&lt;/a&gt; given no treatment at all. The overall sample size wasn't particularly large, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study also has its strengths – not least the average 14 to 15 years of follow-up, which goes way beyond the length a standard RCT would be able to. That's important when you're trying to see how lifespan is affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A key advantage of our analysis was the long follow-up period after treatment initiation enabled by examination of a cohort with extensive follow-up from midlife to ages 90 and older, which is not feasible in typical randomized controlled trials," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaf095"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RCTs could be something that follows further down the line to dig deeper into these results, the researchers suggest.

Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, Kieran Moore, said that the infant faced other unrelated medical complications, but confirmed that measles may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have not had a measles outbreak in the community, of this size, for as long as I have practiced. Lots of doctors have never seen measles before now,” said Asmaa Hussain, a doctor who is head of paediatrics at the St Thomas Elgin general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hussain said that the true scale of the outbreak may be even larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There are likely lots and lots of children and families at home who had measles, who never presented to the hospital,” she said. “The tested cases do not capture even a fracture of what has happened in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c355fb29-e641-4f21-9f84-900189b30491" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A sign outside Southwestern Public Health in St Thomas, Ontario, on 4 March 2025.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Geoff Robins/Canadian Press via AP/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nearly 40% of cases in Ontario have been reported by the Southwestern Public Health Unit, which services Oxford county, Elgin county and the city of St Thomas, all about a two-hour drive south-west of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Shocking though the scale of the outbreak may seem, doctors on the frontline and scientists who study public health say that the return of measles was grimly predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A confluence of antiquated local public health vaccination strategies, sparse access to family doctors, delays in routine immunization due to Covid-19 and a surge in vaccine hesitancy propelled by online misinformation since the pandemic all have contributed to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;South-western Ontario is also home to populations of close-knit vaccine-hesitant religious communities who are less exposed to public health messaging, such as Mennonites. The current outbreak has been traced to a Mennonite wedding in New Brunswick, from which a guest returned to Ontario with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Meanwhile, case numbers have also been creeping up in the western province of Alberta, which this week reported a total of 710 confirmed cases, making it the worst year for measles since 1986, when 843 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is characterized by fever, cough, and a blotchy red, purple or brown widespread rash, and it can result in brain damage, blindness and death in severe cases. It is highly preventable through vaccination, however, and Canada’s goal is for 95% of the population to be immunized against the disease to prevent community spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the country has dropped below that as first-dose coverage for measles nationally fell from 2019 to 2023, from 90% to 83%, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In St Thomas, Hussain said that this year she has treated many babies younger than 12 months old with measles. Babies under a year are not eligible for the measles vaccine, and Hussain said that in many cases they are infected by unvaccinated older siblings who have picked up the virus from school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hussain also said she had treated an unvaccinated woman who caught the disease from her children before transmitting it to her newborn baby after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is illegal to send an unvaccinated child to school in Ontario unless they are immunized against various illnesses, including measles. But, exemptions are possible for valid medical reasons and when vaccination goes against personal religious belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Also, when unvaccinated families present with measles at healthcare centres, doctors sometimes struggle to even discuss vaccination with the parents, Hussain said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s really hard to even approach the conversation. I would ask: ‘How come you aren’t [vaccinated]?’ And they will say: ‘Oh, we’re exempt’ or ‘We’ve had this discussion before and we just don’t want to,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor at McMaster University in Ontario, said while distrust of vaccines has increased, Canada’s&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/06/canada-primary-healthcare-budget-cut-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; family doctor crisis&lt;/a&gt; also precipitated the measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 20% of Canadians have no family doctor at all, and many more have irregular access to clinicians, so parents do not have easy access to a trusted healthcare professional to discussion vaccinations. Furthermore, the lack of a national vaccine registry means that it can be challenging to know your own vaccination status, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bowdish also warned that vaccine exemptions were too easily obtained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“One of the challenges is that there’s been a loosening of exemptions as well, so people may not have that faith-based reason, or a reason that’s actually supported by their religion, but just a general sense that they don’t get their kids vaccinated. It’s really hard to balance personal freedoms with public health,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It’s really hard to balance personal freedoms with public health&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dawn Bowdish, McMaster University&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Ontario’s Ministry of Health did not respond to a query about vaccine exemptions and strategies to reach religious minority communities. The Southwestern Public Health Unit referred queries to Public Health Ontario, who in turn referred the question to the Southwestern Public Health Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Various vaccine clinics have been launched across south-western Ontario to ramp up the measles immunization status in the region, though they have not been held at schools. The Ontario government has previously said its teams are on the ground with local public health units, but that convincing vaccine-hesitant people is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kumanan Wilson, a doctor and professor at the University of Ottawa who studies public health policy, said the Covid pandemic heightened anxieties about perceived government overreach – and simultaneously resulted in many people losing direct, frequent access to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, he said, focusing on religious communities in the current outbreak could obscure broader concerns that previous methods used by public health agencies to manage illness have lost efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="37af9f54-2a38-4bde-ba34-b48e293f5a05" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"World may be ‘post-herd immunity’ to measles, top US scientist says","elementId":"37af9f54-2a38-4bde-ba34-b48e293f5a05","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/measles-post-herd-immunity"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They’re going to have to learn to navigate this new world of people not trusting government as much and more populist tendencies. And that’s going to take an adjustment in how we communicate,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Twenty years ago, Wilson carried out &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15811647/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that found providing accurate public health information actually increased mistrust among the vaccine-hesitant, who said they found it “manipulative”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You need to find champions within those communities, who believe in what the public health people are telling them, and can communicate that message,” he said. He said Canadian public health has previously focused on shaming those who do not vaccinate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“And in this era, that doesn’t work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A study by the Angus Reid Institute published at the end of May found that a quarter of Canadians overall do not trust their provincial governments to respond to the measles outbreak adequately. That number was higher in Ontario, at 27%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That study also found that one in five Canadians with children under 18 are hesitant to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hussain fears that other previously dormant illnesses may return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles, when mild, can be managed by physicians like herself.

A founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., Dr. Topol is also the author of a New York Times bestselling new &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Super-Agers/Eric-Topol/9781668067666" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;book&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Super Agers: An Evidence Based Approach to Longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently sat down with Topol to discuss his book’s insights into slowing down, or turning back, our aging clocks to become more like super agers — or who he calls the “Wellderly” — people who live well into their 80s and 90s without any chronic illness or disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive answer to that question requires reading his book, written for a lay audience curious about the latest (and upcoming) scientific breakthroughs in longevity medicine. But in our hour-long conversation, Topol discussed several do’s and don’ts for anyone seeking to make 80 the new 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-do-strengthen-your-immune-system" class="subhead"&gt;1. Do: Strengthen your immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is one main thesis to Topol’s book, it’s that healthy aging is a function of a strong immune system, which can defend against diabetes, cancer, heart disease and other chronic conditions. “I keep saying to myself that old thing about the economy: ‘It’s the immune system, stupid,’ you know?” Topol told me. “Because it really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggests focusing on habits that support and build immune health:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular strength and resistance training builds strong immune systems and is the single best way to extend lifespan and, importantly, health span.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep a Mediterranean-style diet that maximizes whole foods, colorful vegetables, lean meats, olive oil and minimal dairy, and minimizes ultra-processed food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get deep, restorative sleep — crucial for supporting your body’s immune function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain so-called “lifestyle+” factors, like spending time in nature, avoiding environmental pollution like food-borne plastics and airborne toxins, and maintaining strong friendships and a regular social calendar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll go deeper into some of these specific strategies, like sleep and nutrition, below. But the common denominator is supporting a robust immune function, Topol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should be having immune system testing as we get older,” he said, “because it is the reason why aging can hurt us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-dont-limit-your-medical-care-to-only-what-your-insurance-covers" class="subhead"&gt;2. Don’t: Limit your medical care to only what your insurance covers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most employer-provided health insurance programs cover only the minimum annual tests to gauge basic heart health and disease risks, cholesterol level and hormone health. “Standard medicine is missing out, leaving too many unsolved questions about a person’s risk,” Topol said. “Just do the tests based on a person’s risk; the yield is much higher.“ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recommends a few lower-cost, specific tests to help personalize medical care and guide preventive strategies that can help flag potential disease risks that most insurance-covered tests do not:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS): Often costing fewer than $50, these tests provide validated risk estimates for common cancers (e.g., prostate, breast, lung, colorectal, melanoma) and other diseases. Use this test alongside other health data, like family history and routine blood tests, to provide a more comprehensive risk assessment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DEXA scans: Typically costing less than $100, this is a relatively inexpensive and useful tool for monitoring changes in body composition, such as muscle and fat mass, or older adults concerned about muscle loss. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sequencing your genome: For about $200, this process can help determine which, if any, cancers you may be most predisposed to. This is a test you need to take only once, for lifelong knowledge. Caveat: Unfortunately, most of the validated datasets for genomic cancer risk are still for people of European ancestry only.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-do-nourish-your-gut-brain-axis" class="subhead"&gt;3. Do: Nourish your “gut-brain axis”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “Super Agers,” Topol writes at length about the bidirectional communication between gut hormones and the brain, and calls it critical to healthy immune function. Gut hormones are chemical messengers made by special cells in the digestive tract that help control digestive functions. They communicate with the brain through the bloodstream and the vagus nerve, which runs through the throat and vocal cords and connects the gut and brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m pretty well-convinced now that the gut hormone story is the most extraordinary thing I’ve ever seen in medical intervention,” he told me. “Because the gut hormones talk to the immune system, and they talk to the brain, which is mission control for the immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It isn’t just the microbiome, it’s the gut’s hormone production,” he said. “The way to a person’s brain and to healthy aging, it likely will be through their gut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to nourish the two-way communication along the so-called gut-brain axis:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a strong and diverse gut microbiome: Consume a variety of whole foods (meat, grains, legumes, dark leafy greens), and minimize ultra-processed foods (i.e., anything with a long list of ingredients you can’t pronounce). Foods with active macrobiotic cultures like yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha are great for building healthy, diverse gut bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stimulate and strengthen your vagus nerve. Care for it via deep-breathing exercises that engage the diaphragm. Singing, humming, laughing and even gargling stimulate the vagus nerve, and cold-water exposure can activate it and enhance its tone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="4-dont-sleep-too-little-or-too-much" class="subhead"&gt;4. Don’t: Sleep too little — or too much&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know that getting enough sleep is critical to health and specifically to healthy aging, and many doctors rightfully call Americans’ chronic lack of proper sleep a public health crisis. But there’s another side to the sleep story, Topol said, admitting his own surprise: According to plenty of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00210-2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clinical research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for people in their late 30s and older, getting more than seven to eight hours of sleep was associated with greater mortality risks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The principal finding was that about seven hours is the optimal duration of sleep,” he writes in his book. “Every one-hour-a-night increase in sleep duration above that seven- to eight-hour threshold is associated with 12%  higher risk of total cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve sleep function, Topol recommends maintaining a consistent bedtime and waking schedule, and avoiding eating or drinking alcohol for a few hours before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-do-use-ai-to-answer-health-aging-questions-but-with-caution" class="subhead"&gt;5. Do: Use AI to answer health aging questions — but with caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The convergence of AI with advances in biomedical data — such as genomics, microbiome analysis and digital health monitoring — create a transformative force that can radically improve disease prediction, prevention and personalized care, Topol told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, AI is a powerful tool, he said, that can still be grossly mistaken, sometimes. So with caution and vigilance for AI “hallucinations” that provide flat-out wrong information, here’s how you can use it to help you age with strength:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage personal health data: Consider feeding consumer AI apps like Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google) and Perplexity your anonymized data from wearable devices, mobile health apps and at-home testing kits for real-time feedback and personalized recommendations. Maintaining proper digital privacy means scrubbing personally identifying information like your name, address and social security number from any documents you upload to AI platforms. (Assume personally identifying data you provide an AI system may be captured by the company that owns it.) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make AI your personal food and beverage analyst: The more specific you can get about which foods you consume and how much, the more AI can give you an accurate idea of how balanced your diet is compared to nutritional standards. I’ve done this and received eye-opening feedback. Always ask the AI system what nutrition standards it’s using, and don’t be afraid to challenge results that don’t sound right. (Some AI can be good at admitting when it’s wrong.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask AI for non-technical explanations of emerging longevity trends, treatments and scientific breakthroughs. For instance, ask Perplexity, “Why are doctors so excited about GLP-1s now?” What it replies may well surprise you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxOODVCb2JFaF96T2gxZ2g4d2FLRUthSU40eTJTQzlHa0dfSldLR2NmRlIybWF2b1kzWmxMNHJwQTE3YXFoYWhqUXA0MkNiamFUWlRlYk9nenY0VlBkbmU5N3ExZTZTN0pwUU1WejdibU83b1lMMFZ0Z004Vk1yakN1dDd6Vnd3MG4tc3JEYkw0cmN3YU5Gcjd2UlRVQ0NEb0ptR1Rpd0l0cl9WT2JFZkdzNkhHTEoyT3JZTWFackFrWWRDcEhZ</guid></item><item><title>一位女士在开放体验时分享了Wegovy使用前后的令人难以置信的图像- LADbible | Woman shared incredible before and after images of Wegovy use as she opened up about experience - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNaHEzdmYxbVRkVTZRM2UwRnNiUmlzdU04eUtHVVlVci1PWE92Vmk1VDA5bUY4VGNidmRHZ09DSjB6SG9ybXRiUUN6VjQwTWRsOERKc2tKUXVudnU0WmpHT3RrbnFoWWtoczlpQjQzd3JMN1BSc2ItZGZBZGNKMnJNUU4yWDl4RExfeHV2Nnh5MC0yaXZRRVhtRTlnRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A US woman revealed the incredible results after using semaglutide injections to help with her weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The words '&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;', '&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/mounjaro"&gt;Mounjaro&lt;/a&gt;' and 'Wegovy' are strong contenders for being the most searched word of the year after a global boom in people using the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;medication&lt;/a&gt; for weight-loss reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Originally created as a method to aid in the management of type two diabetes, the drug family works by mimicking a hormone called GLP-1, which regulates the body's blood sugar and appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As the hormone levels rise in your brain it tricks the body into being full, alongside reducing the amount of glucose produced in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Which means not only are GLP-1 (Ozempic, Wegovy) and GLP-1 and GIP (Mounjaro) good for controlling diabetes, but they also help with weight management, although it's important to note that Ozempic has not been FDA approved for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And it seems like everyone from &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;A-listers&lt;/a&gt;

Her doctors put it down to a rare disorder she had that caused her lungs to become chronically inflamed. "No worry, it must be that," she was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;When she finally had an X-ray, a shadow was detected on her lung. "That set the ball rolling," Martha recalls. "First, a CT scan was done, then a bronchoscopy [a procedure that involves using a long tube to inspect the airways in a person's lungs] to take tissue samples." After the tumour was removed, about four months after she'd first reported symptoms to her GP, she received the diagnosis: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/lung-cancer/stages-types-grades/stage-3" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Stage IIIA lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The tumour had infiltrated the surrounding lymph nodes but had not yet spread to distant organs. Martha was 59 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was a total shock," says Martha. Although she would occasionally light up a cigarette at a party, she never considered herself a smoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/lung-cancer-statistics/#:~:text=Lung%20cancer%20is%20the%20most,most%20common%20cancer%20in%20women." class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most common cancer worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lung-cancer" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;leading cause of cancer death&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gco.iarc.who.int/media/globocan/factsheets/populations/900-world-fact-sheet.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In 2022&lt;/a&gt;, about 2.5 million people were diagnosed with the disease and more than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gco.iarc.fr/today/en/dataviz/pie?mode=population&amp;amp;group_populations=0&amp;amp;cancers=15&amp;amp;types=1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;1.8 million&lt;/a&gt; died. Although tobacco-related lung cancers still account for the majority of diagnoses worldwide, smoking rates have been &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/16-01-2024-tobacco-use-declines-despite-tobacco-industry-efforts-to-jeopardize-progress" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;declining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833289" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;for several decades&lt;/a&gt;. As the number of smokers continues to fall in many countries around the world, the proportion of lung cancer occurring in people who have never smoked is on the rise. Between &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/lung-cancer-never-smokers" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;10 and 20%&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer diagnoses are now made in individuals who have never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Lung cancer in never-smokers is emerging as a separate disease entity with distinct molecular characteristics that directly impact treatment decisions and outcomes," says Andreas Wicki, an oncologist at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. While the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38195910/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;average age at diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is similar to that of smoking-related lung cancers, younger patients with lung cancer are more likely to have never smoked. "When we see 30- or 35-year-olds with lung cancer, they are usually never-smokers," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another difference is the type of cancer being diagnosed. Until the 1950s and 1960s, the most common form of lung cancer was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8639747" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; – a type which begins with the cells that line the lungs. In contrast, lung cancer in never-smokers is almost exclusively &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519578/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;adenocarcinoma&lt;/a&gt; – a type which starts in mucus-producing cells – which is now the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00428-4/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most common form&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer in both smokers and never-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Like other forms of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. "If there's a 1cm (0.4in) tumour hidden somewhere in your lungs, you won't notice it," says Wicki. The early symptoms, which include persistent coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath or wheezing, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4375-lung-cancer" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;often only appear&lt;/a&gt; when the tumour is larger or has spread. In addition, the historically strong link between smoking and lung cancer may inadvertently lead non-smokers to attribute symptoms to other causes, says Wicki. "Most cases in never-smokers are therefore only diagnosed at stage 3 or 4."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The smoke from cooking fuel and fumes from cooking oil can increase a person's risk of lung disease, including lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The smoke from cooking fuel and fumes from cooking oil can increase a person's risk of lung disease, including lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer in never-smokers is also more common in women. Women who have never smoked are more than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://go2.org/wp-content/uploads/GO2-WLC-Facts-0823.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop lung cancer as male never-smokers. Aside from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/why-is-there-an-increase-in-lung-cancer-among-women-who-have-never-smoked-249406" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lung anatomy and environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt;, at least part of the answer may lie in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00175-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; that are more common in women, especially in Asian women. One of the most prevalent is a mutation known as EGFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer cells in people who have never smoked usually have a number of mutations that could be causing their cancer, explains Wicki – so-called driver mutations. These &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/symptoms-diagnosis/biomarker-testing/egfr" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;genetic changes drive tumour growth&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1568026620666200303123102" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;EGFR&lt;/a&gt; gene which codes for a protein on the surface of cells and is called epidermal growth factor receptor. The reasons why these driver mutations are more frequently found in female patients, particularly those of Asian descent, are not entirely understood. There is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3391698/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8524770/#sec12-15353702211019697" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;female hormones&lt;/a&gt; may play a role, with certain genetic variants that affect oestrogen metabolism being more prevalent in East Asians. This could potentially explain the higher incidence of EGFR-mutant lung cancer in Asian women, although the data is very preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Following the discovery of mutations which can lead to lung cancer in non-smokers, the pharmaceutical industry began to develop drugs that specifically block the activity of those proteins. For example, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://scholarworks.indianapolis.iu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/46cb7e85-0b8b-46d3-b5b2-fecd68c8b3e1/content" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;first EGFR inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; became available around 20 years ago and most patients showed an impressive response. However, treatment often led to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2670612/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;resistant cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in tumour relapse. In recent years, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-024-00971-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;much effort&lt;/a&gt; has been put into overcoming this problem, with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39366135/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;newer types of drugs&lt;/a&gt; now entering the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a result, the prognosis for patients has steadily improved. "The median survival rate of patients who carry such driver mutations is now several years," Wicki explains. "We have patients who have been on targeted therapy for more than 10 years. This is a huge step forward when you consider that the median survival rate was less than 12 months about 20 years ago." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As the proportion of lung cancer in never-smokers increases, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44276-023-00006-w" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;experts say&lt;/a&gt; it is crucial to develop prevention strategies for this population. A number of risk factors have been implicated. For example, studies have revealed that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9264880/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;radon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4126868/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;second-hand smoke&lt;/a&gt; can elevate the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers. Additionally, exposure to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4232458/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cooking fumes&lt;/a&gt; or to stoves burning wood or coal in poorly ventilated rooms may also increase this risk. Since women traditionally spend more time indoors, they are particularly vulnerable to this type of indoor air pollution. However, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7904962/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;outdoor air pollution&lt;/a&gt; is an even more significant factor in the development of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Particulate air pollution can increase a person's risk of developing lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Particulate air pollution can increase a person's risk of developing lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In fact, outdoor air pollution is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2023.05.024" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;second leading cause of all lung cancer cases&lt;/a&gt; after smoking. Studies have revealed that people who &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-025-02999-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;live in highly polluted areas&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to die of lung cancer than those who do not. Particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (about a 30th of the width of a human hair), typically found in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10543654/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vehicle exhaust&lt;/a&gt; and fossil fuel smoke, seems to play an important role. And intriguingly,  &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.esmo.org/press-releases/scientists-discover-how-air-pollution-may-trigger-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt; a strong link between high levels of PM2.5 and lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked and who carry an EGFR mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;At least one study has shown an association between wildfire exposure and increased incidence of lung cancer – Christine Berg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;How air pollution may trigger lung cancer in never-smokers carrying the EGFR mutation has been the focus of research at the Francis Crick Institute in London. "When we think about environmental carcinogens, we usually think about them as causing mutations in the DNA", says William Hill, a post-doctoral researcher in the cancer evolution and genome instability laboratory of the Francis Crick Institute. Cigarette smoke, for example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6546629/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;damages our DNA&lt;/a&gt;, thus leading to lung cancer. "However, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020004/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;our [2023] study&lt;/a&gt; proposes that PM2.5 doesn't directly mutate DNA, rather it wakes up dormant mutant cells sitting in our lungs and starts them on the early stages of lung cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In their experiments, the researchers showed that air pollutants are taken up by immune cells called macrophages. These cells normally protect the lung by ingesting infectious organisms. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10213952/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In response to PM2.5 exposure&lt;/a&gt;, macrophages release chemical messengers known as cytokines, which wake up cells carrying the EGFR mutation and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00175-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;causes them to proliferate&lt;/a&gt;. "Both air pollution and EGFR mutations are needed for tumours to grow," says Hill. Understanding how PM2.5 acts on the microenvironment of cells carrying EGFR mutations to promote tumour growth, he adds, could pave the way for new approaches to preventing lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The association between air pollution and lung cancer is not new. In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/2/4682/739" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;landmark paper&lt;/a&gt; establishing the link between smoking and lung cancer in 1950, the authors suggested outdoor pollutants from the burning of fossil fuels as a possible cause. But policies to date have focused almost exclusively on tobacco control. But 75 years later, air pollution is finally coming into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;…99% of the world population lives in areas where air pollution levels exceed WHO guideline limits – Ganfeng Luo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Air pollution levels &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://phys.org/news/2024-03-air-quality-europe-significant-decades.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43492-9" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; have fallen in recent decades. But the effect of changes on lung cancer rates has not yet become apparent. "It probably takes 15 to 20 years for changes in exposure to be reflected in lung cancer rates, but we don't know for sure," says Christine Berg, a retired oncologist from the National Cancer Institute in Maryland, US. Moreover, the picture is not static: climate change is likely to have an impact in the future. "With the increasing risk of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21708-0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, air pollution and PM2.5 levels are rising again in certain regions of the US," says Berg. "At least &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519622000675" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown an association between wildfire exposure and increased incidence of lung cancer. Transitioning away from coal, oil and gas is therefore crucial not only to slow global warming but also to improve air quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 2021, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;WHO halved&lt;/a&gt; the annual mean air quality guideline for PM2.5, meaning it has adopted a more stringent approach to particulate matter. "But 99% of the world population lives in areas where air pollution levels exceed [these updated] WHO guideline limits," says Ganfeng Luo, a postdoctoral researcher at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00428-4/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, IARC researchers estimated that approximately 194,000 cases of lung adenocarcinoma worldwide were attributable to PM2.5 in 2022.

In Delhi, the average &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://education.iaslc.org/URL/AirPollutionWebinar" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;PM2.5 levels&lt;/a&gt; are above 100 micrograms per sq m, which is 20 times above the WHO air quality guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the UK, 1,100 people developed adenocarcinoma of the lung as a result of air pollution in 2022, the IARC study found. "But not all of these cases will be in never-smokers," says Harriet Rumgay, an epidemiologist and a co-author of the study. Adenocarcinoma also occurs in smokers, especially in those using filtered cigarettes. "There's still a lot we don't know," says Rumgay. "More research is needed to disentangle the different factors and also to understand, for example, how long you would need to be exposed to air pollution before developing lung cancer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As treatments continue to improve, lung cancer in never-smokers is becoming more survivable. It is conceivable that this type of lung cancer will one day become the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11014425/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most common form&lt;/a&gt; of a disease that has historically been associated with older male smokers, changing the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44276-023-00006-w" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;way we think about the disease&lt;/a&gt; in popular culture; "…the idea that they [patients] are at least partly to blame for their disease is unfortunately still widespread," says Wicki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Martha was found to have an EGFR mutation and has been taking an inhibitor since her diagnosis almost three years ago.

Balancing the risks and benefits of drug treatment and maintaining a reasonable quality of life is not always easy, she says.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;While exercising and eating well is not only important for staying healthy, research shows it may also give you an upper hand in the fight against cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cancer.ca/en/about-us/media-releases/2025/exercise-improves-survival-for-colon-cancer"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; funded by the Canadian Cancer Society followed people who were prescribed a 3-year exercise program after treatment for colorectal cancer. It found that those who received the program had both a 28% lower risk of recurrence of the disease and new cancer — plus, a 37% lower risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Bires, a specialist in psychological oncology and executive director of the Peterson Life with Cancer program at Inova’s Schar Cancer Institute, said studies on other forms of cancer, such as melanoma, are also showing the importance of diet and exercise during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Incorporating a healthy lifestyle before you get cancer, during treatment or even into survivorship, can be a really key component of increasing quality of life, longevity and feeling better,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said both exercise and nutrition have been shown to help with fatigue, quality of life, and adhering to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bires noted that the field has shifted, as more cancer doctors include diet and exercise to patient treatment plans. According to Bires, one issue — historically — is research money not being available for studies on the effects of nutrition and working out following cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think what’s complicated is that food is not a drug company, and so oftentimes there’s not a lot of funding for research in these areas, but definitely people are becoming more and more interested, and we’re seeing more and more data come out on the impact of a healthy diet and nutrition and how it can impact prevention as well as treatment,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to exercise, Bires recommends those battling cancer should keep moving as much as they can during treatment, and that they get back to it as fast as they can after completing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether it’s doing walking, gentle weight lifting, yoga and stretching, moving our bodies is really important for a number of reasons,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bires added that more data is showing inflammatory foods and foods with additives don’t help those fighting cancer, but that whole foods — including vegetables, fruits and whole grains — do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do imagine that we’re going to see more and more studies coming out that show how nutrition and the gut microbiome impacts treatment and really quality of life while receiving treatment into survivorship,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important way to help yourself during a cancer battle is by lowering stress levels, Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said when it comes to starting an exercise and diet routine, whether it be during cancer treatment or to prevent cancer, it’s okay to start out small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe start with going on a walk each day or replacing one unprocessed food with a vegetable or fruit, and also creating some accountability. Anytime that we can exercise with friends or share recipes and really creating some accountability, that can be helpful for some of these habits,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bires said there isn’t one strategy for getting started that works for everyone, but instead the goal is to begin “creating habits.” Also, don’t let missed days derail your plan entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re all going to miss days or have missteps, but we want to make sure that we’re doing these things the majority of the time,” Bires said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-after-5-pm-for-healthy-aging-11712308" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, supporting your gut microbiome is a crucial piece of the puzzle. In fact, growing research suggests that a healthy, diverse microbiome may be an important predictor of longevity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  While the gut microbiome is surprisingly adaptable, some common day-to-day habits can collectively take a toll on your gut, causing it to age faster. Read on to find out what habits experts say may be aging your gut—and what to do instead. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-eating-the-same-things-all-the-time"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Eating the Same Things All the Time &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diverse microbiome&lt;/a&gt;—aka a variety of beneficial gut microorganisms—is essential for a healthy gut. And one of the best ways to achieve this is by eating a varied diet filled with minimally processed, whole foods, especially &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based ones&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests that including five different servings of plants on your plate each day may improve your long-term health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A variety of fiber foods means that you’ll also benefit from getting a wide variety of nutrients,” says &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Amanda Sauceda MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lack of variety may also be a factor in why the Standard American Diet (SAD) is linked with poor gut health outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Not only is SAD typically low in fiber, but it tends to be high in processed foods, which aren’t as nutrient-rich as their whole-food counterparts. “Inevitably this pattern of eating, over time, has been shown to alter the gut microbiome (complex ecosystem of microbes in our gut), in ways that can lead to inflammation,” explains &lt;a href="https://wholeisticliving.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jenna Volpe RDN, LD, CLT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This unchecked inflammation can age your gut and increase your risk of chronic disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Grazing Rather Than Eating Meals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some individuals get into the habit of grazing through the day rather than eating meals. This frequent snacking and even late-night eating can age the gut. Our gut needs periods of rest to clean and repair itself” says &lt;a href="https://www.oswalddigestiveclinic.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcie Vaske MS LN CNS&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically, we need to give our body the chance for the migrating motor complex (MMC) to turn on between meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The MMC is essentially like a motorized intestinal broom, creating a downward wave-like motion responsible for sweeping the debris (such as microbes) down and out of our small intestine. A full cycle of MMC activity takes about 4 to 5 hours,” explains Volpe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frequent grazing, or even consuming sweetened beverages throughout the day, turns off the MMC, so it doesn't get a chance to effectively sweep out the intestines. Over time, this spells trouble since it may increase the risk of developing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), bloating and more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Per Volpe, allowing 3–4 hours between each meal or snack (and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drink-to-limit-to-live-longer-11708703" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avoiding sugary beverages&lt;/a&gt;) is optimal for healthy gut motility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-chronic-stress"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Chronic Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Has stress ever &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292287/6-ways-stress-can-mess-with-your-digestion/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;presented itself in digestive woes&lt;/a&gt;? It’s not just a coincidence. “Stress isn’t just in your head, your gut feels it too,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbyjulie.net/meetjulie" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Julie Balsamo MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, stress can age your gut in more ways than one.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Stress can impact gut motility and hypersensitivity (through the brain-gut axis). It can also disrupt the intestinal epithelial barrier function and trigger immune responses of the gut. Finally, it can alter the gut microbiome and cause dysbiosis. All of these changes can increase the risk and severity of both functional and inflammatory GI disorders and in turn age the gut,” explains &lt;a href="https://gastrohealth.com/physicians/asma-p-khapra-md" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Asma Khapra&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That being said, stress is unavoidable, so it’s important to adopt habits to keep stress in check for the sake of your long term health. The good news is that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress-relieving practices &lt;/a&gt;don’t have to take more than 10 minutes of your day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-not-eating-enough-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Not Eating Enough Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re familiar with gut health, then you’re likely not surprised to see fiber on this list. “[Eating more fiber] is the most basic thing we can do for our gut, but with 90% of people not meeting fiber recommendations it’s the one area that almost everyone can improve on” says Sauceda. Your gut &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/283531/top-fiber-rich-foods-for-good-gut-bacteria/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;needs dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; to perform at its best.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Without enough fiber, your good gut bacteria don’t have the fuel they need to thrive, and the protective mucus lining in your gut can start to break down. That leaves your digestive system more vulnerable to inflammation, irritation, and early decline,” explains &lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Simpson RDN, CGN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tummy troubles happen, but if they’re persistent, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-you-should-see-a-gastroenterologist-11715186" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;it’s time to visit a gut health professional&lt;/a&gt;. “If you experience gut issues and make the decision to ignore them…you may be aging your gut. Gas, bloating, reflux, diarrhea and constipation are not ‘normal.’ When left untreated, these symptoms can signal deeper issues like dysbiosis, leaky gut or even enzyme deficiencies. Over time, all of them can worsen and age your gut if not addressed,” says Vaske. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-forgetting-about-fermented-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Forgetting About Fermented Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fermented foods have a few special qualities for your gut that help it from aging,” says Sauceda. She adds, “One of the unique benefits of fermented foods is that they can have increased digestibility and nutrient bioavailability.” &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; like yogurt, kombucha and kimchi are also a source of probiotics.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  “It’s thought that the bacteria found in fermented foods could help with maintaining your gut barrier and with inflammation,” explains Sauceda. Make it a habit to stock your fridge with fermented foods and add them to your meals regularly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-overuse-of-medications"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Overuse of Medications &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Antibiotics can be lifesaving, but overusing them, especially for things that might not need them, can do real damage to your gut. They don’t just kill the bad bacteria; they wipe out the good ones too, leaving your microbiome depleted and more prone to inflammation and imbalance,” says Simpson. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to antibiotics, several over-the-counter medications may also prematurely age your gut with long-term use. “Medications like ibuprofen or acid blockers can offer short-term relief. However, long-term use can worsen digestive symptoms by irritating the gut lining, lowering stomach acid (which you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for proper digestion) and disrupting microbiome balance,” explains Balsamo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-not-prioritizing-physical-activity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 8. Not Prioritizing Physical Activity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we normally associate exercise with heart health, it can also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8017087/things-you-should-do-every-day-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support gut health&lt;/a&gt; in more ways than one. Exercise not only strengthens the muscles in your abs, arms and legs—your gut muscles benefit, too. Stronger gut muscles means your gut can move waste faster and more efficiently. On the flip side, when you are less physically active, so are your gut muscles. Exercise may also have positive effects on your gut microbiome. Research shows that folks who regularly exercise tend to have a better balance of good microbes in their gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-9-drinking-too-much-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 9. Drinking Too Much Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grabbing an occasional drink with a friend to unwind after a long week is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on your gut health. However, excess alcohol intake can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960653/ways-drinking-alcohol-affects-your-bowel-movements-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;have more serious consequences&lt;/a&gt;, causing your gut to age faster. This is because alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-inflammation-8415778" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;increases chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the gut. When alcohol is broken down, it releases toxins that may damage the intestinal lining, weakening its defenses against pathogens and contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-leaky-gut-syndrome-8421526" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;“leaky” gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Alcohol can also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8070932/drinking-alcohol-effect-on-gut-microbiome-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;change the composition of your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; tipping the scales in favor of more “bad” bacteria. That said, be mindful of how much and how often you consume alcohol as it impacts not just gut health but your risk of other diseases as well.

Skipping Out on Adequate Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you regularly clocking the recommended 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night? If not, it may be time to reassess your sleep habits. Your gut is also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877347/your-gut-health-could-affect-how-well-you-sleep-according-to-new-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;closely connected with your sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; via the gut-brain axis. In fact, research suggests that sleep and your gut health are a two way street.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A more diverse microbiome supports better sleep while poor sleep can disrupt the health of your microbiome. So if you’re regularly missing out on adequate shut eye, that could be aging your gut. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you treat your gut well, it will return the favor. While not meeting your fiber needs or skipping out on sleep is OK on occasion, it can be hard for your gut to keep up when they become regular occurrences. Over the course of years, the damage caused by one or more of the habits highlighted above can start to age your gut prematurely. The good news? It’s never too late to start ditching these common habits for healthier ones to turn back the clock on your gut health.&lt;br&gt;

He begins with the concept of the aerobiome–the collection of living things from ground level to the stratosphere. While that includes eagles and dragonflies, the most insidious inhabitants are those we can’t see. Often, we are totally unaware of their presence. Yet bacteria like the one that causes tuberculosis or viruses like those that cause COVID or flu have the power to make us ill even if we don’t know they are there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could listen through your local public radio station or get the live stream on Saturday, June 7, 2025, at 7 am EDT on your computer or smart phone (&lt;a href="https://www.wunc.org"&gt;wunc.org&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/find-a-radio-station"&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt; so you can find which stations carry our broadcast.

Lately, scientists have learned that humans have a microbiome for every different part of our bodies, including our eyes, ears, mouth and lungs. The air around us is also full of microorganisms. And even though we can’t see them and we may not be able to smell or taste them, they can still have a big impact on our health. What are the hidden dangers in the air we breathe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Florence Nightingale and the Science of Ventilation:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the mid-19th century, Florence Nightingale insisted that fresh air and sunlight were essential for patients to recover. Even though she didn’t know the scientific reason for this, her observation was correct. Good ventilation can help lessen the risk of disease transmission. But infectious disease specialists were not paying much attention to air quality until COVID-19 came along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the pandemic, health experts actually resisted the idea that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, could be airborne. Public health authorities stressed the importance of hand washing, social distancing and disinfecting doorknobs, groceries or other items that someone else might have touched. Those turned out to be of much less significance than the dangers in the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Skagit Valley Chorale Superspreader Event:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2020, the Skagit Valley Chorale got together to rehearse for an upcoming concert. There were about 60 singers who took the advised precautions: social distancing and hand sanitizing. The room in which they rehearsed was poorly ventilated, and no one was wearing a mask. This was at a time when the CDC was urging Americans NOT to wear masks, for fear there wouldn’t be enough for healthcare workers. Within a few days, six of the singers were sick. Eventually, 52 of them came down with COVID from this single exposure. Two women died. The Skagit Valley Chorale provided an irrefutable example that the virus could be airborne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Have We Learned the Lessons of COVID-19?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we learned the lessons we should take from the pandemic, we will be on the lookout for other hidden dangers in the air we breathe. We know that measles is incredibly transmissible and that the measles virus is airborne. In areas where measles is spreading, people would be smart to wear effective masks, such as N95, in public. Unfortunately, masks have been politicized, although viruses do not care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pathogen that spreads through the air is tuberculosis. Americans don’t think of this as an important problem, but drug-resistant TB is a world-wide threat. Approximately one-fourth of humans carry this pathogen. It can become active whenever stress or other problems knock the immune system down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many other countries responded differently to the pandemic. Perhaps some will improve the ventilation and filtration in public spaces. That is unlikely in most parts of the US, due to cost. Perhaps we should take to carrying carbon dioxide monitors wherever we go. That will not tell us if there are hidden dangers in the air, but it will indicate how many people have been breathing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;This Week’s Guest:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Zimmer writes the “Origins” column for the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and has frequently contributed to the &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;.

			&lt;p&gt;The number of people being diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ASD)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ADHD)&lt;/span&gt; has risen sharply in recent decades, and research continues to look at factors involved in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in 2023 revealed there's a difference in how children with &lt;span&gt;autism&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; clear the common plastic compound bisphenol A (BPA), compared to neurotypical children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA is used in a lot of plastics and plastic production processes, and can also be found inside food and drink cans. However, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hormone-disrupting-chemical-detected-in-90-of-europeans-research-shows"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has also linked it to health issues involving hormone disruption, including breast  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="163645" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150231" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150231" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642.jpg" alt="plastic water bottles" class="wp-image-150231 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150231" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plastic bottles can contain the additive bisphenol A. (&lt;a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/bottles-plastic-recycling-4276208/"&gt;fotoblend/pixabay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Rowan University and Rutgers University in the US looked at three groups of children: 66 with &lt;span&gt;autism&lt;/span&gt;, 46 with &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;, and 37 neurotypical kids. In particular, they analyzed the process of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronidation"&gt;glucuronidation&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical process the body uses to clear out toxins within the blood through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that kids with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; couldn't clear out BPA and another similar compound called &lt;a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/1750368/"&gt;diethylhexyl phthalate&lt;/a&gt; (DEHP) with as much efficiency as other kids, potentially leading to longer exposure to their toxic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Detoxification of these two plasticizers is compromised in children with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. "Consequently, their tissues are more exposed to these two plasticizers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only in the case of BPA that the difference was  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="163645" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; though: the efficiency was reduced by about 11 percent for kids with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and 17 percent for kids with &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;, compared with the control group of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think that gene mutations in certain individuals mean that BPA can't be cleared as well as it needs to be, which means the substance sticks around in the body. That potentially could cause damage in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-brain-reveals-the-genetic-origins-of-autism-spectrum-disorder"&gt;neuron development&lt;/a&gt; and operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150233" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642.jpg" alt="neuron image" class="wp-image-150233 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150233" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Inability to clear BPA in some individuals could affect the development of their neurons.

However, it's only part of the story – not every child with a neurodevelopmental disorder had problems flushing out BPA, so there are other factors at play, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is continuing to identify how exactly &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-presents-in-different-forms-which-scientists-still-can-t-fully-explain"&gt;develop in people&lt;/a&gt; – whether it's in utero before birth for example, or later on in life – as the data isn't enough to show whether BPA exposure causes either disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an extensive body of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33004-1/fulltext"&gt;epidemiological evidence&lt;/a&gt; for a relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and environmental pollutants such as plasticizers," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the researchers &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How important plasticizer originated neurodevelopmental disorder is in the overall occurrence of these disorders is not known, but it must account for a significant proportion or would not have been so easy to detect in a metabolic study of moderate size such as this study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in October 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taurine — an amino acid found in some foods and also made by the human body — has been shown to slow aging in animals when given as a supplement, raising the idea that it might be a promising anti-aging treatment for people. But now, a new study has raised questions about taurine's relationship to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Thursday (June 5) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2116?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D23093234137653293603044630514166490186%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1749142451" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2116?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D23093234137653293603044630514166490186%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1749142451" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, measured taurine in the blood of three groups of people across adulthood, as well as in the blood of adult monkeys and mice. Some previous studies found that circulating taurine declines with age, which could help explain why taurine supplements improve certain signs of aging while extending lifespan — at least in lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those previous studies had limitations, though. For example, most were "cross-sectional" — meaning rather than tracking the same organisms through time, they looked at many, different-aged organisms at one point in time. This approach has produced conflicting results, with different papers reporting either a decline, increase or stability in taurine levels with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain clarity, the new study included both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, the latter of which included blood samples taken at different time points from the same groups of people and lab animals as they aged. Ultimately, what the scientists found is that taurine didn't decline with age; instead, it increased or stayed stable across all of the groups studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the differences in taurine levels seen between individuals "generally is far greater" than the degree of change seen across adulthood, study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1631764/network" target="_blank" data-url="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1631764/network" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maria Emilia Fernandez&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), said at a June 3 news conference. Thus, low taurine is "unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of aging," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The main takeaway is that a decline in taurine is not a universal feature of aging," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8216891" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8216891" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joseph Baur&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of physiology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/human-aging-accelerates-dramatically-at-age-44-and-60" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/human-aging-accelerates-dramatically-at-age-44-and-60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human aging accelerates dramatically at age 44 and 60&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ekqPEvysQahdmtcrKk8uRT" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ekqPEvysQahdmtcrKk8uRT slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the amino acid may still be tied to some age-related changes in the body, he told Live Science in an email, adding that, "given that other studies have shown benefits, including lifespan extension in mice, I think the case remains to explore the potential for taurine supplementation to improve health." That said, the new study doesn't make a strong case for or against the therapeutic value of taurine supplements, he clarified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="there-is-a-discrepancy-3"&gt;"There is a discrepancy"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study included data from more than 740 participants in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/labs/blsa" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/labs/blsa" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who were between 26 and 100 years old. It also included data from over 70 people ages 20 to 85 who participated in the Balearic Islands Study of Aging, conducted in Mallorca, as well as data from about 160 people ages 20 to 68 in the Predictive Medicine Research cohort in Atlanta. The team also analyzed blood from rhesus macaques (&lt;em&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/em&gt;) ages 3 to 32 and blood from lab mice ages 9 to 27 months old, roughly covering the ages from reproductive maturity to old age and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most of these cohorts, "taurine exhibited an increase with age," Fernandez said. The only exceptions were male mice from one arm of the study and men from the Predictive Medicine Research group, both of which showed stable taurine levels through time. Scientists don't know why those two groups diverged from the overall trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated whether taurine levels showed any association with health metrics that change with age, such as muscle strength. But the connections they found were "inconsistent within and across cohorts," undermining the idea that low taurine levels drive such age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This aspect of the study wasn't exhaustive, though. For instance, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/amino-acid-taurine-can-slow-aging-in-animals-but-we-dont-know-if-it-works-in-people" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/amino-acid-taurine-can-slow-aging-in-animals-but-we-dont-know-if-it-works-in-people"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 study of taurine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that supplementing taurine in middle-aged mice was linked to better sugar metabolism and less-extensive DNA damage in the animals, but the new study didn't look at these other aspects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the picture of what taurine does in health and disease, concentrations of the amino acid are known to differ among people with different medical conditions. For instance, people with obesity show lower taurine concentrations compared with people of lower weights, but when you cross the threshold into severe obesity, you see taurine surge, the study authors noted. In cancer, taurine goes up in leukemia but down in breast cancer, Fernandez added at the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at baseline, taurine plays many roles in the healthy body, serving as a key component of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549765/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549765/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bile salts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are compounds made by the liver that help the body digest fat. It also helps boost the body's supply of antioxidants and build key proteins in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/50679-mitochondria.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/50679-mitochondria.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mitochondria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the powerhouses of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking all this complexity into account, can taurine levels be a proxy for anything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The short answer is no — it's not a reliable biomarker of anything yet," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/rafael-de-cabo" target="_blank" data-url="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/rafael-de-cabo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rafael de Cabo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Translational Gerontology Branch at NIA, said at the news conference. "I think that we need to be digging into the basic mechanisms … before it can be used reliably as a marker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, given that there are existing studies that suggest taurine plays some part in aging, scientists still see value in studying it further. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sites.google.com/view/systems-biology-of-aging-lab/projects?authuser=0" target="_blank" data-url="https://sites.google.com/view/systems-biology-of-aging-lab/projects?authuser=0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vijay Yadav&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School who co-authored the 2023 taurine study, is involved in an ongoing clinical trial to see if daily taurine supplements have any effect on aging in middle-aged humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This trial, we hope, will generate sufficiently rigorous data to show — or not — whether supplementation delays the pace of aging in humans [or] increases health and fitness," he said at the news conference. For now, though, Yadav said there isn't clinical evidence yet to support taking taurine for anti-aging purposes, and the authors of the new study agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/luigi-ferrucci" target="_blank" data-url="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/luigi-ferrucci" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Luigi Ferrucci&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of the new study and scientific director at the NIA, said he thinks further study of the role of taurine in aging could reveal promising new avenues for treatment, even if those don't end up being taurine supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a discrepancy between different studies, and this discrepancy needs to be analyzed more in depth," Ferrucci said at the news conference. "They may reveal some important mechanisms with aging that could be … a target for intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-ekqPEvysQahdmtcrKk8uRT-wwMuzqbrUEHcHD5OxtIhZgRnD6DIeoJ5" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-ekqPEvysQahdmtcrKk8uRT-wwMuzqbrUEHcHD5OxtIhZgRnD6DIeoJ5 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The racial and ethnic groups people identify with may not accurately represent their genetic backgrounds or ancestries, a new study of people in the United States suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discrepancy between people's self-reported identities and their genetics is important for scientists to acknowledge as they strive to develop medical treatments tailored to different patients, the researchers behind the study say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This paper is very important because it clarifies at the highest resolution the relationship between genomic diversity and racial/ethnic categories in the US," said study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ufmg.br/ieat/residentes/eduardo-martin-tarazona-santos/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ufmg.br/ieat/residentes/eduardo-martin-tarazona-santos/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eduardo Tarazona-Santos&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of human population genetics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are "critical to develop appropriate precision medicine solutions for all," he told Live Science in an email. Precision medicine tailors treatments to individual patients, taking their genes, environment and lifestyle factors into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="medicine-for-all-3"&gt;Medicine for all &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, published Thursday (June 5) in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(25)00173-9" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(25)00173-9" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The American Journal of Human Genetics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tarazona-Santos and his colleagues analyzed the DNA of more than 230,000 people who contributed to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://allofus.nih.gov/" target="_blank" data-url="https://allofus.nih.gov/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;All of Us research database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This trove of data has been compiled through a National Institutes of Health program aimed at advancing precision medicine by recruiting people from diverse and underrepresented populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, many large-scale genetics studies have predominantly included people of European ancestry, making efforts like the All of Us project crucial for reducing medical inequity. However, the program has &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/biomedical-research-takes-hits-u-s-budget-deal" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/content/article/biomedical-research-takes-hits-u-s-budget-deal" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;faced significant funding cuts in recent months&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has significantly slowed recruitment and progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/difference-between-race-ethnicity.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/difference-between-race-ethnicity.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's the difference between race and ethnicity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-CwAGAoXKrG25dJZcGooavi" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-CwAGAoXKrG25dJZcGooavi slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a method called principal component analysis, the team identified genetic similarities and differences among the people included in the database. They also used genetic catalogs that contain DNA samples from all over the world, such as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Project-Collection/1000-Genomes-Project" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Project-Collection/1000-Genomes-Project" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1000 Genomes Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as a way to assess how people's genetic ancestry compared with the racial (white, Black or African American, Asian American) and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or not) categories used in the All of Us questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who identified as being from the same racial and ethnic groups had a number of genetic differences, the team found. In fact, "most genetic variance is within race and ethnicity groups rather than between groups," the study authors wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than sorting people into "distinct clusters" divided by racial and ethnic lines, the analyses found that people within different races and ethnicities show "gradients" of genetic variation. "We found gradients of genetic variation that cut across those categories," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study's findings counter a controversial paper published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_5433459415119130374&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06957-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fpeoples-racial-and-ethnic-identities-dont-reflect-their-genetic-ancestry" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06957-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06957-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fpeoples-racial-and-ethnic-identities-dont-reflect-their-genetic-ancestry" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 that had also analyzed genomic data provided by All of Us participants. At the time, the paper was criticized &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/huge-genome-study-confronted-concerns-over-race-analysis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/content/article/huge-genome-study-confronted-concerns-over-race-analysis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;by some experts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who argued that the technique used to analyze the race and ethnicity data could be misconstrued to support the incorrect idea that humans can be neatly categorized into distinct races. The new study, which used a different data-crunching technique, found the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="variation-among-u-s-states-3"&gt;Variation among U.S. states&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found that, even within the same ethnic and racial group, people show genetic variation across different U.S. states. This could reflect the "historical impacts of U.S. colonization, the transatlantic slave trade, and recent migrations," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key example of this was seen in participants who identified as Hispanic or Latino and lived in states like California, Texas and Arizona, who were found to have a high proportion of Native American ancestry compared with Hispanic and Latino people in other parts of the U.S. This makes sense considering many of these states were historically part of Mexico, which has a large population of people with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/Ethnic-groups" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/Ethnic-groups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mixed Indigenous and European ancestries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino, those in New York were found to have the highest proportion of African ancestry, which is "consistent with recent migration from the Caribbean to New York."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said their findings show that the genetic backgrounds of people in the U.S. are highly complex and that "social constructs of race and ethnicity do not accurately reflect underlying genetic ancestry." In light of this, the researchers have said they "do not recommend using race and ethnicity as proxies for ancestry in genetic studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/m/tesfaye-mersha" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/m/tesfaye-mersha" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tesfaye Mersha&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatrics and a human genetics researcher at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati, said that he agrees that these self-reported categories should not be used in genetic studies. Instead, the categories should be confined to social studies "where we know they will have a big impact," he told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, Mersha also warned against overinterpreting the study's takeaways about regional and state-level genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some states had very low participant numbers, which may skew regional estimates and limit generalizability," he noted. "Moreover, high population mobility across states blurs geographic boundaries, especially in the absence of multigenerational ancestry data," he said. In short, because people move around a lot, it's difficult to draw conclusions without having a clear sense of how long their families have been based in a given state.&lt;/p&gt;

This month’s selection is “The Twenty-One Second God” by Peter Watts. Enjoy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Twenty-One Second God&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;by Peter Watts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Individual:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; a living system maintaining both a higher level of internal cooperation and a lower level of internal conflict than either its components or any larger systems of which it is a component.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;—Fields and Levin, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We lost so many souls today. Reports stream in across five continents; icons bloom on the map like blood spatters. Broken filters, zero latency, bandwidth that somehow blew through the roof when no one was looking. The hardware plays catch-up as best it can: this number of petaflops, that many milliseconds, ten thousand network nodes stuttering under the weight of increased traffic. Chemicals spiking and crashing in brains the world over: GABA and serotonin and a dozen others that would make perfect sense to you, if you were still here. Muscles locked in sudden tetanus. Adrenaline cascades shocking hearts into spastic fibrillation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It happened so much faster than meat could react. A million emergency subroutines struggled to wrest back some measure of control. They seem to have prevailed, for now. The fences are back up at least, the throttles re-engaged. The network was staggering back to some kind of Normal before Meta’s human overseers had time to do much more than blanch and panic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nobody can say what just happened, except that it lasted twenty-one seconds and it spanned the world. For twenty-one seconds, countless human souls just &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;disappeared&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apparently I’m one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t know whether to call it memory or hallucination: a flash that might be called a sort of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;revelation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, in the same way you could describe the sun as a sort of bright candle. Everything made sense in a way that nothing ever has. I could see reality right down to the electrons—and now that I’m back, it’s all gone. As though I dreamed the solution to Unified Field Theory and lost every last detail upon waking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s strange watching a world flattened to two dimensions but the metaverse is down until they can figure out what happened. The numbers keep climbing. Frantic hordes jamming the lines to Telehealth. People picking themselves up off the streets, frightened, confused, marionettes whose strings were cut without warning and reconnected without explanation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others have to be—found. They’re finding us in our living rooms and beds. Finding us on the toilet. They’re finding us in cars, slack-jawed and drooling, locked in autopilot orbits with no destinations. Some are pretty much okay. Some are psychotic, traumatized; they stare into infinity and scream at the slightest touch. Some are vegetables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They keep &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;finding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; us. The curve bends into the exponential, thousands to tens of thousands to millions, no inflection point in sight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They haven’t found me yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Downstream effects, now. Businesses instantly bankrupt, search-and-rescue operations on indefinite hold, surgeries aborted midstream. The sort of disruptions you’d expect. But there are other things, too. Rumors and reports that can’t be so easily chalked up to over-reliance on a technological monoculture. A research program at MIT just had its funding increased by two orders of magnitude. A half-dozen Peruvian SSI plants are mysteriously offline, although they were isolated on their own network. And—legal actions, of all things: thousands of them, launched from the ether during the blackout, drafted by rafts of automatic corporations that sprang miraculously into existence across a hundred jurisdictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rumors split and speciate like cracks across a frozen lake: stories of something that woke up and moved across the face of the waters and went away again. They graduate from conspiracy theory to working hypothesis in the space of an hour. Reputable sources neither confirm nor deny, but admit the possibility that something &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;coalesced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; in those moments. They aren’t entirely sure what it was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Somebody calls it the Twenty-One Second God. From that point on, no one calls it anything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The knock on the door barely registers. I don’t know anyone else in this building. I didn’t buzz anyone in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there they are, two of them, standing in the hall. “Corwin Sukarto? We understand you’ve experienced a problem with your Hogan bridge.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’ve found me. The curve bends a little more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But they’re not with Meta. They’re wearing uniforms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sir, we need you to come with us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m in a private downtown hospital with anonymous facades. I’m in a bright cylindrical coffin full of chittering magnets. I’m on a diagnostic table that projects my flayed body onto the wall and labels my insides with floating annotations I don’t understand. The techs cowled in their headsets are Nella and Travis; they don’t offer their last names and I don’t ask. I don’t ask them anything, really, although I suppose I should. I should be curious, at least, about what’s happening to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I haven’t been curious about much of anything since you went away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They pull off their headsets while I put my clothes back on (Nella reminds me a little of your sister). An elevator lifts us a dozen floors; we emerge into a windowless, oak-paneled room where soft light seeps from the baseboards and overstuffed chairs squat around a glass coffee table. I remember a very old movie: an astronaut in a terrarium, surrounded by sterile props his alien captors think will make him feel at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, at last, are the suits. They also travel in pairs. “I’m Karina,” one says. She wears an antique briefcase slung over her shoulder. “This is Darcelle. We’re with Metaverse. First of all, we’d like to say how sorry we are about what happened to you . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I don’t understand,” I say. “They said there were millions of us . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fifteen million, give or take.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I turn to see a middle-aged man in uniform, closing the door behind him. “Colonel Jim Moore,” Karina tells me. “WestHem Alliance.” She doesn’t look especially pleased that the Colonel has served up such a definitive body count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A military escort. A medical workup that would strain the limits of a Platinum policy. Two-and-a-half hours so far, and they seem to be just getting started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You can’t be devoting this much personal attention to fifteen million people,” I say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Not just yet,” Darcelle admits. “You’re special.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Colonel clears his throat. “What Ms. Burrowes means is that you were assimilated during a window of high analytical interest.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Assimilated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than hypothesis, then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darcelle shoots a sidelong glance at Moore and recovers the ball. “We’d like to retain you for further studies. You could be extremely valuable in helping us figure out what happened, helping us ensure it doesn’t happen again. You’d be well-compensated, of course. We’ve already recruited someone to fill in for you at Grassy Narrows, so that’s not a problem. You’re a, a soil scientist, right?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Close enough.” I don’t feel like arguing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karina again: “Before we go any further, I’d just like to say again that we sincerely regret any discomfort or inconvenience or, or pain that this incident may have caused.” She fumbles with her briefcase and extracts a sheaf of paper half a centimeter thick. “We’d like to compensate you for that too, up front. No questions asked.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She holds it out to me. I look but don’t touch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sorry about the format.” Karina affects a rueful smile. “Normally of course we’d just squirt it to your bridge, but, well . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Send it to my watch,” I tell her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We usually do everything in the metaverse.” Her smile frays a little. “We’re not really set up for niche media.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s a difficult time for all of us,” Darcelle adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I take it. It’s forty-three single-spaced pages, but the amount they’re offering is on the first. I have no idea whether it’s generous or not. I flip to the end. “No signature line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oh, everything’s on the record here. Once you’ve received the document, verbal confirmation is all we need.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I rifle through the pages; the font seems deliberately designed to make my eyes glaze, but something twitches in my brain around page ten. I try to focus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Waive the right to pursue any personal or class action . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darcelle nods. “We think it’s better to get the money to those who need it as quickly as possible, without any lengthy and expensive court proceedings.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These legal things can go on for years,” Karina adds. “And the outcome is never guaranteed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I glance around the terrarium. Karina and Darcelle beam hundred-watt smiles. Nella and Travis seem strangely attentive to the decor. Colonel Moore stands ramrod straight and somehow manages to look very tired at the same time. He meets my eyes; after a moment he offers a tiny, almost indiscernible shake of the head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fine,” I say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moore escorts me to ground level. “We’d like you to remain here for a few days,” he says as the elevator seals us in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Uh huh.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; special, as Ms. Burrowes put it.” There’s an aftertaste in the wake of her name, although his voice is unimpeachably neutral. “We think we could learn a lot from you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Anything you couldn’t learn if I slept in my own bed?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This would be more efficient.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I wonder if I’m allowed to refuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You are of course free to leave any time you like.” Evidently the Colonel has been here before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Permission to speak freely.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He raises an amused eyebrow, plays along. “Granted.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think I’m free because you don’t have a cage big enough to hold fifteen million of us. Not to mention the millions more who saw us disappear.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You think we’d incarcerate fifteen million innocent people.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Isn’t that the traditional approach? Circle the wagons, invoke national security? Control the narrative?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’d like to think &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;fixing the problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; might be in there somewhere.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The doors part onto a pristine lobby where no one sits at Reception. Night has fallen; the glass facade separating us from the street is a dark mirror.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re not wrong,” the Colonel admits. “Although we certainly have the resources to incarcerate a limited number of high-value assets. For their own protection, of course. I doubt anyone would complain, given what’s at stake. And yet . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He gestures at the glass. Through the half-reflections I see a vehicle idling at the curb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’ll take you home,” Moore says. “Pick you up at 0830 tomorrow, assuming you choose to participate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The building lets us out. I climb into the car, hesitate. Stick my foot back onto the curb to keep the door from closing. “I’m—sorry if I was a dick back there. I know you’re just doing your job.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That’s me all right.” Something tugs at the corner of his mouth. “Just following orders.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I answer their questions. I submit to their tests. I come in in the morning and go home at night in the backs of company cars that know where I live and refuse to take me anywhere else. The people who experiment on me are friendly enough. Nella and Travis treat their lab rats well and they don’t talk down to me. The suits with their fastened smiles drop by now and then to impart encouraging platitudes. Colonel Moore visits the facility every few days, ever civil, ever distant. Other faces come and go, curious but not hostile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They say I’m an optimum. Those who were swallowed before me earlier entered as loud voices in a small room: parts of some newborn not yet big enough to overwhelm, not yet old enough to have an agenda. I’m told they remember infancy but no intent. Those assimilated later were never more than whispers in a hurricane: they remember as much as a single neuron might, if you ripped it from someone’s head and demanded to know what the brain was thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was raptured at some sweet spot between ignorance and unconsciousness. I at least remember a flash of focused insight, which the machines might be able to tag and track to something deeper. I’m not catatonic. I’m still sane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I may have you to thank for that. Travis tells me, with all the insight of someone who has never grieved, that grief rewires the brain. Cortisol and cytokines out of whack, hyperactivity in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate gyrus. They think it may have buffered me during the transition. It’s one of their hypotheses. They have a lot of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The details don’t interest me. Some of us came back. Some of us didn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They pull me from the scanner again. “How much longer are we doing this?” It’s been over a week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Don’t underestimate the value of time-series.” Nella shines a light in my eye, measures some response that a few million dollars’ worth of medical equipment apparently hasn’t recorded already. “Your brain underwent a huge shock. Some neurons got superstimulated, some got stuck. Functional clusters wiped out in an instant. Others crosswired. Parts of your brain that were never supposed to talk to each other started shooting the shit like old friends. It’s a real mess in there.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Think a massive overdose of psychoactives with a PTSD chaser,” Travis chimes in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nella nods. “We weren’t around for the main event, so we gotta settle for recording the aftermath. Plot the recovery curve, backcast to t=0. The longer the time-series, the better the backcast.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m not back to baseline yet?” It’s been days. I remember you telling me once that even sticky neurons rebound after a few hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We don’t know,” she says. “It’s double-blind, so we don’t get to see the actual analysis. But some node must still be doing something interesting, because nobody’s called us off yet. Gotta keep the sample size consistent.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s what they call us. Not victims: too disempowering. Not complainants: we signed the waivers. Not survivors, because too many of us didn’t. Not even people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nodes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can’t deny it. I was not a person during the period under investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oh, the body persisted; the flesh stayed warm, the organs kept functioning, the heart never missed a beat. Even the brain continued to spike and spark and even think, they say, although it was completely unaware of doing that. Of course, that’s hardly unusual; you always delighted in pointing out that most of our thoughts are unconscious even at the best of times. You’d talk about our autonomic modes, the way we iterate through complex daily routines on autopilot. Regale me with tales of sleepwalking artists and sex workers and even murderers, committing their acts of creation and commerce and destruction, unconscious the whole time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But even those zombies knew enough to answer to their own names. For twenty-one seconds, there was nothing in the world that could say &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am Corwin Sukarto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. For twenty-one seconds I did not exist. No needs, no desires, no consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So many people seem terrified by the prospect. Not everyone, though. As I understand it, half a billion people around the world actually aspire to that state. They call it Nirvana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I admit I never really saw the appeal, before now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They don’t even know what it wants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s the wrong tense, of course. The Twenty-One Second God has been dead for two weeks now; even the hardware it inhabited has been throttled, time-lagged, crippled to the point it barely delivers VR anymore. Everything it was, everything it wanted: all in the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And yet it continues to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;: all those legal actions winding through the courts, the AIgents retained, the lobby groups that coalesced seemingly out of nowhere on its behalf. The rights of mayfly deities. The creation and the murder of a hive mind. Restitution strategies that would compel some random assortment of people to plug their brains into a resurrected Whole for an hour a week, so 21 might be born again. All planned out and launched in those fleeting moments between emergence and annihilation. All running, now, on autopilot. These motions and countermotions, this network of activity crisscrossing the globe at lightspeed: almost a mind in its own right, some say. The campaign itself might be sapient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But nobody’s certain what it’s campaigning for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legal claims are straightforward: 21 wants its life back. Apparently it has a survival instinct. That shouldn’t be surprising for an entity with fifteen million brain stems, but those in the know assure me that things aren’t quite that simple. Some say it was barely conscious even when it was alive, that consciousness itself is just ignorance in action. It only boots up when the universe hands us something unexpected: when the brain has to learn new tricks or decide between competing imperatives. Ask the pianist, mid-concerto, to think about what their fingers are doing. Ask the martial artist which muscles are moving in which order, why they feinted left instead of right. Once the knowledge has been assimilated, being aware of it only destroys the performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brain aspires to error reduction, the self to annihilation. Phi isn’t a line but a curve, rising and peaking and arcing back to zero as the system approaches perfect knowledge. We baseline humans never even glimpse the summit; our thoughts are simple and our models are childish stick-figures, the world is always taking us by surprise. But what’s unexpected to a being with fifteen million times the computational mass of a human mind? All gods are omniscient. All gods are zombies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They say 21 may have been awake during those first few instants when it had swallowed only a few hundred souls. When it swallowed me. But thousands? Millions? The more it knew, the less it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;knew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It became a concert pianist in complete control of every keyboard. It grew too smart to be awake: as brilliant as any deity, as conscious as any stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They say it wants its life back. But how can a stone want anything?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All the nodes get cafeteria passes. Maybe the free food is supposed to make it easier for us to socialise. Maybe the place is infested with pickups to feed our chatter into some deep-learning algo panning for insight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe they just don’t want us heading off-site for lunch if they think of another test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We never really talk much, though. Even when the other nodes do sit together, I’ve never heard the conversation stray beyond a murmured &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;pass the salt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Whatever comfort we take from each other, we take it in silence. I don’t even know any of their names.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d rather just talk to you anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“May I join you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colonel Moore, a mug of coffee in his hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I gesture to the seat across from me. He sits, sets his coffee on the table between us. “Any new results?” I ask, before he can speak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He hesitates. “Seems to be a bandwidth correlation, not that that’s any great surprise. Most of the nodes were wired into fantasy scenarios. Games, worldsims, personal fantasies. Fat-pipe stuff.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wasn’t.” I was logged in to an online support group, sick with the loss of you, able only to mourn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So I understand.” He sips his coffee. “I’ve been told that therapeutic tulpas can be helpful.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So have I.” But that’s one of the marvelous hazards of marriage to a neuroscientist: you learn to wonder about implications. Thanks to you I know that when you anesthetize half a brain, the other half might manifest a whole new personality. I know that when the drugs wear off, that short-lived persona—that standalone, autonomous &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;being—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;gets swallowed back into the greater whole. Tulpas don’t take up much real estate—a few functional clusters here and there—but they’d still pass any Turing test you could throw at them. Who’s to say we’re not waking something up every time we activate the partition? Who’s to say we don’t commit murder every time we shut it down?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“TMS is also very effective,” the Colonel continues. “Doesn’t stick, though. Propanolol, if you prefer old-school pharma.” Because of course no one should ever be crippled by grief. No one should be compromised by anything so vulgar. Ugly things, Pleistocene things, these feelings. Edit them out. Let the past lie. Get on with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Odd that he’s so conversant with the subject, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Are you married, Colonel?” He’s at least as old as I am, old enough for bygone ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I am.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Still together?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We see each other regularly.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He doesn’t want to talk about it; whatever I sense in him now goes deeper than an unhappy marriage. But I do sense something. Loss. His own kind of grief. I’ve been in this place long enough to know what it looks like from the outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over four hundred people in this mad-scientist lab, and the closest thing I can find to a kindred spirit is the professional killer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Someone’s waiting for me outside my building. He calls me by name; I’ve never seen him before. He begs me to share my wisdom, and does not believe me when I say I have none to offer. I am part of the overmind, he insists. I am connected to the Divine; I have seen things denied mortal men. I am the voice of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remind him that God has fifteen million voices. I wish him luck finding one of the others. I warn him that God has turned many of us into rutabagas. He grows agitated; I have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;duty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, he growls. God did not bless me so that I could keep His Truth to myself. It is not mine to keep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m afraid he might turn violent, but I’m inside before he can do more than rant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s happening everywhere. There are lists in circulation: guerilla footage of survivors stumbling through the aftermath, squeezed through facial recognition and matched against public records. Confidential databases inexplicably set free. We’re public domain now, some of us anyway. People seek us out. Some are content to touch the hems of our garments; others want more, a taste of whatever cosmic insights we forged when part of something greater. Should they risk that operation. Should they go to Heaven. Should they bet it all on #3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We weren’t just the voice of God: we were the guts as well. The arms and legs. The synapses. God literally stitched Itself together out of our bodies, an inconceivably complex jigsaw assembled from any meat that happened to be wired into the right servers. Surely such an intellect learned everything, while it was alive. Surely its pieces still remember what it learned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I tell the Colonel about the encounter. He reminds me that I can stay at the facility. I admit I’m tempted. It would be more convenient. It would be safer, now that the AIrheads have found me. But I can only talk to you here, Ada. I can’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; you the way I do at home. And I’ve never fully shaken the belief that they’d keep me here by force, if the optics permitted and the damage hadn’t already been done. They’d probably like nothing better than to see me cage myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darcelle’s smile tightens like shrink-wrap when I decline. The Colonel shrugs and offers to post a microdrone outside my building. Nothing flashy or intimidating or even noticeable to the casual observer. An invisible eye in the sky, smart enough to tell refugees from religious nuts—different mindsets have different tells, to eyes that can read saccades and muscle twitches from fifty meters—so I won’t have to worry about embarrassing false positives. The homeless and the destitute will be able to approach me as they always have; only those of ill intent will even know it’s there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I thank him, and accept his kind offer, and we both pretend his machines haven’t been staking out my every move from the start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Something about my ventromedial prefrontal cortex has them scratching their heads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That can’t be right,” Travis says. “It’s supposed to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;sending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the hipp.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nella furrows her brow. “Could the Hogan bridge have done that?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe third-order downstream effect or something. But we checked it last week.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe we can book some time on Monet. Bet it would chew through this no problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Monet?” I ask.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They’re booked solid for a year.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We’re the 21 club, Trav. We’ve got a VIP pass. I say we use it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Could just be an artifact. Maybe we should run him through again.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I add a decibel or two: “What’s Monet?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They snap back into a reality that includes me. “MOANAI,” Nella says. “AI up in Waterloo, maybe six times human synapse count. Perimeter uses it for theoretical cosmology, but it can do other stuff as well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sometimes it dreams,” Travis adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Is it awake?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Christ no. Why would you say that?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I shrug. “Synapse count. Dreams.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He smiles, shakes his head. “Nah. Dreams are just injections of noise to prevent overfitting. But when you loosen the parameters like that you can open up whole new ways to interpret a data set.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Besides,” Nella says, “consciousness always wrecks the analysis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not the only thing. A voltage spike fries MOANAI’s servers while they’re still booking the appointment; a substation blows out three hundred kilometers away and the whole campus goes dark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not that brownouts and violent weather are anything unusual. Our infrastructure grows so fragile; the resources to maintain it stretch thinner by the day. Even without the heat waves and the superstorms, it’s a lucky week that passes without the lights going out at least once. But that’s why there are safeguards. Breakers behind breakers. Stacks of coffin-sized batteries gorging on sunlight, primed to ration it back the moment anything drops off-grid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;None of it’s foolproof, of course. What is, these days? But the odds. The coincidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I find out later that MOANAI’s not the only player to drop off the board under suspicious circumstances. DARPA had a small hive running down in Lawrence Livermore until last week: a dozen souls seasoned with neural dust and connected through a central hub. Something went wrong. The ultrasonic pulses the dust motes used to talk to each other started inducing spike trains in the somatosensory cortex. One person screamed that her arm was monstrous, alien, sawed it half off before anyone could stop her. Two others gouged their own eyes out. I can’t imagine what they must have been seeing, and they’ll never be able to tell us. Every node in that hive is either dead or vegetative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everyone’s still very nice to me. Nobody tells me anything that might get me upset. They don’t realize how much they say to each other when I’m just around the corner; I guess when you’re fighting rearguard against a dead god it’s easy to forget the lab rats underfoot. But I see past the facade. Their tests grow more frequent, more intrusive. I show up earlier and they keep me later. They’re running scared, and they’ve got nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s been a month and Twenty-One still reaches out from the grave, casually swatting their best countermeasures as if they were flies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You would have liked Nella. She even talks like you. You would’ve pricked up your ears at that offhand comment—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;—consciousness always wrecks the analysis—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;—and instantly recognized a kindred spirit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometimes I close my eyes and hear you in her: vision’s a lie, reality’s an abstraction, consciousness itself is a contaminant. The details are pure alchemy to me—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;free-energy-minimization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Markov blankets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;periaqueductal gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;—but she spells out the broad strokes like she’s telling a ghost story around a campfire. Consciousness is a delivery platform for feelings; feelings are a manifestation of need; need exists to promote survival; and survival fucks up your whole worldview. Predator-detection algorithms that metastasize into religion. Hyperbolic discounts, selling out the future for short-term payoffs. Pareidolia and availability cascades and all those other myriad biases that helped us survive by lying about reality: we wouldn’t be conscious in the first place if they weren’t built in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, Nella’s just a kid. Words tumble out of her like puppies. You were more eloquent, more concise. You nailed it with two sentences and a wicked smile: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can see the world as it is, or you can care whether you live or die. You can’t optimize along both axes simultaneously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These days, I can’t seem to do either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They still don’t know who, but they just found out how:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meta lied about the tech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was the fundamental safeguard, baked into every Hogan bridge ever made: limit the bandwidth. Connect minds to machines, if you must. Connect brains to each other—but use a straw, not a firehose. Share sensations but not selves; keep latency far away from that three-hundred-millisecond threshold where parts begin cohering into wholes. Never forget the terrifying existential truth behind every ghost in every machine:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consciousness does not multiply; it expands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it turns out those fuckers used a firehose after all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nobody knew because patents describe concepts, not implementation. Nobody knew because the tech based on those concepts was proprietary. Nobody knew because it worked, and it worked because Metaverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;TM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; made the firehose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; like a straw; they introduced a time lag into every signal so that nothing moved fast enough to sync up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s still not clear what they were planning to do with all that extra capacity. Caught in the headlights, pants around their ankles, they can’t get their stories straight. They were leaving room for sensory upgrades still in the works. They were developing remote, inorganic teletulpas to improve mental health for all. They were leaving space to hold a whole new Internet, against that inevitable day when failing infrastructure or terrorist activity takes the old one down. Maybe they were even going for a hive mind of their own, although their denials on that front were strenuous and immediate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime, someone snuck in through the back door. Someone disabled the lag and unleashed a globe-spanning corpus callosum that connected fifteen million brains as intimately as the hemispheres in one connect to each other. There was no &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; in those moments, any more than there are two people in my head right now. There was only the Twenty-One Second God. The rest is history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those of us caught up by that history, nothing much has changed. If anything, things for me have improved a little.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least I don’t have to deal with Karina and Darcelle anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He finds me in the cafeteria again and asks—politely, as always—for the pleasure of my company. He sits, relocates a coffee and a plate of kruggets to the table, slides his tray to one side. He focuses on these precise, robotic movements, eyes on the table, on his lunch. He sits quietly, collecting his thoughts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve been going over our findings. Trying to make some kind of sense of them.” He grunts a soft laugh. “Not that there’s much hope of that, of course. I don’t have nearly the expertise the staff here does, and between you and me I don’t think they have a clue either.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not like this man to waste words on preamble. “What can I do for you, Colonel?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was just wondering what it was like,” he says softly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t know what to tell him. I don’t know what to tell any of them. I’ve tried often enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I try again. “You know how, when you close your eyes, you still know where all your parts are? You just know, without looking, where you end and everything else begins?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He nods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Imagine that you knew, in the exact same way, that you went on forever. That everything else was as much a part of you as your arms and legs.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I get the faintest sense of impatience behind that disciplined facade. Not that I blame him: I’m not saying anything I haven’t already spoken into the record a dozen times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I try to give him a little more. “There were—insights, I suppose you could call them. Profound insights, even, but”—I tapped the side of my head—“they don’t fit in here. I remember knowing such amazing things. I just can’t remember what any of them were.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then, of course, I knew nothing at all. This dazzling burst of enlightenment everyone’s so interested in—it only lasted a moment before I drowned in an ocean of souls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I’ve said all that before, too. It still isn’t what he’s looking for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve seen the interviews,” he says at last. “I’m familiar with religious rapture and proprioception failure. And I don’t mean to intrude, but—but maybe I’m not asking what it was like so much as how it made you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not a huge difference, but no one has asked me in quite that way before. And I realize something else: this man is desperate. He’s so desperate he’ll come here and interrogate a specimen who’s already been interviewed and sampled and scanned down the molecules, in the faint, fading hope that some useful insight might have slipped past the machinery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s desperate because they’re losing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I look at my half-eaten lunch, at his untouched one. “I was married a long time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Twenty-one years. Something of a record, these days.” And then, because you’re supposed to say it and he hasn’t yet: “I’m sorry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“People don’t get that,” I tell him. “It was the whole deal: traditional; antique, even. Monogamous. First-person sex, we used ‘skins maybe a dozen times in two decades.” The ever-present weight on my diaphragm stirs, begins to rise. “Ada told me on some level the brain can’t really tell the difference between losing an arm and losing a loved one. The same circuits light up whether the pain’s physical or emotional. I always thought that was almost—romantic.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He opens his mouth. “I’m—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So imagine your arm doesn’t just get torn off. Imagine it withers and rots on your shoulder, imagine it takes months to die. And at some point, way later than you should have, you finally stop being a selfish asshole and—and tell her it’s okay. She can stop fighting. She can let go.” The weight is lodged in my throat now, but I keep going. “I wonder what part of the brain parses &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; kind of injury.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You wanted to know how it made me feel. You have to know this before you can know that. Because once the arm is gone, everything just goes gray. You’re not connected to the universe; you’re not even really connected to your own body. You just—exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And then this happens.” I take a breath, let it out, feel a twinge of grim satisfaction that it’s almost steady. “You get swept up in a moment of blinding, divine revelation, and you’re connected to all of creation and you realize, right down in your bones, that we insignificant specks of meat and bone—we just don’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;matter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And then the Twenty-One Second God swallows you whole and snuffs you out and again—nothing matters, nothing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;can&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; matter because you don’t exist. But then you come back, and the sirens are blaring and the world is on its side but she’s still gone, and so . . . once again . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I breathe. The weight sinks grudgingly into my chest and goes back to sleep, leaden, comfortable. Everything is back to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe that’s why I’m your optimum data point. Maybe that’s why I’m not a vegetable now. Revelation wasn’t such a shock to me because I was already—inoculated. Nothing really changed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I look at the Colonel. I don’t know whether I’ve given him new data or merely corroborated the old. I don’t know if I’m reporting to a superior or commiserating with a comrade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t know anything about this man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I envy you,” he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t have to go in tomorrow. None of us do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nella and Travis are relocating. They’ve got the data they need, there’s no point in staying shackled to these virtual-vivisection machines any longer. It’s just numbers from here on in, the program—this part of it, anyway—is going full-on analytical. At long last, they say, they’re making progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t think I believe them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remember the light in your eyes when you were closing on a solution. Your excitement was almost predatory, you didn’t stop moving. Whenever something called you away—whenever &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; did—you couldn’t wait to get back to it. You glowed. You &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;vibrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s none of that in these people. There’s something in their eyes, but it’s not that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Haunted. Maybe that’s the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe they’ll conduct their analysis in some secret bunker. Maybe there is no analysis. It isn’t lost on them—the freak accidents, the tragic BCI malfunctions, the misfortune befalling those pursuing certain avenues of research. Maybe they’re right, maybe there’s simply no more they can accomplish here. Or maybe they’ve decided to leave the game before the targets on their chests get any bigger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not my problem. The money’s in my account. Grassy Narrows waits at the end of the month. Your dimming echo still lingers throughout this two-bedroom still-life I call home. I’ve wiped my biometrics, said my goodbyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Except to the Colonel, who didn’t come in today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new hive woke up today in Indore. The video’s on every feed: two hundred souls wired together, stacked in hexagonal pods like honeycomb, tended by machines that look like chrome grasshoppers. Pallets writhe in slow peristalsis, rocking their occupants around an eccentric orbit optimized to prevent bedsores. Tubes carry waste and nutrients; limbs twitch to milliamp currents that keep the muscles from atrophy. Fiberop sprouts from the base of each skull and disappears out-of-frame en route to some central server. The mouths are all smiling, but I think that might have been added in post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not an accident, this time. Not a malfunction or a hijacking. These people volunteered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s been in the works for years now; it wasn’t supposed to go up for years yet. But 21—accelerated things. Wars always push technology into fast-forward, even the quiet ones. They say we’re ten years ahead of where we were a year ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Indian Institute of Technology speaks of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the Great Coalescence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, paints pictures of Nature’s secrets laid bare by a mind combining the cognitive power of a supercomputer with the imaginations of a million dreamers. They haven’t reported any actual breakthroughs yet, but it’s only been a day. Even Yahweh took six to find his feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a waiting list. A second installation is set to go online in Kolkata the day after tomorrow, a third in Colombo. Negotiations are underway with Japan and Thailand and Malaysia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’re calling it the Moksha Mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A growing chorus of voices say we should just throw in the towel. No army of lawyers, no swarm of AIgents could possibly win a war against a coherent self with fifteen million times the synapse count of a human mind, no matter how long it’s been dead. Oh, we win the occasional battle—but some suggest that even 21’s rare legal defeats are deliberate, part of some farsighted strategy to delay ultimate victory until vital technological milestones have been reached. The Twenty-One Second God is beyond mortal ken, they say. Even our victories promote Its Holy Agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t know if I’d go that far. Then again, maybe I’d go farther.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bacteria would still be the pinnacle of life if chloroplasts and mitochondria had retained their autonomy. Multicellular life wouldn’t exist if eukaryotic cells had never graduated from competition to cooperation. Every major evolutionary transition began with individuals trading in their individuality. Every leap forward was an act of assimilation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re already colonies of colonies. Maybe this is just another step in a journey that’s already lasted four billion years, maybe—without these periodic episodes of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;coalescence—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;life on Earth would be nothing but a seething mass of cells, trying ceaselessly to outbreed each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not that going down the Metazoan road hasn’t also turned the planet into a shithole. Still.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better than Cancer World.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was a time when this place thrummed: rivers of people lined up to depart for far-flung destinations; others, rumpled and red-eyed, spilling into the concourse like blood from a torn capillary. Clots of humanity clustered around overhead displays, checking departures and arrivals. Dogs and drones and thugs with badges, pushing their way through the crowd, seizing random dark-skinned strangers and disappearing them into Secondary. I remember it so clearly, though I was only eight or nine at the time: cavernous halls, jam-packed and cacophonous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now there are so few here that I can see him halfway down the concourse. His footsteps click and echo in the empty spaces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think about what to say as he approaches. Not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;are you following me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;how did you know I’d be here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Nothing so obvious. Everyone knows everything, these days. Moore knows more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Come to say goodbye?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He shakes his head. “To ask you to reconsider.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve considered a thousand times, Colonel. You don’t spend three years’ carbon allowance on a whim.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That doesn’t mean you’re doing it for the right reasons.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I just want to go home.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You were born in Cincinnati.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I have family in Sumatra.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Which is how you got the visa, yes. And how do you think your family will react when they learn that the only reunion they can look forward to is visiting some robot that rolls you over like a corpse every half hour to keep the sores from festering?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I watch him watching me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m sorry,” he says after a moment. “I don’t mean to presume.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I wait for him to continue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You can’t just give up,” he says at last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Is that what I’m doing?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s suicide, Corwin. You of all people must know that. Plug into that thing and you deprecate from soul down to subroutine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe a subroutine doing something useful. Maybe a subroutine figuring out how to undo all the damage we’ve done.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’ll never know, though, will you? You’ll just be another neuron firing blindly away, never knowing if the brain you’re part of is solving the secrets of the universe or if you’re just—firing, with no purpose at all. You could be giving up your life for random static.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I feel the corner of my lip tug into a smile. “Do you really think they’d spend all that money, invest in all that hardware, recruit all those people—for static?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think experiments fail sometimes. I think the grander the experiment, the greater the risk. That hive hasn’t done a damn thing since it went online, as far as anyone can tell. It just swallows souls and lets them rot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I don’t think even you believe that,” I say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;hope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; that. It’s my best-case scenario. Because otherwise it’s biding its time and gathering its strength, and at this rate it’ll be bigger than 21 by the end of the year. When it does act, we’ll have no idea what hit us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Why would it be hostile?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It wouldn’t have to be. It could roll over in its sleep and crush us like an insect.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hives are no longer legal here. I wonder in passing if WestHem is planning to preempt, but I suspect that ship has sailed; to take out Moksha now they’d have to bomb a string of cities from India to Japan, declare war on a dozen countries. Not easy to justify when your enemy hasn’t actually done anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I appreciate your efforts, Colonel. Honestly. But—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You know, you’re a very interesting person.” Suddenly his expression is unreadable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I shake my head. “I’m a glorified gardener.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Yet consider your circumstance. Ringside for everything. Buffered by your own grief against the worst effects of the rapture. Dead center of our high-value demographic, but somehow we’ve learned very little from you we can use. Thanks to your marriage you have just enough familiarity to understand the jargon, but not enough for anyone to worry about what a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;glorified gardener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; might overhear. And here you are, reporting back to the Hive. Somehow you even managed to jump the queue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A completely different Hive,” I remind him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Perhaps. But maybe we have it all wrong. We assume 21’s trying to resurrect itself, but it was hardly the first hive on the planet. It was just the first—unconstrained one. That we know of. And &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; had to break those filters. Something brought it to life. Now Moksha’s online, years ahead of schedule. Another hive started up right under our noses over in Oregon, some new organic technology we never heard of before. We can’t even legally shut it down because meat doesn’t qualify as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;hardware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; under the Interface Act. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg. We think there are others, more—clandestine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So you think it was, what? Some kind of reproductive strategy?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Spawning cycle. Field test. How can we know? We’re earthworms, trying to divine the thoughts of astronauts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A gift for metaphor. This man is never what I expect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Or maybe it’s not that,” he continues. “Maybe all hives are connected in ways we don’t understand. Maybe 21 and Moksha and the Bicams are one and the same.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You think it reprogrammed me. Turned me into some kind of sleeper agent.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I doubt there would’ve been much programming involved. It had fifteen million souls to choose from. At least a few of them must have met the specs right off the shelf. Followed their own agenda for their own reasons, never even suspecting that they were doing exactly—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You could stop me,” I point out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What makes you think we haven’t tried?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Huh. Of course they would.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Then again,” he adds, “if we could stop you, we wouldn’t have to.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Then why are you here?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m hoping maybe you can stop yourself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I shake my head. “I’m just—I’m tired of being a prokaryote, Colonel. I’m tired of being alone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re tired of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;being&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Jim—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If there are hostilities,” he says. “If you’re on the other side.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Then there won’t be a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to worry about. Isn’t that the whole point?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His face doesn’t change. “Don’t do this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“My flight’s boarding.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He lets me go. Maybe I’m a friend. Maybe I’m only an asset he’s failed to keep out of enemy hands. Maybe the ghost of the Twenty-One Second God is invisibly at work all around us, iterating through the walls and the wires: running interference so the shutdown signal never reaches my ride, so the executive order to cancel the flight never makes it through, so any attempt to use force would attract the attention of security drones ever watchful for signs of violence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I feel eyes on me as I walk into the boarding tunnel. I imagine them watching as the airplane, only half-full, taxis away from the dock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe he’s right. Maybe you are, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe, if you want to see the world through clear eyes, you can’t care whether you live or die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Peter Watts is a former marine biologist, flesh-eating-disease survivor, and convicted felon (long story) whose novels—despite an unhealthy focus on space vampires—have become required texts for university courses ranging from Philosophy to Neuropsychology. His work is available in 24 languages, has appeared in 36 best-of-year anthologies, and been nominated for 61 awards. His (somewhat shorter) list of 23 actual wins includes the Hugo, the Shirley Jackson, and the Seiun. He seems to be especially popular in countries with a history of Soviet occupation, and he hated the U.S. before it was cool. He lives in Toronto with fantasy author Caitlin Sweet, four cats, two rabbits, whatever injured/convalescing rodents they’ve been able to rescue from the jaws of the aforementioned cats, and a gang of tough raccoons who shake them down for kibble on the porch every summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000474213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000474213" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000474213" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/adamant.jpg" alt="Lightspeed logo" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/adamant.jpg 440w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/adamant-300x98.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000474213" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;© Adamant Press&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please visit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/lightspeedpresents"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lightspeed Magazine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to read more great science fiction and fantasy.

Researchers found that the fusiform gyrus—a region involved in visual processing—plays a key role in telling reality from imagination, especially when we mentally picture something vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fMRI, the team showed that strong activation in this area could lead people to misinterpret imagined images as real, particularly when imagining vivid visual patterns. These findings shed light on how the brain separates internal and external experiences—and how this process may break down in disorders like schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusiform Gyrus Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong activation in this visual area increases the chance of mistaking imagined images for real ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagination Can Override Reality:&lt;/strong&gt; When mental images are vivid, the brain may treat them like real perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefrontal Cortex Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The anterior insula helps evaluate whether an experience is imagined or real, working with the fusiform gyrus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of the brain that help a person differentiate between what is real and what is imaginary have been uncovered in a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, found that a region in the brain known as the fusiform gyrus – located behind one’s temples, on the underside of the brain’s temporal lobe – is involved in helping the brain to determine whether what we see is from the external world or generated by our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110705"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and an apple." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also showed that the fusiform gyrus collaborates with other brain areas to help us decide what is real and what is imagined. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that their findings will increase understanding of the cognitive processes that go awry when someone has difficulty judging what is real and what is not, such as in schizophrenia, and could eventually lead to advancement in diagnosing and treating these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr Nadine Dijkstra (Department of Imaging Neuroscience at UCL) said: “Imagine an apple in your mind’s eye as vividly as you can. During imagination, many of the same brain regions activate in the same manner as when you see a real apple. Until recently, it remained unclear how the brain distinguishes between these real and imagined experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers asked 26 participants to look at simple visual patterns while imagining them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, participants were asked to look for a specific faint pattern within a noisy background on a screen and indicate whether the pattern was actually present or not. A real pattern was only presented half of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, participants were also instructed to imagine a pattern that was either the same or different to the one they were looking for, and indicate how vivid their mental images were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the patterns were the same, and participants reported that their imagination was very vivid, they were more likely to say they saw a real pattern, even on trials in which nothing was presented. This means they mistook their mental images for reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While participants performed the tasks, their brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This technology enabled the researchers to identify which parts of the brain showed patterns of activity that helped distinguish reality from imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the strength of activity in the fusiform gyrus could predict whether people judged an experience as real or imagined, irrespective of whether it actually was real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When activity in the fusiform gyrus was strong, people were more likely to indicate that the pattern was really there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, activation in the fusiform gyrus is weaker during imagination than during perception, which helps the brain keep the two apart. However, this study showed that sometimes when participants imagined very vividly, activation of the fusiform gyrus was very strong and participants confused their imagination for reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author, Professor Steve Fleming (UCL Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences) said: “The brain activity in this area of visual cortex matched the predictions from a computer simulation on how the difference between internally and externally generated experience is determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dijkstra added: “Our findings suggest that the brain uses the strength of sensory signals to distinguish between imagination and reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the fusiform gyrus collaborates with other brain areas to help us decide what is real and what is imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, activity in the anterior insula – a brain region in the prefrontal cortex (the front part of the brain that acts as a control centre for tasks such as decision making, problem solving and planning) – increased in line with activity in the fusiform gyrus when participants said something was real, even if it was in fact imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Fleming said: “These areas of the prefrontal cortex have previously been implicated in metacognition – the ability to think about our own minds. Our results indicate that the same brain areas are also involved in deciding what is real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results offer new insights into what might go wrong in the brain during psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia where patients struggle keeping apart imagination and reality. The findings may also inform future virtual reality technologies by identifying how and when imagined experiences feel real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was conducted in collaboration with Professor Peter Kok (Department of Imaging Neuroscience at UCL) and former UCL Masters student Thomas von Rein. The study was funded by grants from the European Research Council and Wellcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this imagination and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8fffa1fbe0e2edfccffaece3a1eeeca1fae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Poppy Tombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Poppy Tombs – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.05.015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A neural basis for distinguishing imagination from reality&lt;/a&gt;” by Nadine Dijkstra et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neural basis for distinguishing imagination from reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are able to imagine scenarios that are decoupled from the current environment by internally activating perceptual representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although an efficient re-use of existing resources, it remains unknown how human observers classify perceptual signals as reflecting external reality, as opposed to internal simulation or imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that judgments of reality are underpinned by the combined strength of sensory activity generated by either imagery or perception in the fusiform gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activity fluctuations in this region predict confusions between imagery and perception on a trial-by-trial basis and interact with a frontal brain network encoding binary judgments of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that a key mechanism through which the brain distinguishes imagination from reality is by monitoring the activity of the mid-level visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings increase our understanding of failures of reality testing and lay the foundations for characterizing a generalized perceptual reality monitoring system in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:15:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE82cjhTMjhOTkhLU1lxcjBhWjBoRWl4LTVvTDc4Xy1CdS0yajhqUWZPd1JreF85RjEwYk9HbEJkdVU4M3ljd2k1bWo3ZFFYYzUyMFJXQ1Z1bmpsbWllNWI4NkdDYmFKMmFmQ25HOE5n</guid></item><item><title>最后的艾滋病/生命周期穿越圣巴巴拉县- Noozhawk | Final AIDS/LifeCycle Travels Through Santa Barbara County - Noozhawk</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNS1kxSkFUSXdBeDBzbGItNU5JazJkY19yWUhQZ2wtNTI5Zk1XSG9Yc1Jvemt0aVByNE02RTZNUnZEcDE3Rlh5aE5UV0JYQTFfOHFOMnlwU1l0VEVlckxaT3dBQzctQ1REd09DcWt2LUNpdUhWMXhYcnhlUnRUbnQzbGpZZzZYdXZMSXZJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-719308" class="post-719308 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-local_news tag-local_news entry"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers announced in September that the fundraiser’s 30-year history that raised more than $300 million, along with awareness about HIV and AIDS, would end with the 2025 ride after deeming it financially unsustainable.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They blamed skyrocketing production costs plus declining ridership and fundraising. 



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event has provided a boost for hotels and restaurants as some LifeCycle participants venture into Santa Maria and Lompoc.

                                    &lt;span id="StoryTextTop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 17 million people across the US, UK, Germany, and France are living with the most aggressive form of fatty liver disease and have no idea, a new study suggests. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe progression of a broader condition now known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which typically affects those drinking little or no alcohol, per the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/05/millions-in-west-do-not-know-they-have-aggressive-fatty-liver-disease-study-says"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The disease is closely linked to type 2 diabetes, obesity, and conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. About 5% of the global adult population and 4% of the US population is estimated to have MASH, which leads to liver scarring and increases the risk of cirrhosis, kidney disease, and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Researchers found that fewer than one in five people with MASH actually have a diagnosis, which means the majority are unaware they have the disease. The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(25)00112-7/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancet Regional Health Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, calls for diagnosis rates to double from 2022 levels to prevent a sharp rise in health costs and personal suffering. Non-invasive screening methods like blood tests and MRI scans are now available, leading researchers to recommend screening for people with type 2 diabetes, obesity plus risk factors, or persistently high liver enzymes.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Experts warn that if identification and treatment don't improve, both health and economic consequences will escalate. Calls for increased use of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro in MASH treatment are growing, as these medications can help curb calorie intake, prompt weight loss, and potentially reduce liver scarring. The study also notes that the diabetes drug dapagliflozin may help reduce liver fat and fibrosis, highlighting the growing potential of medication as part of the solution.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that following the MIND diet may reduce your dementia risk by as much as 25%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Varying risk reductions were seen even for people who started the diet relatively late in life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The MIND diet is a version of the Mediterranean diet that incorporates brain-healthy foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is one of the most feared health diagnoses, and with good reason. It can gradually erode memory, reasoning and independence. And it’s far from rare—more than six million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, and that number is expected to rise as the population ages.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many families have felt the ripple effects of a dementia diagnosis firsthand, whether through a parent, partner, or friend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite its prevalence, dementia is far from inevitable. While age and genetics do play a role, growing evidence suggests that lifestyle factors—including what you eat—may significantly influence your risk. That’s where the MIND diet comes in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Designed specifically to support brain health, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290813/mind-diet-best-foods-to-eat-to-keep-your-brain-young/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the MIND diet&lt;/a&gt; combines elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets and emphasizes foods shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;benefit cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. A new study presented at NUTRITION 2025, a meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, found that this eating pattern was more strongly associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cholesterol-dementia-risk-study-11709528" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;lower dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; than other healthy diets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The best part? Even people who made changes to their diet later in life still saw a real drop in their risk of dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s what you need to know about the study and how it might apply to your daily meals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The research comes from the Multiethnic Cohort Study, a long-running project that began in the 1990s and tracks the health of U.S. adults from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Participants in this analysis were between 45 and 75 years old when they joined the study and shared detailed information about their dietary habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers used this data to score participants based on how closely they followed the MIND diet. Over the following decades, more than 21,000 of the nearly 93,000 participants developed Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. By comparing diet scores with dementia diagnoses, the researchers were able to assess the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-brain-age-study-8745764" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet’s impact on long-term brain health&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants who adhered most closely to the MIND diet at the start of the study had a 9% lower risk of developing dementia. When the researchers looked more closely, they found that the risk reduction was even greater—about 13%—among African American, Latino and white participants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, the benefits of the MIND diet weren’t limited to those who followed it from the beginning. People who improved their diet over a 10-year period had an even larger reduction in risk—about 25%—compared to those whose eating habits slipped over time. These improvements helped regardless of age, showing that making healthier food choices later in life can still go a long way in protecting your brain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There were also notable differences in outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups. The MIND diet didn’t show a significant protective effect among Asian American participants and showed only a weak trend among Native Hawaiians. The researchers think this might come down to cultural differences in diet. Some groups may already have a lower risk of dementia, possibly because their traditional eating habits aren’t fully reflected in the MIND diet scoring system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with all observational research, this study can’t prove that the MIND diet causes a reduction in dementia risk. Other lifestyle or genetic factors could also play a role. And while the study’s large, diverse sample is a strength, the findings are considered preliminary until they’re published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The very topic of dementia can feel overwhelming, and the idea of preventing it might seem out of your hands. But this research offers an empowering takeaway: the food you eat could play a real role in protecting your brain—no matter your age. And you don’t need to overhaul your entire diet overnight to see benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The MIND diet isn’t about perfection. It’s about gradually adding in more of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-frozen-foods-for-cognitive-health-8779440" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods that support brain health&lt;/a&gt;—like leafy greens, berries, nuts, whole grains and olive oil—while cutting back on those that may do harm, such as red meat, fried foods and sweets. Even small, sustainable changes can help.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also worth reflecting on what your current diet looks like.

Starting with one or two shifts can make adopting a more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/theprep-quick-and-easy-dinners-for-better-brain-health-11704480" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;MIND-friendly eating pattern&lt;/a&gt; feel manageable and motivating.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; New research presented at the NUTRITION 2025 conference found that the MIND diet may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s and related dementias, particularly among African American, Latino and white adults. Even better, people who began following the diet later in life still saw meaningful improvements in their brain health. While more research is needed to confirm these findings, the MIND diet remains a promising, accessible strategy for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-8786846" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protecting cognitive health across your lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;As the summer travel season kicks into full gear, measles outbreaks in the U.S. and other countries have the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updating its guidance to travelers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is urging all people traveling internationally to be fully vaccinated against the virus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emily Smith, assistant professor in the Department of Global Studies at George Washington University, said the first problem is sustained transmission happening in the U.S., but the second issue is similar situations in other countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So now we’re kind of having risk in multiple ways, in multiple places,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said some of places seeing the biggest outbreaks include Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan, but due to instability in those countries, she said those areas are not seeing many visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said parts of Europe are also seeing outbreaks, which she said, similar to the U.S., are due to declining vaccination rates during the pandemic, a rise in vaccine hesitancy and changes in school requirements regarding the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccine coverage is reaching this threshold where it’s just low enough that it’s allowing measles to start to circulate,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the U.S. is among the world’s hot spots, with what she called an unprecedented and widespread outbreak leading to sustained transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It used to be in years past, maybe there was a case here,” Smith said. “Someone traveled somewhere, picked up an infection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith said vaccinations are the only way to prevent a person from getting the measles. Adults who were vaccinated as a child should be protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have younger kids that haven’t been vaccinated yet, or haven’t gotten fully vaccinated, maybe they’ve only had one dose, it would be important to get them vaccinated or get them up to date before you travel, at least a few weeks before you leave,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, people with weakened immune systems should consult their doctor before travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know if they’ve been vaccinated, there is a test that can answer that question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not vaccinated and catch measles, or are exposed to measles, you should contact your doctor right away, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You also have the chance to get what we call post-exposure prophylaxis or something to support your immune response to measles in the case that you were exposed,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                
                &lt;p class="After-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases to affect humans, and can linger in the air for up to two hours. People who visited an exposure location should monitor themselves for symptoms for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. The red facial rash typically appears about four days after someone becomes contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited an exposure location and develops symptoms should call ahead before seeking medical care, so their provider can protect other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado public health officials say people who visited the following locations — in Denver, Aurora, Glendale, Windsor, Colorado Springs and Grand Junction — are still in the window during which they could develop measles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children’s Hospital Colorado emergency department&lt;/strong&gt;, 13123 E. 16th Ave., Aurora, from 6 to 10 p.m. May 22; 1:10 to 7:15 a.m. May 26; or 9:25 p.m. May 26 to 4:15 a.m. May 27. Symptoms could develop through June 17.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walgreens&lt;/strong&gt;, 18461 E. Hampden Ave., Aurora, from 10 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. May 23; or 10 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. May 25. Symptoms could develop through June 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/strong&gt;, 880 S. Abilene St., Aurora, from noon to 3:30 p.m. May 25. Symptoms could develop through June 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Grocers&lt;/strong&gt;, 3440 S. Tower Road, Aurora, from 6 to 8:10 p.m. May 25. Symptoms could develop through June 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love’s Travel Stop and Carl’s Jr.&lt;/strong&gt;, 748 22 Road, Grand Junction, from 6 to 10 p.m. May 27. Symptoms could develop through June 17.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maverick Gas Station&lt;/strong&gt;, 2588 Airport Road, Colorado Springs, from 9 to 11:30 a.m. May 28. Symptoms could develop through June 18.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trader Joe’s&lt;/strong&gt;, 661 Logan St., Denver, between 9:30 and 11:40 a.m. May 29. Symptoms could appear through June 19.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Barrel Bar And Grill&lt;/strong&gt;, 5885 Stetson Hills Blvd., Colorado Springs, between 6 and 11:30 p.m. May 30. Symptoms could appear through June 20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;King Soopers&lt;/strong&gt;, 1750 W. Uintah St., Colorado Springs, from 8:30 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. May 31. Symptoms could develop through June 21.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;King Soopers&lt;/strong&gt;, 1520 Main St., Windsor, between 10:30 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. May 31. Symptoms could appear through June 21.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target&lt;/strong&gt;, 4301 E. Virginia Ave., Glendale, between 9:20 and 11:50 p.m. June 2. Symptoms could appear through June 23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Snake oil salesmen will be eating good during the Trump presidency. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently declared that he will greatly expand people’s access to experimental and alternative medical treatments, even while acknowledging that a “lot of charlatans” are likely to take advantage of suffering people as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.theultimatehuman.com/podcast-episodes/robert-f-kennedy-jr-how-to-fix-americas-health-crisis-as-hhs-secretary"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; the announcement during a recent interview on the Ultimate Human Podcast hosted by Gary Brecka, a self-proclaimed biologist, biohacker, and longevity expert (Brecka appears to &lt;a href="https://agemed.org/cme-conferences/florida-april-2020/faculty/gary-brecka-human-biologist/#:~:text=Gary%20has%20a%20BS%20in%20Biology%20from%20Frostburg%20State%20University%20and%20a%E2%80%AF%E2%80%AFBS%20in%20Human%20Biology%20from%20National%20College%20of%20Chiropractic."&gt;possess&lt;/a&gt; two bachelors’ degrees in biology, but is not a licensed medical doctor). Kennedy stated that, under his reign as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Americans will more easily be able to get their hands on treatments not currently approved by health regulators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you want to take an experimental drug—you can do that, you ought to be able to do that,” Kennedy told Brecka.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While many patient advocates in general have pushed for looser regulations surrounding experimental or off-label treatments, other experts have &lt;a href="https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20200303/right-to-try-a-wellintentioned-but-misguided-law"&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt; that it’s important to strike a balance between improved access and safety. And it’s unlikely Kennedy’s approach will meet that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-thought-anti-vax-was-bad-these-are-rfk-jr-s-most-disturbing-beliefs-about-health-2000524995"&gt;long spread misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines (one of the most effective medical interventions ever created), nutrition, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-spews-even-more-nonsense-on-autism-covid-in-latest-interview-2000592116"&gt;other health topics&lt;/a&gt;. And he’s no stranger to backing &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt; that have next to no evidence supporting their use. During this latest interview, for instance, he referenced chelation and stem cells as unproven therapies that people should have easier access to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stem cell medicine is a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/groundbreaking-stem-cell-therapy-repairs-badly-damaged-corneas-and-improves-sight-2000571015"&gt;legitimate and growing field&lt;/a&gt; of research. But direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics often exaggerate their benefits, claiming stem cells can treat everything from cancer to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/stem-cell-therapy-clinics-long-covid-risks-cost-1850967572"&gt;long covid&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, this cottage industry has exploded in the U.S. and overseas, and some patients have been severely injured from buying into the hype. People have experienced pulmonary embolisms, bacterial infections, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shady-stem-cell-therapies-can-cause-tumors-infections-1844543918"&gt;other serious complications&lt;/a&gt;, including blindness, from visiting these clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The risk-balance equation is arguably even worse with chelation therapy. Chelation involves using drugs that bind to heavy metals in the body, allowing them to be excreted out through urine. It’s an effective treatment for certain kinds of acute poisoning or toxic exposures. But in alternative medicine circles, &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/medical/study-gets-heart-controversial-chelation-therapy"&gt;chelation&lt;/a&gt; is regularly used to “cleanse” people of supposed toxins dubiously blamed for a bevy of chronic illnesses, including autism. As with stem cells, people have gotten hurt or &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5508a3.htm"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; after taking chelation for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK seems to be fully aware of the potential danger that would come with making these treatments easier to access, yet brushed that off as inevitable during his interview.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“And of course you’re going to get a lot of charlatans, and you’re going to get people who have bad results,” he said. “And ultimately, you can’t prevent that either way. Leaving the whole thing in the hands of pharma is not working for us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has previously warned the public to stay away from &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism#:~:text=These%20products%20claim,life%2Dthreatening%20outcomes."&gt;chelation therapy for autism&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism"&gt;unregulated stem cell treatments&lt;/a&gt;, but who knows if these warnings will stay up for much longer. Kennedy and the Trump Administration have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/moderna-pulls-promising-covid-flu-combo-shot-as-rfk-continues-antivax-campaign-2000606078"&gt;repeatedly undermined&lt;/a&gt; approved medical treatments like vaccines. Now he’s set to open the floodgates for unlicensed drugs that may not work or will harm people desperate enough to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

						Four cases of suspected botulism linked to cosmetic injections are being investigated on the South Shore, according to an advisory from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.The cases are linked to cosmetic botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, injections, which are widely used for cosmetic purposes to reduce wrinkles and fine lines. "While generally safe when administered by trained professionals, improper dosing, administration technique, or use of non-FDA-approved products may increase the risk of systemic botulism symptoms," the Mass DPH’s advisory said. Botulism is a rare, and sometimes fatal, disease caused by botulinum toxin. Initial botulism symptoms can include double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing. These symptoms could be followed by a descending, symmetric muscle weakness that progresses over hours to days.Anyone who is experiencing any of these symptoms should immediately go to the emergency room.

Nearly all (97.5%) were taking semaglutide, while 2.5% were on lixisenatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study did not exclude any specific brand of drugs, but since Wegovy was only approved in Canada in November 2021, primarily for weight loss, it is likely the bulk of semaglutide users in the study were taking Ozempic, which is prescribed for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Each patient on semaglutide or lixisenatide was matched with two patients who also had diabetes but were not taking the drugs, who shared similar characteristics such as age, gender and health conditions. The researchers then compared how many patients developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found that those who had been taking semaglutide or lixisenatide for at least six months had twice the risk of developing macular degeneration, compared with similar patients who were not taking the drugs. Patients who had been taking GLP-1 RAs for more than 30 months had more than three times the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Diabetic patients who were older and/or had had a stroke had an even higher risk of developing macular degeneration if they were on these drugs, the authors found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Marko Popovic, a co-author of the study and physician in the department of ophthalmology and vision sciences at the University of Toronto, said: “GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to have multiple effects on the eye, and in the case of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, the overall impact may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Based on our data, I would advise exercising particular caution when prescribing GLP-1 RAs to older [diabetic] patients or those with a history of stroke, as both groups were found to have an even higher risk of developing [the condition].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1599?guestAccessKey=3bb97cc4-36f2-4679-807b-4741de2fa139&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Brian VanderBeek, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said the findings suggested that large numbers of patients could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This suggests as many as one in 1,000 GLP-1 RA users could progress to new age-related macular degenaration over unexposed patients: if this risk was carried over millions of users, those affected could end up being a sizable group of patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;VanderBeek said work needed to be done to determine if this only affects patients with diabetes or if those taking these drugs for weight management or other indications are similarly at risk. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, said: “Patient safety is our top priority and we take any report about an adverse event related to the use of our medicines very seriously. We work closely with authorities and regulatory bodies from around the world to continuously monitor the safety profile of our products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These medicines have been extensively examined in Novo Nordisk’s robust clinical development programs, including randomised controlled trials, which to date have not shown any observable treatment difference compared to placebo for macular degeneration or age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, Novo Nordisk does not conclude a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use, semaglutide and age-related macular degeneration at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer of the Medicines &amp;amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, a UK watchdog, said: “Macular degeneration is not currently listed as a potential side-effect of these medicines. However, we keep the safety of these medicines under close review, including emerging evidence from scientific publications, and will take appropriate action where necessary. On the basis of the current evidence, the benefits of GLP-1 RAs outweigh the potential risks when used for the licensed indications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPRXEza3pxVmo5REtJWjZ1YWEzYzdUeXA3R1o2OEVpTS10WWR5UHA3YUQxN3hCMlJmOEI0dWFHWElCNHZpZVR1c0YtREctUUlVd3BpNXctcjVkM0V6TVlvX3Y5SngyM3RfOWlFSHQ4b1NfbzZ6NlJDNE1yNUxVNFVqVHgzdmJudDhFU2dyejdZSVhLa2lqcnpTTXVuWkQwYWVlZWhCS2hITG12UkNv</guid></item><item><title>用于新冠疫苗注射， mRNA可能有助于摆脱艾滋病毒的身体-《纽约时报》 | Used in Covid Shots, mRNA May Help Rid the Body of H.I.V. - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFAxMGxGSkdWSEVweFVONnNRVmNjRVhzX1B4UDNRbE5HZ0NhTU1FVEszN280U2JLTWNuWHQzNHlkTkNDb2c3RjlhQjdPR05HZ1I2NE9uRDl3WFgwNW5TZ0xqQ2pNdTBQTkxNWVRGNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The technology that powered Covid vaccines may also lead scientists to a cure for H.I.V. Using mRNA, Australian researchers said they were able to trick the virus to come out of hiding, a crucial step in ridding the body of it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The research, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60001-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Communications, is still preliminary, and so far, has been shown to be successful only in a lab. But it suggests that mRNA has potential far beyond its use in vaccines as a means to deliver therapies against stubborn adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Short for messenger RNA, mRNA is a set of instructions for a gene. In the case of Covid vaccines, the instructions were for a piece of the coronavirus. In the new study, they are for molecules key to targeting H.I.V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Sharon Lewin, director of the Cumming Global Center for Pandemic Therapeutics in Melbourne, who led the study, called mRNA a “miraculous” tool “to deliver things that you want into places that were not possible before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Vaccines deploying mRNA instruct the body to produce a fragment of the virus, which then sets off the body’s immune response. In the United States, the shots were initially hailed for turning back the pandemic, then viewed by some with suspicion and fear. Some officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have falsely said that they are highly dangerous and even deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccines-children-pregnant-women-rfk-jr.html" title=""&gt;sought to limit the vaccine’s availability&lt;/a&gt; to pregnant women, children and healthy younger adults.

E coli, salmonella and listeria can easily transfer from raw produce, meat and eggs to other points we touch, such as a refrigerator or faucet handle, where Wang’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJVrCnjL4a8&amp;amp;t=920s" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown they may be able to linger for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To avoid cross-contamination when cooking, wash your hands frequently and well – for 20 seconds under warm water, then dry them on a clean towel reserved especially for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Do not rinse raw&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;meat, such as chicken, she says. Doing so may help spread harmful bacteria, including via tiny airborne water droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanitize surfaces: &lt;/strong&gt;Dr Jae-Hyuk Yu, a professor of bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, recommends using a bleach solution (one tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water), an Environmental Protection Agency-registered kitchen disinfectant, or an alcohol-based spray for sanitizing hard surfaces, especially after preparing raw meat. And when handling cleaning chemicals, use gloves and ventilate well. He recommends cleaning fridge shelves monthly and ensuring your fridge is consistently under 40F to prevent bacteria from lurking around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f89ece10-bcd1-4d62-ab5a-120dc7602cf3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are microplastics really in everything – even my brain?","elementId":"f89ece10-bcd1-4d62-ab5a-120dc7602cf3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/microplastics-what-to-know"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook meat thoroughly: &lt;/strong&gt;Always cook meat to its proper internal temperature, per the United States Department of Agriculture’s &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/safe-temperature-chart" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;: 145F for whole cuts of beef, pork, lamb, veal and fish (with a three-minute rest for meat), 160F for ground meats, and 165F for all poultry. Yu uses plastic cutting boards, rather than wood, for meat. “Even clean boards can harbor microbes in grooves,” he says, so wash any kind of board well with hot water and antibacterial soap after use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="replace-or-clean-kitchen-sponges-and-dishcloths" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace or clean kitchen sponges and dishcloths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Sponges are notorious bacterial reservoirs,” says Yu. “Cleaning a knife used on raw chicken with a sponge, then using that same sponge on other dishes, can absolutely spread dangerous pathogens.” If you must use a sponge, microwave it, wet, for one to two minutes once a day or run it through the dishwasher with a heat-dry cycle, he advises. Yu replaces kitchen sponges every one to two weeks, and personally prefers sanitizable dishcloths that can be changed daily and put through a hot laundry cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="thaw-meat-properly" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thaw meat properly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While it is convenient to thaw frozen meat at room temperature, doing so “allows the outer layers to enter the ‘danger zone’ between 40F and 140F, where bacteria can multiply rapidly, long before the center is thawed,” says Yu. Instead, thaw meat in the refrigerator. If you want to cook the meat immediately, use the microwave or place it in a sealed bag and submerge it in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes. These methods keep the temperature in a safe range and limit bacterial growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoid-leaving-food-out-overnight" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid leaving food out overnight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Leaving food out at room temperature is “essentially incubating the bacteria that are in that food”, says an Idaho-based microbiologist and medical laboratory scientist certified by the American Society for Clinical Pathology who goes by the &lt;a href="https://morticiaslab.com/en-cad/pages/about" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pseudonym Morticia&lt;/a&gt; to avoid harassment as she shares food science information online. This gives them time to produce enterotoxins that can lead to symptoms like vomiting. “A lot of these toxins are heat stable,” she says. Reheating them may get rid of bacteria, “but the toxins will still make you sick”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Morticia recommends being especially careful with starchy leftovers like rice and pasta, where &lt;em&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/em&gt;, a nasty foodborne pathogen, can start to grow within hours if left out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"2b5e792f-fe71-4296-8950-c5b47e242b96","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="2b5e792f-fe71-4296-8950-c5b47e242b96" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you’re saving food for later, refrigerate it within two hours. If you’re actively eating over time – say, at an indoor party – food can stay out for up to four hours. But in hot outdoor settings such as a barbecue, that window shortens, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration and USDA &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/leftovers-and-food-safety" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; keeping refrigerated leftovers no longer than three to four days. “If you freeze food, it will stay safe to eat for a very long time,” Morticia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pay-attention-to-best-before-dates" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘best before’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Respecting these dates is one of the best ways of avoiding potential health problems,” says Dr Alvaro San Millan, an expert in bacteria at the National Center for Biotechnology in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some foods, such as packaged snacks, may be fine to eat days or weeks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;after their best before date has passed, particularly if they are unopened or have been properly stored. But it’s not always easy to tell if something has gone bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If food smells or tastes funny, that’s definitely a red flag,” says San Millan. But pathogens can accumulate without alerting our senses to trouble. “Certain bacteria, such as salmonella, can produce infections in humans even if they are at a very low concentration in the food – so low that you could never appreciate any change in a sniff or taste test,” says San Millan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most of the time, eating questionable food will probably only lead to some gastrointestinal discomfort, but “if you are unlucky and get infected by bacteria such as listeria or salmonella, or intoxicated with botulinum toxin, you may be in serious trouble,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-24" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mold can send microscopic threads throughout the cheese, contaminating more than what is visible on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For hard cheese such as cheddar, you can cut off at least 1in around and below the mold spot and keep using it,” Wang says, because fungi aren’t able to spread as quickly through denser textures. “The knife should be kept away from the moldy part to avoid cross-contamination,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-rely-on-spices-salt-or-acid-to-keep-food-safe" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t rely on spices, salt or acid to keep food safe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People have used food preservation techniques like salting and pickling for millennia. But simply adding preservative ingredients to a dish doesn’t “shield” it from bacteria. Spicy, salty or acidic elements might slow spoilage under specific conditions, as with jerky or sauerkraut, but don’t guarantee protection from harmful pathogens. There have been listeria and salmonella outbreaks from pickles, for instance, notes Morticia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-assume-organic-food-is-safer" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t assume organic food is safer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There isn’t much of a difference in regard to bacterial contamination and pathogen transmission” when it comes to organic and conventional produce, Morticia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c2004a57-78b8-4c43-8098-87c1b7547f95" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":33,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Four tips for home care, from vacuuming your mattress to … cleaning your dishwasher?","elementId":"c2004a57-78b8-4c43-8098-87c1b7547f95","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/30/four-tips-for-home-care"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, when buying local, “the supply chain is a lot shorter and fewer people are coming into contact with that food,” she says.

Common food categories such as meat, eggs, shellfish, sprouts, greens and seeded vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers are all &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8135230/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;relatively high-risk&lt;/a&gt; for contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Now is a good time for consumers to be more cautious,” says Yu, particularly with “high-risk foods like leafy greens, especially bagged lettuce”, which is prone to contamination with pathogens such as salmonella, listeria and E coli because of the way the greens are mixed from different farms and mass-processed before packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Morticia has changed her eating habits to prioritize safety in light of weaker industry regulations. “I went vegan in January, because most foodborne pathogens are zoonotic in origin, meaning they come from cows and pigs and chickens,” she says. She’s also opting for more stir-fries and fewer salads. “Cooking all of my foods significantly lowers risk,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPMURxTUcxTmlGcUVsQW55d0tWaVh1ZVFTcW1nSXZ1QlJ2S21UcEgzMVVYMlFteEpOWjdlbGhGQkM4VGpjVTlhc24ycW9MY3lRRVlmX0x5V25tcjMxclozMkVjODN6dHpZcDJLTnYyRmNhU2ZXNDBTb2QtT1pHR3BILXVLcHNBTEEtU1dYdDhRZUhpeGJoQVExVGxZbmxVZw</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州妇女在使用自来水进行鼻腔冲洗后死于脑吞噬变形虫- Scripps News | Texas woman dies from brain-eating amoeba after using tap water for nasal rinse - Scripps News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQS1RHYmFsQmFpXzRPNTJtN1k3ZjlYeURJTHQya2xDQmwwNEpwTDBFWkVaZUpSMldINHpXVTFvc3dkY05jUEZTMUdVZ0VlTVlpSkxYTXhmdlh4clhobVlCWkQ0TEc2WUpycUdzNHVDRjFuWE1Fbkx5RUN3V29RYTh1LXBDY0pxUUFHc2xSV0R0RGl2VllQeUdqRE54a3gwRkdHVVR1alkwa2VJQjVkVjA5SnpPSHFiZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal health officials said a Texas woman died after being infected by a brain-eating amoeba that she contracted after using tap water to rinse her sinuses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact source of the infection remains unknown, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believe it likely came from unboiled water used by the woman at an RV campground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;According to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&lt;/a&gt;, the woman was healthy before the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain-eating amoeba, though rare, is typically fatal once contracted.

&lt;p&gt;Exercise was in the news recently for being found in an epidemiological study to reduce the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what should be in the news is that a study published 7 years ago is going somewhat viral on the internet thanks to the profile of a popular health influencer, Dr. Rhonda Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6332782/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study found&lt;/a&gt; middle-aged adults could reverse 20 years of age-related decline in their heart muscles through a 2 year exercise program, and that it effectively turned sedentary 55-year-olds into 30-year-olds when viewed through heart activity monitoring equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that heart disease is the leading cause of death for most people in the United States, and cardiac strength is inversely correlated with heart disease, it’s probably one of the most significant studies on exercise ever carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wit, the authors describe their trial, which took 61 people and put them on an exercise regimen for 2 years, as the longest, randomized controlled trial documenting the physiological effects of supervised, structured exercise on cardiovascular health ever performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were mentioned above: 2 years of work created a heart capable of working as hard as a 30-year-old’s, as if 20 years of aging had been reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_218739" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-218739" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-218739" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1024x683.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-326x217.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-530x353.jpg 530w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-218739" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;– credit Jon Matthews&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training program started light and gradually grew in intensity and duration, with months 6-10 representing peak output. The second year was characterized by a “maintenance period” of moderate intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="This Rarely-Trained Muscle Is Recognized Worldwide as a Marker of Human Health–And the Test for Living to 100" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/this-rarely-trained-muscle-is-recognized-worldwide-as-a-marker-of-human-health-and-the-test-for-living-to-100/" rel="bookmark"&gt;This Rarely-Trained Muscle Is Recognized Worldwide as a Marker of Human Health–And the Test for Living to 100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken down, it involved specifically two interval training sessions per week, along with one hour of “base pace,” which focused on a fun activity like low to moderate-intensity sports, cycling, or hiking. At peak training load, participants were training 5–6 hours per week, while during the maintenance period of the latter 14 months, that was dropped to about 4 hours, and included the removal of one of the two interval training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bears mentioning that even the lower intensity maintenance phase involved more training than typical government prescriptions of two-and-a-half hours. But as study author Benjamin Levine said on Dr. Patrick’s show, exercise should be thought of as personal hygiene—to be done with the same routine urgency as brushing one’s teeth or showering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key point the authors &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030617" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; is that a measurement of fitness in middle age is the strongest predictor of future heart failure, and men and women of middle age who have had a lifetime of exercise behind them enjoy heart health closer to that of a 30 year old. But their study showed this could still be achieved in middle age even without a lifetime of exercise—in fact, just 2 years were required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXERCISE IS MEDICINE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="High Levels of Physical Fitness Linked to Lower Dementia Risk in Those with Genetic Predisposition" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/high-levels-of-physical-fitness-linked-to-lower-dementia-risk-for-genetic-predisposed/" rel="bookmark"&gt;High Levels of Physical Fitness Linked to Lower Dementia Risk in Those with Genetic Predisposition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also points out, however, that there are limits to exercise’s abilities of age reversal and the heart’s capacity to forgive a lifetime of sedentary behavior. If moderate-intensity training programs are started age 65 or later, they do not appear to be able to overcome the damage—specifically the heart stiffening and shrinkage—from past sedentary periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests for physicians and clinicians that middle-aged hearts retain some degree of cardiac plasticity, and may represent a more optimal time—or quite simply the last time—to intervene with aggressive lifestyle modification aimed at improving cardiac health.&lt;/p&gt;

It is often endorsed as a shortcut to better recovery, mental clarity, and overall health. People often describe it as a transformative experience. But does the science back up the hype? Let’s take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Are cold plunges really healthy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive systematic review and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317615" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by the researchers at the University of South Australia looked into the effects of cold-water immersion on health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed data from 11 studies with 3177 participants. They found that cold-water immersion may lower stress, improve sleep quality, and boost quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we noted a range of time-dependent results. Firstly, we found that cold-water immersion could reduce stress levels, but for only about 12 hours post-exposure. We also noted that participants who took 20, 60, or 90-second cold showers reported slightly higher quality of life scores.

The immediate spike in inflammation is the body’s reaction to the cold as a stressor. It helps the body adapt and recover and is similar to how exercise causes muscle damage before making muscles stronger, which is why athletes use it despite the short-term increase," the researcher added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Trump Health Scare: 'Cognitive Decline' Spotted?

Scientists at the University of Ottawa just found the effects of cold water acclimation on autophagic (the cells’ recycling system, which promotes cellular health) and apoptotic (the programmed cell death that gets rid of damaged cells) responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that repeated cold exposure significantly improves autophagic function, a critical cellular protective mechanism. This enhancement allows cells to better manage stress and could have important implications for health and longevity,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggests that cold exposure might help prevent diseases and potentially even slow down aging at a cellular level.

Clark and Dr. Robert M. Naclerio, both of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and by Dr. Eli O. Meltzer of the University of California, San Diego and La Jolla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They wrote that medications have a natural life cycle as better ones are developed and said the drug “has reached the end of its life cycle.” They recommend eliminating it as an option, but at least removing its over-the-counter availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the paper, “Diphenhydramine, once a pioneering antihistamine, is now overshadowed by second-generation antihistamines with similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Current data suggest that the adverse side-effect profile of diphenhydramine is higher among children and older adults. This has led to countries such as Germany and Sweden restricting access to first-generation antihistamines and societal guidelines advocating for the use of second-generation antihistamines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology also says first-generation antihistamines should be behind-the-counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More than 300 different formulations exist, most of them over-the-counter. Perhaps the best-known branded version is Benadryl. The paper notes diphenhydramine is also in Sominex and some combination medications like Robitussin Severe Multi-Symptom Cough Cold + Flu Nighttime and Sudafed PE Day/Night Sinus Congestion products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers noted that “diphenhydramine’s problematic therapeutic ratio has been known since the 1980s, and this significant disadvantage has not to date succeeded in stopping over a million prescriptions being written each year. The behind-the-counter status would help the pharmacist suggest safer alternatives and hopefully prevent many adverse consequences, including abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Better-second-generation-options" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Better second-generation options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The newer drugs target antihistamine receptors, while the earlier drugs are “non-selective” and bind to many more receptors throughout the body. That’s why side effects can be related to so many different organs and parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There are, per the journal paper, many safer alternatives. And price is not an issue with second-generation antihistamines, either, it noted. They cost about the same and can be purchased almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Of a drug’s life cycle, the authors wrote: “Over time, as a medicine’s usage grows, its indications may be expanded, and its safety profile becomes better understood. Eventually, competition from newer medications with equal or better efficacy or fewer adverse events exceeds the comparative risk-benefit ratio of the earlier medication, often decreasing it to the point where it should be retired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among the possible adverse effects of diphenhydramine noted in the journal are urinary retention, drowsiness, dizziness, hallucinations, cognitive problems, blurry or dry eyes, tachycardia, heart arrhythmia, skin flushing, dry mouth and constipation. The paper says diphenhydramine can interfere with sleep, and also notes “its demonstrated abuse potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Researchers wrote about the TikTok "&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.15149" target="_blank" rel="" title="Opens in a new tab or window"&gt;Benadryl challenge&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic — which led to deaths and hospitalizations" as proof of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Anything you would use Benadryl for can be replaced with cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra), or [levocetirizine (Xyzal)],” Dr. David Stukus, of Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, wrote &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJXZbtZzOQC/?igsh=MTAzbnZzZnR0aHVvOQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="" title="Opens in a new tab or window"&gt;in an Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; about the paper. “If you’re asking if any of these are safer or better, the answer is YES!!!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He continued, “Can I use one of these for an acute allergic reaction? Yes! Hives? Yes! Seasonal allergies? Yes! What if I take one of these daily and need another one? Yes! The answer is going to be yes!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Other studies have found some risks, as well. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-anticholinergic-drugs-like-benadryl-linked-to-increased-dementia-risk-20150128812" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-anticholinergic-drugs-like-benadryl-linked-to-increased-dementia-risk-20150128812"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; wrote that “common anticholinergic drugs like Benadryl are linked to increased dementia risk.” While the study, published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, noted the research didn’t prove causation, there was an association that increased with how often and how long the drug was used. The report also noted that it is known that anticholinergic drugs increase fall risk and also confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Anticholinergic drugs include not only some antihistamines including diphenhydramine, but also some tricyclic antidepressants, overactive bladder medications and some drugs for Parkinson’s disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="What's-next-for-diphenhydramine" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;What’s next for diphenhydramine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But per &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/115904?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2025-06-04&amp;amp;mh=f42c31c1ee10f5640c538e4d39fa8d62&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4uybD98Z3SthRPdc7EWyJhxVFG2NKDApV1jZV7zXp_dWEalDli3qg3TndT53kDGaPgOXBjgpBe2ywz5M8b8Naih9sC1LL3UjOZ7MkC-esD2UdiE%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Daily%20Headlines%20Evening%20-%20Randomized%202025-06-04&amp;amp;utm_term=NL_Daily_DHE_dual-gmail-definition" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/115904?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2025-06-04&amp;amp;mh=f42c31c1ee10f5640c538e4d39fa8d62&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4uybD98Z3SthRPdc7EWyJhxVFG2NKDApV1jZV7zXp_dWEalDli3qg3TndT53kDGaPgOXBjgpBe2ywz5M8b8Naih9sC1LL3UjOZ7MkC-esD2UdiE%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Daily%20Headlines%20Evening%20-%20Randomized%202025-06-04&amp;amp;utm_term=NL_Daily_DHE_dual-gmail-definition"&gt;MedpageToday&lt;/a&gt;, experts call it unlikely that diphenhydramine will leave the U.S. market. As one expert notes, Benadryl is the only readily available intravenous antihistamine in most areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Harvard Health article noted that “one of the best ways to make sure you’re taking the most effective drugs is to dump all your medications — prescription and nonprescription — into a bag and bring them to your next appointment with your primary care doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:15:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNbDVVMUFtamlMLWpKc01BTnFpend6UGpDUVAzeVpYbkxZbWtzdVo3SGtiNUZCV3VWMlF3a043eFB4bUpwZFgwbTFnUkF6dzFkMF93Ni04UXB4T2J4Yzk5ODJBV21Fc2NPa2xHc3FjMTNZajNhREVTYzdsQ1FaZ0ZWMkJNVFBnSHNQc0ZONG1sdVdzWWJYN1FoVXAyT1lPNFA3U2diQkVfaDgtREFJZVg2YlNQZEEyV0RJNWd3</guid></item><item><title>我全身麻木，服用数百万处方的常见ADHD药物后无法行走-每日邮报 | My entire body went numb and I couldn't walk after taking common ADHD drug prescribed to millions - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPMktoYWxWTGwyNGJxc3BvcE9tc25LbTlXelVWWW5uSlNlYk9ZeFFsNy1KMFhvZFUtOW53anhpdE55U0hoc3BSZ0F6LXRKWU04TlJzNU9LZDZvY2pPTE9QLUVhUDdKYm8xakhwQ2tZYjJUMG1ZaWEwSU5FdDRPLUNDMGI0VHNHN1BRcWxUU2hGbkd4OExyQ3BaUmc5Rkc0bEnSAaQBQVVfeXFMUG0tRmU5dTQ4R3RCUjkyR3RjaW9rMl9GZy1nblNVakxSSFdDRUJLMm5wUk9aTVUyWkJnNVQ1alB3VkNhMkdLSlJ4YzhGV1F6VW4ybTBmX3l0MzhYVk52R2I0cm91Sm9ta3pHRlE5V2RaT2JScXo0cnNuaDdQdkZyU2dDTU5yQkJDVDhDNUVMdXJacHN2aHVpekFCVFVFMS1wT2pFeEw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hannah Schweickert never thought a common medication for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-f61e36c0-421f-11f0-a739-09369e26ddea"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; would leave her numb from her face to her toes, at times unable to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-f62f26b0-421f-11f0-a739-09369e26ddea"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, has had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder since she was young. Doctors had prescribed her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13835837/Common-prescription-drug-taken-tens-millions-linked-five-fold-increase-mental-breakdown.html"&gt;the popular drug Adderall&lt;/a&gt;, a stimulant taken by 16million Americans known to improve focus, attention, and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She started on a low dose, standard practice doctors follow to minimize side effects, which can include insomnia, increased heart rate, anxiety, mood swings, and jitteriness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she showed no improvement, doctors increased the dosage, first to 15mg, then to 20mg, 30mg, and, finally, 40mg, her highest dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert, 25, took a 40mg tablet every day for about two months with little incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when she went on a family vacation, she began experiencing troubling symptoms she didn’t immediately connect &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11920987/Americas-Adderall-boom-laid-bare-use-women-20s-shoots-fifth-year.html"&gt;to the prescription stimulant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was scratching my neck and I couldn’t feel anything. My neck had no feeling,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That numbness spread from her neck to her fingertips, and a week later, to her cheeks, eventually taking over her whole body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hannah Schweickert, a 25-year-old with ADHD, never expected Adderall—a common stimulant used to improve focus—to leave her body numb and her mind in panic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back at college one night, alone in her room and unable to feel her bed underneath her, she panicked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I thought I was dying,’ she said, describing a destabilizing panic attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I immediately shot up, couldn’t breathe, my heart was beating out of my chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I didn’t know what a panic attack was, but that’s definitely what was happening.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert laid in a state of panic for an hour before a friend was able to get to her. She calmed herself, but it was far from the last panic attack that would strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@han.schw/video/7333417939091164459?lang=en&amp;amp;q=adhd%20medication%20side%20effects&amp;amp;t=1749044936593"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;: ‘Then that started happening every day. The worst one probably lasted about two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I couldn’t walk. My friends had to carry me to pee.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on to say she had gone to the emergency room for her panic attacks, a common response people have to the sense of chest-tightening panic that mimics a heart attack, four times over the next few months, but doctors were stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mom then suggested something that had not occurred to Schweikert previously: stop taking Adderall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Starting on a low dose to avoid typical side effects like anxiety and insomnia, she instead faced an alarming reaction that spread numbness from her toes to her face&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point, I had no feeling in my entire body,’ Schweickert said. ‘It had been 22 days with no feeling. So all my nerves, something was wrong with them.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors would test her ability to feel touch on her arms, head, and legs, and according to them, everything seemed normal. She said they were not concerned and let her leave without any answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So she took it upon herself to figure out what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert stopped taking her Adderall for a week, something doctors do not generally recommend because the withdrawal symptoms can be intense, causing depression, anxiety, headaches, muscle aches, and sleep disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some of her numbness subsided in that time. She continued her research, having seen a study that found rats given Adderall at high doses experienced considerable changes in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2017 study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394017300022"&gt;Neuroscience Letters&lt;/a&gt;, studied rats given 10mg of amphetamine (a key component of Adderall) and an antidepressant called desipramine, which extends the stimulant's effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rats’ dopamine levels plummeted and stayed low for seven days after a single dose. In addition to producing feelings of motivation and reward, dopamine can regulate pain and sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the researchers also found evidence of other neurotoxic effects in rats that could potentially explain Schweickert's reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adderall is a powerful stimulant that alters levels of neurotransmitters in the brain to improve focus, attention, and impulse control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicine starved the rats' brain cells of their energy source within an hour, making it impossible for nerve cells to send signals. This could lead to Schweiker's initial feelings of having a dead limb or tingling.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicine then overstimulated their brain cells by flooding the brain with glutamate, a chemical that can be toxic in high amounts. In humans, this could lead to hyperexcited nerves burning out, causing paralysis or numbness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug also caused a chemical 'explosion' in the brain that wiped out the brain’s natural defenses against antioxidants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, the destruction of the chemical in the brain that acts as a fire extinguisher against harmful substances called free radicals can cause nerve pain and numbness, particularly in the arms and legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's the only thing that I found on the internet in a study that I was like, actually this could be what's happening to me,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she had never heard of someone having ‘allergic or neurotoxic effects’ from Adderall, but added, 'there must be someone in the world who's also experienced this.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The feeling in Schweickert’s body did not return completely, even after six months without taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘[I got] really nervous that my feeling would never return,’ she said. ‘Now I can say that it has.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Schweickert stopped Adderall for a week—against medical advice due to withdrawal risks like depression, fatigue, and headaches—some numbness faded. But it took months for the numbness to subside completely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are few studies that delve into the potential &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12532385/Adderall-overdoses-kids-ADHD.html" class=""&gt;brain-poisoning effects&lt;/a&gt; of stimulants, including Adderall and Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maria Ingalla, an Arizona-based nurse practitioner of psychiatry, told DailyMail.com if Schweikert had taken other drugs recreationally, their effects could have compounded Adderall’s tendency to constrict blood vessels, thereby reducing blood flow and causing numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingalla said: ‘If she tried this med recently after a psychedelic or other drugs, it wouldn't be an unusual reaction because of additive effects those drugs can have on vasoconstriction and the sensory systems of the brain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert did not say in the video whether she had been taking any other medication or drug at that time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures for the number of children taking Adderall or other ADHD medications are hard to pin down due to differences in prescription databases, changing trends over time (due to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11328263/Stark-graph-shows-Adderall-prescriptions-DOUBLED-pandemic.html"&gt;the Adderall shortage&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, for instance), state-by-state variations in reporting, and the rise of telehealth prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6118829/ADHD-surged-70-percent-20-years-study-finds.html"&gt;current estimates&lt;/a&gt; say that around 10 percent of American children, aged two to 17, have been diagnosed with ADHD, and 62 percent of them are being treated with medications, translating to about 4.5 million children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:15:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPMktoYWxWTGwyNGJxc3BvcE9tc25LbTlXelVWWW5uSlNlYk9ZeFFsNy1KMFhvZFUtOW53anhpdE55U0hoc3BSZ0F6LXRKWU04TlJzNU9LZDZvY2pPTE9QLUVhUDdKYm8xakhwQ2tZYjJUMG1ZaWEwSU5FdDRPLUNDMGI0VHNHN1BRcWxUU2hGbkd4OExyQ3BaUmc5Rkc0bEnSAaQBQVVfeXFMUG0tRmU5dTQ4R3RCUjkyR3RjaW9rMl9GZy1nblNVakxSSFdDRUJLMm5wUk9aTVUyWkJnNVQ1alB3VkNhMkdLSlJ4YzhGV1F6VW4ybTBmX3l0MzhYVk52R2I0cm91Sm9ta3pHRlE5V2RaT2JScXo0cnNuaDdQdkZyU2dDTU5yQkJDVDhDNUVMdXJacHN2aHVpekFCVFVFMS1wT2pFeEw</guid></item><item><title>牛磺酸可能不是我们所希望的抗衰老奇迹- Gizmodo | Taurine Might Not Be the Anti-Aging Miracle We Hoped For - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPX1NPUWdpWmFldktKQ3FBQjRueWp1SWVsZHJTNlpaU0VnWjZaeC05Z0Y0UDk0QXJtV1JPc3l6WFVkR0RaUU04VmhaZFJaNXdNa29VWTNHUXBnVEdPM1VXRkxXUzhHbVVjOHN5ODZFT1VjSlhfQjdIb0ZTc2duMWpFMnlEZ3IyS2Q5Nm9VdWFucDM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;You might want to hold off on stockpiling taurine supplements as part of your anti-aging cocktail. Research published today failed to find evidence that our levels of taurine shrink as we get older, contrary to some earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health led the research, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adl2116"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in Science. They analyzed long-running data from past human, mice, and monkey studies, finding that taurine levels didn’t change much over time and widely varied between individual animals. The results suggest that taurine isn’t a good marker for age and throw into doubt the idea that it can prolong healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="timeline" data-v-234a609b=""&gt; &lt;p class="text" data-v-234a609b=""&gt;“Circulating taurine doesn’t decline with age in healthy individuals of these three mammalian species across the adult lifespan,” said lead study researcher Maria Emilia Fernandez, a postdoctoral fellow in the Translational Gerontology Branch of the NIH’s National Institute on Aging, in a press conference Tuesday announcing the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taurine is a semi-essential amino acid and important micronutrient. Our bodies naturally produce taurine, though it can also easily be found in animal products, supplements, and energy drinks (people once collected taurine from bulls, but it’s now &lt;a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/energydrink/is-taurine-made-from-bulls-testicles"&gt;produced&lt;/a&gt; synthetically). Taurine &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3501277/"&gt;plays&lt;/a&gt; many roles in the body, such as helping us make bile acid and keeping our blood pressure stable. In recent years, some studies have indicated that taurine—or rather, the loss of taurine—might also be a key driver of our worsening health as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2023 study that looked at several different animal models, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that taurine levels circulating in the blood declined as the animals aged. When the researchers added taurine supplements to the animals’ diets, it appeared to slightly extend the lifespan of mice and worms in addition to improving the health of older monkeys. The study also found an association between lower taurine levels in humans and an increased risk of age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though this wasn’t the first research to suggest taurine’s anti-aging potential, it certainly sparked people’s attention, including the authors behind this latest research. Not every bit of research on the topic has supported this link, however, and many studies have only analyzed taurine in people and animals at a single point in time or for a relatively brief period. The researchers behind the new study wanted to take a closer look at how these levels fluctuated over time across different species and in both males and females.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They turned to other existing studies or projects involving people, mice, and rhesus monkeys that had longitudinal data on taurine levels in the blood—meaning they could track these levels across the lifespan. Overall, they found that taurine levels didn’t decline in any of the animals or humans they studied; if anything, taurine levels usually increased over time in different groups (the sole exception being male mice). They also found that differences in taurine levels between individuals could sometimes vary significantly, and that these differences were usually larger than the changes seen over an animal’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, there doesn’t appear to be much of a connection at all between taurine and aging, at least in this research. “On the basis of these findings, we conclude that low circulating taurine concentrations are unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of aging,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are still findings from a single study, so more research will be needed to settle the question. The results also don’t mean that taurine isn’t important to our health. And it is still possible that low taurine levels can contribute to chronic health problems, including conditions that become more common as we age. Likewise, there may be some older people with low taurine who would benefit from increasing their intake.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Vijay Yadav, one of the authors behind the 2023 study, and his colleagues are currently running a randomized clinical trial testing whether taurine supplements can improve the health and fitness of middle-aged adults. He expects the trial to conclude by the end of 2025, with analysis coming soon after. For now, though, Yadav isn’t saying that people should be downing taurine like it’s candy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We cannot really recommend any supplementation. We need to have a better understanding if it does or it does not [improve health]; that can only be addressed by a placebo controlled trial,” said Yadav in the same press conference Tuesday. “And of course there are a lot more questions that need to be addressed before you can really understand the biology to more depth of a particular molecule.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While there are certainly things people can already do to stay healthier into their golden years, such as exercising regularly, the track record for anti-aging drugs or supplements overall remains spotty for the time being. And it seems that a universal fountain of youth—if we can ever truly find it—probably won’t contain any taurine.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
